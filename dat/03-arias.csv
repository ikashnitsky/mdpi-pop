(2) Does nativity mediate the race-mortality relationship in the Hispanic population? and (3) What does the Hispanic mortality advantage relative to the non-Hispanic white population look like when Hispanic race is considered? Methods: We estimated a series of parametric hazard models on eight years of mortality follow-up data and calculated life expectancy estimates using the Mortality Disparities in American Communities database. Results: Hispanic white adults experience lower mortality than their Hispanic black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Some Other Race, and multiple race counterparts. This Hispanic white advantage is found mostly among the US born. The Hispanic advantage relative to the non-Hispanic white population operates for most Hispanic race groups among the foreign born but either disappears or converts to a disadvantage for most of the non-white Hispanic groups among the US born. Contribution: Our study extends the literature on the Hispanic Mortality Paradox by revealing that the adult Hispanic population experiences racial mortality disparities that closely resemble those observed in the non-Hispanic population. The Hispanic mortality advantage is mediated not only by nativity but by race. These results indicate that race is a critical factor that should be considered in any study with the goal of understanding the health and mortality profiles of the Hispanic population in the US. © 2020","Hispanic mortality paradox; Mortality disparities; Nativity; Race","adult; African American; Alaska Native; article; Caucasian; controlled study; follow up; Hispanic; human; life expectancy; mortality","","","","","","","Arias E., Change in nuptiality patterns among Cuban Americans: Evidence of cultural and structural assimilation?, International Migration Review, 35, 2, pp. 525-556, (2001); Arias E., United States life tables by hispanic origin.

The race categories are consistent with 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, different from reports prior to 2018, which followed 1977 OMB standards. Methods—Information reported on death certificates is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Beginning in 2018, all states and the District of Columbia were using the 2003 revised certificate of death for the entire year, which includes the 1997 OMB revised standards for race. The 2019 and 2018 data based on the revised standards are not completely comparable to previous years. Selected estimates are presented in this report for both the revised and previous race standards to provide some reference for interpretation of trends. Results—In 2019, a total of 2,854,838 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 715.2 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, a decrease of 1.2% from the 2018 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 78.8 years, an increase of 0.1 year from 2018. Age-specific death rates decreased in 2019 from 2018 for age groups 45–54, 65–74, 75–84, and 85 and over and increased for age group 35–44. The 15 leading causes of death in 2019 remained the same as in 2018, although two causes exchanged ranks. Influenza and pneumonia, the eighth leading cause of death in 2018, became the ninth leading cause of death in 2019, while kidney disease, the ninth leading cause of death in 2018, became the eighth leading cause of death in 2019. The infant mortality rate, 5.58 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019, remained a historic low but was not statistically different from the rate in 2018. Conclusions—In 2019, the age-adjusted death rate decreased and life expectancy at birth increased for the total, male, and female populations for the second consecutive year. © 2021, National Center for Health Statistics.

The trend in U.S. life expectancy since 1900 has been one of gradual improvement [1]. Nevertheless, differences in life expectancy by race have persisted at least since official estimates were recorded. Measuring health disparities, including those in life expectancy, is part of the Healthy People 2020 recommendations [2]. In 1999, the difference in life expectancy between the white and black populations was 5.9 years. The gap decreased to 3.6 years in 2013. Black and white population differences in causes of death are explored to determine how they contribute to the decrease in the gap in life expectancy from 1999 through 2013. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Trends and patterns in general mortality, life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality are also described. A previous report presented preliminary mortality data for 1999. METHODS: In 1999 a total of 2,391,399 deaths were reported in the United States. This report presents tabulations of information reported on the death certificates completed by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. Original records are filed in the State registration offices. Statistical information is compiled into a national data base through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the first time in a final mortality data report, age-adjusted death rates are based upon the year 2000 population and causes of death are processed in accordance with the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). RESULTS: The 1999 age-adjusted death rate for the United States was 881.9 deaths per 100,000 standard population, a 0.7 percent increase from the 1998 rate, and life expectancy at birth remained the same at 76.7 years. For all causes of death, age-specific death rates rose for those 45-54 years, 75-84 years, and 85 years and over and declined for a number of age groups including those 5-14 years, 55-64 years, and 65-74 years. Aortic aneurysm and dissection made its debut in the list of leading causes of death and atherosclerosis exited from the list. Heart disease and cancer continued to be the leading and second leading causes of death. The age-adjusted death rate for firearm injuries decreased for the sixth consecutive year, declining 6.2 percent between 1998 and 1999. The infant mortality rate, 7.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, was not statistically different from the rate in 1998. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, mortality continued long-term trends. Life expectancy in 1999 was unchanged from 1998 despite a slight increase in the age-adjusted death rate from the record low achieved in 1998. Although statistically unchanged from 1998, the trend in infant mortality has been of a steady but slowing decline. Some mortality measures for women and persons 85 years and over worsened between 1998 and 1999.","","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Sex Distribution; United States; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; article; cause of death; child; female; human; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; sex ratio; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15518922","","","11591077","English","Natl Vital Stat Rep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035929575"

Starting with the 2019 data year, this report adds life tables for the non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) and non-Hispanic Asian populations. Methods—Data used to prepare the 2019 life tables are 2019 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2019, population estimates based on the 2010 decennial census; and 2019 Medicare data for people aged 66–99.

The methodology used to estimate the 2019 life tables for all other groups was first implemented with data year 2008. Results—In 2019, the overall expectation of life at birth was 78.8 years, increasing from 78.7 in 2018. Between 2018 and 2019, life expectancy at birth increased by 0.1 year for males (76.2 to 76.3) and by 0.2 year for females (81.2 to 81.4). In 2019, life expectancy at birth was 85.6 years for the non-Hispanic Asian population, 81.9 years for the Hispanic population, 78.8 years for the non-Hispanic White population, 74.8 years for the non-Hispanic Black population, and 71.8 years for the non-Hispanic AIAN population.

Methods-Data used to prepare the 2018 life tables are 2018 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2018 population estimates based on the 2010 decennial census; and 2018 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The methodology used to estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 2006. The methodology used to estimate the 2018 life tables for all other groups was first implemented with data year 2008. In 2018, all 50 states and the District of Columbia reported deaths by race based on the 1997 Office of Management and Budget revised standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity. As a result, race-specific life tables for 2018 presented in this report are based on the new standard and show estimates for single-race groups. These estimates are not completely comparable with those of previous years, which are based on bridged-race groups. To show trends and document the impact of changing to the 1997 standards, life expectancy estimates for 2006-2018 are reported for bridged-race categories that were in use starting with data year 2000. Results-In 2018, the overall expectation of life at birth was 78.7 years, increasing from 78.6 in 2017. Between 2017 and 2018, life expectancy at birth increased by 0.1 year for males (76.1 to 76.2) and females (81.1 to 81.2). In 2018, life expectancy at birth was 81.8 for the Hispanic population, 78.6 for the non-Hispanic single-race white population, and 74.7 for the non-Hispanic single-race black population.

METHODS: The National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) was used to evaluate death certificate classification of race and Hispanic origin by comparing death certificate with survey race-ethnicity classifications for a sample of decedents identified in NLMS. NLMS consists of a series of annual Current Population Survey files (1973 and 1978-1998) linked to death certificates for years 1979-1998. To identify and measure the effect of race-ethnicity misclassification on death certificates on mortality estimates, pooled 1999-2001 vital statistics mortality data and population data from the 2000 census were used to estimate and compare observed and corrected (for death certificate misclassification) race-ethnicity specific death rates. RESULTS: Race and ethnicity reporting on the death certificate continues to be excellent for the white and black populations. It remains poor for the American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) population but is reasonably good for the Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander (API) populations. Decedent characteristics such as place of residence and nativity have an important effect on the quality of reporting on the death certificate. The effects of misclassification on mortality estimates were most pronounced for the AIAN population, where correcting for misclassification reverses a large AIAN over white mortality advantage to a large disadvantage. Among the Hispanic and API populations, adjustment for death certificate misclassification did not significantly affect minority-majority mortality differentials.","","Continental Population Groups; Death Certificates; Ethnic Groups; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Life Expectancy; Longitudinal Studies; Reproducibility of Results; United States; article; death certificate; ethnic group; evaluation; health disparity; Hispanic; human; life expectancy; longitudinal study; race; reproducibility; statistics; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00832057","","","19024798","English","Vital Health Stat 2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-58149190624"

This analysis estimated life expectancy for five racial–ethnic groups, in 3110 US counties over 20 years, to describe spatial–temporal variations in life expectancy and disparities between racial–ethnic groups. Methods: We applied novel small-area estimation models to death registration data from the US National Vital Statistics System and population data from the US National Center for Health Statistics to estimate annual sex-specific and age-specific mortality rates stratified by county and racial–ethnic group (non-Latino and non-Hispanic White [White], non-Latino and non-Hispanic Black [Black], non-Latino and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AIAN], non-Latino and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander [API], and Latino or Hispanic [Latino]) from 2000 to 2019. We adjusted these mortality rates to correct for misreporting of race and ethnicity on death certificates and then constructed abridged life tables to estimate life expectancy at birth. Findings: Between 2000 and 2019, trends in life expectancy differed among racial–ethnic groups and among counties. Nationally, there was an increase in life expectancy for people who were Black (change 3·9 years [95% uncertainty interval 3·8 to 4·0]; life expectancy in 2019 75·3 years [75·2 to 75·4]), API (2·9 years [2·7 to 3·0]; 85·7 years [85·3 to 86·0]), Latino (2·7 years [2·6 to 2·8]; 82·2 years [82·0 to 82·5]), and White (1·7 years [1·6 to 1·7]; 78·9 years [78·9 to 79·0]), but remained the same for the AIAN population (0·0 years [–0·3 to 0·4]; 73·1 years [71·5 to 74·8]). At the national level, the negative difference in life expectancy for the Black population compared with the White population decreased during this period, whereas the negative difference for the AIAN population compared with the White population increased; in both cases, these patterns were widespread among counties. The positive difference in life expectancy for the API and Latino populations compared with the White population increased at the national level from 2000 to 2019; however, this difference declined in a sizeable minority of counties (615 [42·0%] of 1465 counties) for the Latino population and in most counties (401 [60·2%] of 666 counties) for the API population. For all racial–ethnic groups, improvements in life expectancy were more widespread across counties and larger from 2000 to 2010 than from 2010 to 2019. Interpretation: Disparities in life expectancy among racial–ethnic groups are widespread and enduring. Local-level data are crucial to address the root causes of poor health and early death among disadvantaged groups in the USA, eliminate health disparities, and increase longevity for all.

These tables are the most recent in a series of decennial life tables for the United States. Data used to prepare these state-specific life tables include population counts by age on the census date of April 1, 2000; deaths occurring in the 3-year period of 1999-2001; and counts of U.S. resident births during 1997-2001. Methods for calculating the life tables were modified from the previous decennial life tables to automate the smoothing of age-specific mortality data and to allow for the estimation of life tables for smaller population subgroups, which often had insufficient data available to estimate reliable life tables under the previous method. The current method allows for the estimation of life tables for the black population in six states, which were never previously published due to small numbers of deaths. Standard errors for estimating life expectancy and probability of dying are also presented in this report. Among the 50 states, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy at birth during the 1999-2001 period at 80.23 years, and Mississippi had the lowest life expectancy at 73.88 years. Life expectancy for the District of Columbia was even lower at 73.09 years. State-specific life expectancy at birth improved from the previous decennial period (1989-1991) for all states and the District of Columbia. Life expectancy at age 65 ranged from 20.42 years in Hawaii to 16.61 years in Kentucky. Life expectancy at age 65 also improved for all states except Kentucky.","","Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Geography; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Male; Mortality; Sex Distribution; United States; adolescent; adult; African American; age distribution; aged; article; Caucasian; child; ethnology; female; geography; human; infant; life expectancy; life table; male; mortality; newborn; preschool child; sex ratio; statistics; United States; very elderly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15518922","","","24979971","English","Natl Vital Stat Rep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878477551"

The methods used to estimate the probability of death for ages 0-80 for the Hispanic population and 0-65 for the non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations are the same as those used in annual U.S. life tables since 1997, with an important modification. Age-specific death rates are first corrected for racial and ethnic misclassification on U.S. death certificates. To address the effects of age misstatement at the oldest ages, the methodology used to estimate mortality for ages 66 and over for the non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations is the same as that used to estimate the annual life tables since 2005. For the Hispanic population, the probability of death for ages over 80 is estimated as a function of non-Hispanic white mortality with the use of the Brass relational logit model. Life expectancy at birth for the total population in 2006 was 77.7 years; 80.6 years for the Hispanic population, 78.1 years for the non-Hispanic white population, and 72.9 years for the non-Hispanic black population. The Hispanic population has a life expectancy advantage at birth of 2.5 years over the non-Hispanic white population and 7.7 years over the non-Hispanic black population. Although seemingly paradoxical, these results are consistent with the findings of numerous studies which show a Hispanic mortality advantage despite this population's lower socioeconomic status. Nonetheless, the procedures used in this report to correct for racial and ethnic misclassification and age misstatement are not error free and therefore some of the observed advantage may still be a function of data artifact. This report does not address other factors that may explain the Hispanic mortality advantage.","","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Demography; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Distribution; United States; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; article; Caucasian; child; demography; female; Hispanic; human; infant; life expectancy; life table; male; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; sex ratio; statistics; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00832057","","","21313788","English","Vital Health Stat 2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952253611"

It is the fourth in a set of reports that present life table data for the United States and each state for the period 1999-2001. Methods-The life table functions presented in this report represent the mortality experience of a hypothetical cohort assuming that a particular cause of death is eliminated. The report includes a description of the methodology used to estimate the life table functions shown in four sets of tables. Each set contains seven tables, one each for the total population, total males, total females, white males, white females, black males, and black females. Results-From birth, a person has a 31% chance of dying of Diseases of heart (heart disease) and a 22% chance of dying of Malignant neoplasms (cancer). In contrast, the probabilities of dying from Accidents (unintentional injuries), Diabetes mellitus (diabetes), and Septicemia-3 of the 10 leading causes of death in 1991-2001- are much smaller. Likewise, elimination of heart disease would increase life expectancy at birth by almost 4 years, and elimination of cancer by more than 3 years.

However, it is unknown how COVID-19 mortality affected the diverse Hispanic subpopulations. OBJECTIVE We estimate life expectancy at birth in 2019 and 2020 by select Hispanic country/region of origin and explore how changes in age-specific all-cause and COVID-19 mortality affected changes in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020 for each group. METHODS We use final 2019 and 2020 mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics and population estimates based on the 2019 and 2020 American Community Survey. We calculate life tables and apply decomposition techniques to explore the effects of changes in age and cause-specific mortality on life expectancy. RESULTS Patterns of age and cause-specific excess deaths and their impact on declines in life expectancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic differed substantially by Hispanic subgroup. Life expectancy losses ranged from 0.6 to 6.7 years among males and from 0.6 to 3.6 years among females.

Methods—Data used to prepare the 2020 state-specific life tables include: 2020 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2020, population estimates based on the 2010 decennial census; and 2020 Medicare data for people aged 66–99. The methodology used to estimate the state-specific life tables is the same as that used to estimate the 2020 national life tables, with some modifications. Results—Among the 50 states and D.C., Hawaii had the highest life expectancy at birth, 80.7 years in 2020, and Mississippi had the lowest, 71.9 years. From 2019 to 2020, life expectancy declined for all 50 states and D.C., from 0.2 years for Hawaii to 3.0 years for New York. In 2020, life expectancy at age 65 ranged from 16.1 years in Mississippi to 21.0 years in Hawaii. Life expectancy at birth was higher for females in all states and D.C. The difference in life expectancy between females and males ranged from 3.9 years in Utah to 7.0 years in D.C. © 2022, National Center for Health Statistics.

Life expectancy at birth for the U.S. population reached a record high of 78.8 years in 2012. The age-adjusted death rate for the United States decreased 1.1% from 2011 to 2012 to a record low of 732.8 per 100,000 standard population. The 10 leading causes of death in 2012 remained the same as in 2011. Age-adjusted death rates decreased significantly from 2011 to 2012 for 8 of the 10 leading causes and increased significantly for one leading cause (suicide). The infant mortality rate decreased 1.5% from 2011 to 2012 to a historic low of 597.8 infant deaths per 100,000 live births. The 10 leading causes of infant death in 2012 remained the same as in 2011. This report presents 2012 U.S. final mortality data on deaths and death rates by demographic and medical characteristics. These data provide information on mortality patterns among residents of the United States by such variables as sex, race and ethnicity, and cause of death. Information on mortality patterns is key to understanding changes in the health and well-being of the U.S. population (1). Life expectancy estimates, age-adjusted death rates by race and ethnicity and sex, 10 leading causes of death, and 10 leading causes of infant death were analyzed by comparing 2012 final data with 2011 final data.

Methods The latest version of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) was used to evaluate the classification of race and Hispanic origin on death certificates for deaths occurring in 1999-2011 to decedents in NLMS. To evaluate change over time, these results were compared with those of a study based on an earlier version of NLMS that evaluated the quality of race and ethnicity classification on death certificates for 1979-1989 and 1990-1998. NLMS consists of a series of annual Current Population Survey files (1973 and 1978-2011) and a sample of the 1980 decennial census linked to death certificates for 1979-2011. Pooled 2009-2011 vital statistics mortality data and 2010 decennial census population data were used to estimate and compare observed and corrected race-and Hispanic origin-specific death rates. Results Race and ethnicity reporting on death certificates continued to be highly accurate for both white and black populations during the 1999-2011 period. Misclassification remained high at 40% for the American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) population. It improved, from 5% to 3%, for the Hispanic population, and from 7% to 3% for the Asian or Pacific Islander (API) population. Decedent characteristics such as place of residence and nativity affected the quality of reporting on the death certificate. Effects of misclassification on death rates were large for the AIAN population but not significant for the Hispanic or API populations. © 2016, National Center for Health Statistics.

We illustrate this point using a microfile of the 1985 Colombia census of housing and population, focussing on mothers aged 15-59. While headship effects the material well-being of single, separated/divorced, and widowed mothers, mothers in a consensual union tend to be badly off materially even when they do not head their own household. Considering mothers outside consensual unions, formally married non-head mothers tend to be materially better off than non-married head mothers but not as well off as non-married non-head mothers. A country-wide analysis is refined by examining subregions, the idea being to investigate the issue in areas with potentially different marriage structures.","","Colombia; female headed household; gender issue;

Methods The National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) was used to analyze education information on the death certificate for participants in the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1992 through 1998 who died by the end of 1998. Educational attainment reported on the death certificate for these persons was compared to their educational attainment reported in the CPS. NLMS wasalsousedtocalculate classification ratios consisting of the number of deaths by education level in the CPS compared to the number of deaths by education level on the death certificate. These classification ratios were then used to produce estimates of life expectancy by education level for the United States in 2005, adjusted for probable education misreporting on the death certificate. Results Comparison of educational attainment from the death certificate and CPS shows differences due to the different classification systems used in the two sources and probable misreporting on the death certificate. The difference is most pronounced regarding graduation from high school. Black and Hispanic persons at the high school graduate level appear to be more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to have their educational attainment underreported on the death certificate as less than 4 years of high school completed. Adjusted estimates for the U.S. population show a large disparity in life expectancy by education level, on the order of 10-12 years for females and 11-16 years for males.","Health disparities; Life expectancy; Mortality; Socioeconomic status","","","","","","","","Meara E.R., Richards S., Cutler D.M., The gap gets bigger: Changes in mortality and life expectancy, by education, 1981-2000, Health Aff, 27, 2, pp. 350-360, (2008); Sorlie P.D., Johnson N.J., Validity of education information on the death certificate, Epidemiology, 7, 4, pp. 437-439, (1996); Kitagawa E.M., Hauser P.M., Differential mortality in the United States: A study in socioeconomic epidemiology, (1973); Rogot E., Sorlie P.D., Johnson N.J., Life expectancy by employment status, income, and education in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, Public Health Rep, 107, 4, pp. 457-461, (1992); Preston S.H., Elo I.T., Are educational differentials in adult mortality increasing in the United States?, J Aging Health, 7, 4, pp. 476-496, (1995); Elo I.T., Preston S.H., Educational differentials in mortality: United States, 1979-85, Soc Sci Med, 42, 1, pp. 47-57, (1996); Lin C.C., Rogot E., Johnson N.J., Sorlie P.D., Arias E., A further study of life expectancy by socioeconomic factors in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, Ethn Dis, 13, 2, pp. 240-247, (2003); Molla M.T., Madans J.H., Wagener D.K., Differentials in adult mortality and activity limitation by years of education in the United States at the end of the 1990s, Popul Dev Rev, 30, 4, pp. 625-646, (2004); Kung H.C., Hoyert D.L., Xu J.Q., Murphy S.L., Deaths: Final data for 2005, National vital statistics reports, 56, 10, (2008); Shai D., Rosenwaike I., Errors in reporting education on the death certificate: Some findings for older male decedents from New York State and Utah, Am J Epidemiol, 130, 1, pp. 188-192, (1989); Makuc D.M., Feldman J.J., Mussolino M.E., Validity of education and age as reported on death certificates, 1996 proceedings of the social statistics section, (1997); NLMS project description, (2009); The Current Population Survey: Design and methodology, (2002); Vital statistics of the United States: Mortality, 1999, (2004); U.S. standard death certificate, (2003); Mortality multiple cause of death file, (2008); Kaminski R., Adams A., Educational attainment in the United States: March 1993 and 1992, Current Population Reports, pp. 20-476, (1994); Current Population Survey annual social and economic survey data file, (2003); Arias E., Schauman W.S., Eschbach K., Et al., The validity of race and Hispanic origin reporting on the death certificates in the United States, Vital Health Stat, 2, 148, (2008); Source and accuracy of the data for the March 2005 Current Population Survey microdata file, (2005); Preston S.H., Heuveline P., Guillot M., Demography: Measuring and modeling population processes, (2001)","","","","","","","","","00832057","","","","English","Vital Health Stat.

It has also tracked an increase in solitary and couple-only living among the latter group since the turn of the century. However, it has not tracked changed living arrangements among Hispanic elders. When we do so, we find little aggregate change since 1970, but noteworthy change in different directions among different Hispanic subgroups. Thus aggregate figures for a diverse minority group may be masking very real changes and makes it all the more imperative that we consider different Latino groups separately and try to better understand issues of immigration and acculturation.","Aging; Ethnicity; Family; Hispanic; Living arrangements","United States; acculturation; elderly population; Latino people; minority group","","","","","University of Wisconsin’s Center, (P-30 AG17266); National Institute on Aging, NIA","The authors are grateful to the University of Wisconsin’s Center for the Demography of Health and Aging funded by P-30 AG17266 of the National Institute of Aging.","Angel J., Hogan D., The demography of minority aging populations, Journal of Family History, 17, 1, pp. 95-115, (1992); Angel R.J., Angel J.L., Himes C.L., Minority group status, health transitions, and community living arrangements among the elderly, Research on Aging, 14, 4, pp. 496-521, (1992); Baxter J., Bryant L.L., Scarbro S., Shetterly S.M., Patterns of rural Hispanic and non-Hispanic White health care use, Research on Aging, 23, 1, pp. 37-60, (2001); Dahlin M., Perspectives on the family life of the elderly in 1900, The Gerontologist, 20, pp. 99-107, (1980); Dahlin M., Symbols of the old age pension movement: The poorhouse, the family, and the ""childlike"" elderly, Societal Impact on Aging: Historical Perspectives, pp. 123-129, (1993); De Vos S., Holden K., Measures comparing the living arrangements of the elderly, Population and Development Review, 14, 4, pp. 688-704, (1988); del Pinal J., Singer A., Generations of diversity: Latinos in the United States, Population Bullein, 52, 3, (1997); Garcia A., Income security and elderly Latinos, Elderly Latinos: Issues and Solutions for the 21st Century, pp. 17-28, (1993); Grieco E.M., Cassidy R.C., Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin 2000, (2001); Himes C.L., Hogan D.P., Eggebeen D.J., Living arrangements of minority elders, Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 51 B, 1, (1996); Kramarow E., The elderly who live alone in the United States: Historical perspectives on household change, Demography, 32, 3, pp. 335-352, (1995); Kritz M.M., Gurak D.T., Chen L., Elderly immigrants: Their composition and living arrangements, Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare, 27, 1, pp. 85-114, (2000); Litwak E., Helping the Elderly: The Complementary Roles of Informal Networks and Formal Systems, (1985); Markides K.S., Liang J., Jackson J.S., Race, ethnicity, and aging: Conceptual and methodological issues, Handbook of Aging and the Social Sciences, pp. 112-129, (1990); McGarry K., Schoeni R.F., Social security, economic growth, and the rise in elderly widow's independence in the twentieth century, Demography, 37, 2, pp. 221-237, (2000); Mutchler J.E., Angel J., Policy development and the older Latino population in the 21st century, Journal of Aging and Social Policy, 11, 2-3, pp. 177-188, (2000); Palmore E., The Honorable Elders: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Aging in Japan, (1975); Ruggles S., Living arrangements of the elderly in America: 1880-1980, Aging and Generational Relations Over the Life Course: A Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective, pp. 254-271, (1996); Smith S.K., Nogle J.M., An experimental methodology for estimating Hispanic residents for states and counties, Journal of Economic and Social Measurement, 23, 4, pp. 263-275, (1997); Shanas E., Sussman M.B., Family, Bureaucracy, and the Elderly, (1977); Sullivan T.A., A demographic portrait, Hispanics in the United States, pp. 1-29, (2000); Public Use Samples of Basic Records from the 1970 Census: Description and Technical Documentation, (1972); Public Use Microdata Samples: Technical Documentation, (1983); Census of Population and Housing 1990: Public Use Microdata Sample: Technical Documentation, (1992); Current Population Survey March 1997: Technical Documentation (CPS-97), (1997); Current Population Survey March 1998: Technical Documentation (CPS-98), (1998); Current Population Survey March 1999 Technical Documentation (CPS-99), (1999); Current Population Survey: Annual Demographic File, 2000, (2000); Wilmoth J.M., DeJong G.F., Himes C.L., Immigrant and non-immigrant living arrangements among America's White, Hispanic, and Asian elderly population, International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy, 17, 9-10, pp. 57-82, (1997); Zsembik B.A., Preference for coresidence among older Latinos, Journal of Aging Studies, 10, 1, pp. 69-81, (1996)","S.

But differences in life expectancy between the white and black populations still exist, despite a decrease in the life expectancy gap from 5.9 years in 1999 to 3.6 years in 2013. Differences in the change over time in the leading causes of death for the black and white populations have contributed to this decrease in the gap in life expectancy. Between 1999 and 2013, the decrease in the life expectancy gap between the black and white populations was mostly due to greater decreases in mortality from heart disease, cancer, HIV disease, unintentional injuries, and perinatal conditions among the black population. Similarly, the decrease in the gap between black and white male life expectancy was due to greater decreases in death rates for HIV disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, heart disease, and perinatal conditions in black males. For black females, greater decreases in diabetes death rates, combined with decreased rates for heart disease and HIV disease, were the major causes contributing to the decrease in the life expectancy gap with white females. The decrease in the gap in life expectancy between the white and black populations would have been larger than 3.6 years if not for increases in death rates for the black population for aortic aneurysm, Alzheimer’s disease, and maternal conditions. For black males, the causes that showed increases in death rates over white males were hypertension, aortic aneurysm, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and kidney disease, while the causes that showed increases in death rates for black females were Alzheimer’s disease, maternal conditions, and atherosclerosis. This NCHS Data Brief is the second in a series of data briefs that explore the causes of death contributing to differences in life expectancy between detailed ethnic and racial populations in the United States.

Death rates are presented by race, Hispanic origin, sex, age, and cause of death. Life expectancies are presented by race (white and black), sex, and age. The revised statistics are compared with previously published statistics that used July 1, 2000, postcensal population estimates based on the 1990 census. METHODS: Data in this report are based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The statistics presented in this report are computed on the basis of two sets of population figures provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. The first set includes July 1, 2000, postcensal population estimates based on the 1990 decennial census. The second set includes April 1, 2000, populations from the 2000 decennial census bridged to single race categories. RESULTS: Crude death rates were lower for all groups using the April 1, 2000, populations. Age-specific death rates were generally lower for most age groups, except for infants and the very old for which death rates were higher. Age-specific death rates for males were lower for most age groups, except infants and those 75 years and over. For females, with the exception of infants, age-specific death rates were lower. Race-specific pattems by age for the white and black populations were similar to all races combined. For the American Indian population, age-specific death rates were substantially lower for ages under 75 years. For ages 75 years and over, American Indian death rates were dramatically higher. Age-specific death rates for the Asian or Pacific Islander (API) population were higher for ages under 15 years; lower for ages 15-84 years, especially for the 15-34 year age group; and higher for those 85 years and over. For the Hispanic population, age-specific death rates were substantially lower for those age 15-34 years and higher for those age 55 years and over, especially for those age 85 years and over. For the total white and total black populations, the age-adjusted death rate was somewhat higher for males and lower for females. For API the pattern was reversed. For the American Indian and Hispanic populations, age-adjusted death rates were higher for both males and females. For the 15 leading causes of death, age-adjusted death rates based on the April 1, 2000, population figures were lower for heart disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, septicemia, diabetes, chronic lower respiratory diseases, unintentional injuries, homicide, suicide, and hypertension. Age-adjusted death rates were higher for pneumonitis, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. Rates were unchanged for influenza and pneumonia and nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis. Life expectancy at birth was higher for the entire population and both the white and black populations using the April 1, 2000, population figures. It was 0.1 year higher for the whole population as well as for the total white and total black populations. For the total male population, life expectancy at birth was 0.1 year higher while it was 0.2 years higher for the female population. The increase in life expectancy at birth was 0.1 year for both sexes within the white and black populations. This observed gain in life expectancy at birth based on the revised population figures is reversed for life expectancy at the oldest age groups for the whole population and for males. A similar pattern is observed for both white and black males; however, the magnitude of the decline in life expectancy at older ages is much greater among black males. Among females of both race groups and the total population, there is either no change or an increase in life expectancy in the oldest age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Revised death rates and life expectancies are, in many cases, significantly different from previously published mortality statistics calculated using 1990-based postcensal estimates for 2000. Thus, previously published mortality statistics for 2000 using the 1990-based populations will not be comparable to the corresponding statistics that will be published for 2001. The data in this report will provide comparable 2000 data. Efforts are also underway to revise previously published mortality tables for 2000 as well as previously published data for 1991-99.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; United States; adolescent; adult; aged; article; child; comparative study; female; human; infant; information processing; life expectancy; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15518922","","","12795490","English","Natl Vital Stat Rep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0038341625"

Trends and patterns in general mortality, life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality are also described. A previous report presented preliminary mortality data for 2001. METHODS: In 2001 a total of 2,416,425 deaths were reported in the United States. This report presents descriptive tabulations of information reported on the death certificates. Funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners complete death certificates. Original records are filed in the State registration offices. Statistical information is compiled into a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Causes of death are processed in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10). RESULTS: The age-adjusted death rate for the United States in 2001 was 854.5 deaths per 100,000 standard population, representing a decrease of 1.7 percent from the 2000 rate and a record low historical figure. Life expectancy at birth rose by 0.2 years to a record high of 77.2 years. Considering all deaths, age-specific death rates rose only for those 25-44 years, and declined for a number of age groups including those under 1 year, 5-14 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, and 85 years and over. The 15 leading causes of death in 2001 remained the same as in 2000. Heart disease and cancer continued to be the leading and second leading causes of death, together accounting for over half of all deaths. Homicide became the 13th leading cause in 2001, rising from the 14th leading cause in 2000 as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The infant mortality rate remained at a record low level, declining slightly but insignificantly from 6.9 in 2000 to 6.8 in 2001. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, mortality patterns in 2001 were consistent with long-term trends. Life expectancy in 2001 increased again to a new record level. The age-adjusted death rate declined to a record low historical figure. Although statistically unchanged from 2000, the trend in infant mortality has shown a steady, although slowing, decline. The declining trend in the homicide death rate was reversed primarily as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; United States; adolescent; adult; aged; article; child; comparative study; female; human; infant; life expectancy; male; middle aged; mortality; preschool child; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15518922","","","14570230","English","Natl Vital Stat Rep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0346139143"

METHODS: Data used to prepare these life tables include population data by age on the census date April 1, 2000; deaths occurring in the 3-year period 1999-2001 classified by age at death; births for each of the years 1997-2001; and Medicare data for ages 66-100 years from the years 1999-2001. Methods that were kept the same as those of previous decennial tables include data sources used in constructing tables, the preliminary adjustment for misreported ages, the smoothing techniques for vital statistics and census data, and the calculations of death rates in different age groups. Two significant changes were made to the methodology used to estimate mortality for the populations aged 66 years and over. First, Medicare data were used to supplement vital statistics (number of deaths) and census data (population estimates) starting at age 66 years instead of age 85 years as was done in the estimation of previous U.S. decennial life tables. Second, smoothing and extrapolation of death rates for ages 66-109 was performed using a mathematical model given by Heligman and Pollard, instead of a Whittaker-Henderson Type B formula or modified Gompertz method.","","Censuses; Female; Humans; Life Tables; Male; Medicare; Mortality; Probability; United States; Vital Statistics; article; female; human; life table; male; medicare; mortality; population research; probability; statistics; United States; vital statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15518922","","","18783078","English","Natl Vital Stat Rep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-53049085756"

Improving the immediacy of care could have important impact on coronary mortality. Methods The objective of this research is to identify factors associated with the occurrence of out-of-hospital coronary heart disease death as compared with in-hospital. Identification of these factors could lead to additional strategies for rapid treatment of coronary attack symptoms. A large national cohort study with individually identified characteristics was matched to the National Death Index to identify deaths by cause occurring in up to 11 years of follow-up. Approximately 60,000 deaths occurred in the cohort of approximately 700,000 participants aged 25 years or more. Location of death was defined as either in- or out-of-hospital. Results Among deaths classified as coronary heart disease (CHD), multivariate logistic models of the association between selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of individuals prior to death and place of death show that black persons are more likely to die out of hospital, as are persons who live alone or are unmarried, persons at the lowest end of the income distribution, and persons who live in rural areas vs. urban areas. Conclusions The factors most strongly associated with a CHD death occurring out-of-hospital as compared with in-hospital are race (black persons are 1.23 times more likely to die out of hospital than white persons, net of demographic and socioeconomic differentials) and living status (persons who are not married are 1.60 times more likely to die out of hospital than persons who are married, net of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics). Attention should be paid to these groups to emphasize the need for rapid attention to the signs of a coronary attack so that rapid and potentially life saving intervention can be implemented. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We estimated complete period life tables for the non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population residing in Contract Health Service Delivery Area (CHSDA) counties for the period 2007-2009. Methods. We used National Vital Statistics System mortality data files for years 2007-2009 corrected for AI/AN misclassification on death certificates, midyear 2008 revised census bridged race intercensal population estimates, and National Vital Statistics System birth data for years 2006-2009. We used the same methodology as that used to estimate official US annual life tables, with some minor modifications. Results. For the period 2007-2009, the non-Hispanic AI/AN population in CHSDA counties had the lowest life expectancy at birth (71.1 years) of any racial/ethnic group for which official US life tables are estimated. By comparison, in 2008, life expectancy at birth was 73.9 years for the non-Hispanic Black population, 78.4 years for the non-Hispanic White population, and 80.8 years for the Hispanic population. Conclusions. The life tables showed a clear mortality disadvantage for the non-Hispanic AI/AN population in CHSDA counties relative to other national populations. The findings suggested that further research is necessary to explore the causes behind these disadvantages.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alaska; Birth Certificates; Child; Child, Preschool; Death Certificates; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Inuits; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Pregnancy; United States; adolescent; adult; aged; American Indian; article; birth certificate; child; death certificate; ethnology; female; human; infant; Inuit; life expectancy; life table; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; pregnancy; preschool child; statistics; United States; very elderly","","","","","","","Arias E., United States life tables 2008, Natl Vital Stat Rep, 61, 3, pp. 1-64, (2012); Arias E., United States life tables by Hispanic origin, Vital Health Stat, 2, 152, pp. 1-33, (2010); Arias E., Schauman W.S., Eschbach K., Et al., The validity of race and Hispanic origin reporting on death certificates in the United States, Vital Health Stat, 2, 148, pp. 1-23, (2008); Preston S.H., Elo I.T., Steward Q., Effects of age misreporting on mortality estimates at older ages, Popul Stud (Camb), 53, 2, pp. 165-177, (1999); Anderson R.N., A method for constructing complete annual US life tables, Vital Health Stat, 2, 129, pp. 1-28, (2000); Espey D.K., Ma J., Richards T.B., Begay C., Haverkamp D., Roberts D., Methods for improving the quality and completeness of mortality data for American Indians and Alaska Natives, Am J Public Health, 104, 6 SUPPL. 3, (2014); Ma J., Arias E., Seneca D.S., Et al., Racial misclassification of American Indians and Alaska Natives by Indian Health Service Contract Health Service Delivery Area, Am J Public Health, 104, 6 SUPPL. 3, (2014); US Census Populations with Bridged Race Categories, (2013); Reported Health and Health-influencing Behaviors among Urban American Indians and Alaska Natives: An Analysis of Data Collected by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, (2008); Updated United States Life Tables, (2008); Martin J.A., Hamilton B.E., Sutton P.D., Ventura S.J., Mathews T.J., Mjk O., Births: Final Data for 2008 Natl Vital Stat Rep, 59, 1, pp. 1-72, (2010); User Guide to the 2008 Natality Public Use File, (2013); Preston S., Heuveline P., Guillot M., Demography: Measuring and Modeling Population Processes, (2000); Himes C.L., Preston S.H., Condran G.A., A relational model of mortality at older ages in low mortality countries, Popul Stud (Camb), 48, 2, pp. 269-291, (1994); Preston S.H., Elo E.T., Black mortality at very old ages in official US life tables: A skeptical appraisal, Popul Dev Rev, 32, 3, pp. 557-566, (2006); Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, (2008); American Community Survey, (2006); Espey D.K., Ma J., Cobb N., Et al., Leading causes of death and all-causemortality in American Indians and Alaska Natives, Am J Public Health, 104, 6 SUPPL. 3, (2014); Kunitz S., Veazie M., Henderson J.A., Historical trends and regional differences in all-cause and amenablemortality among American Indians and Alaska Natives since 1950, Am J Public Health, 104, 6 SUPPL. 3, (2014)","E.

Standard mortality statistics, adjusted for race and Hispanic-origin misclassification on death certificates, are provided along with comparisons with the three major U.S. populations: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic. Methods—The data used to produce the mortality statistics shown in this report include final mortality data for 2019; July 1, 2019, population estimates based on the 2010 decennial census; the 2018 and 2019 linked birth/infant death data files; and a data set consisting of 2010 decennial census AIAN records linked to mortality data. Age-specific and age-adjusted death rates, leading causes of death, and life expectancy estimates are adjusted for race and Hispanic-origin misclassification using adjustment factors produced from the census-mortality-linked data set. Results—After adjusting for misclassification, the non-Hispanic AIAN population experienced substantially higher mortality than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic populations in the United States. Non-Hispanic AIAN persons experienced greater all-cause mortality, higher age-specific death rates at most ages but particularly at younger ages, and higher mortality for most of the top leading causes of death. They also had the lowest life expectancy at birth (71.8) compared with the non-Hispanic white (78.8), non-Hispanic black (74.8), and Hispanic (81.9) populations. © 2021, National Center for Health Statistics.

We tested the data artifact hypothesis regarding the Hispanic mortality advantage by investigating whether and to what degree this advantage is explained by Hispanic origin misclassification on US death certificates. Methods. We used the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, which links Current Population Survey records to death certificates for 1979 through 1998, to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and net ascertainment of Hispanic ethnicity on death certificates compared with survey classifications. Using national vital statistics mortality data, we estimated Hispanic age-specific and age-adjusted death rates, which were uncorrected and corrected for death certificate mis-classification, and produced death rate ratios comparing the Hispanic with the non-Hispanic White population. Results. Hispanic origin reporting on death certificates in the United States is reasonably good. The net ascertainment of Hispanic origin is just 5% higher on survey records than on death certificates. Corrected age-adjusted death rates for Hispanics are lower than those for the non-Hispanic White population by close to 20%. Conclusions. The Hispanic mortality paradox is not explained by an incon-gruence between ethnic classification in vital registration and population data systems.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Death Certificates; Ethnic Groups; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Sensitivity and Specificity; United States; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; article; child; classification; death certificate; ethnic group; ethnology; female; Hispanic; human; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; sensitivity and specificity; United States","","","","","National Cancer Institute, NCI, (P50CA105631)","","Markides K.S., Corail J., The health of Hispanics in the southwestern United States: An epidemiologic, paradox, Public Health Rep, 101, 3, pp. 253-265, (1986); Hummer R.A., Powers D.A., Pullum S.G., Gossman G.L., Frisbie W.P., Paradox found (again): Infant mortality among the Mexican-origin population in the United States, Demography, 44, 3, pp. 441-457, (2007); Palloni A., Arias E., Paradox lost: Explaining the Hispanic adult mortality advantage, Demography, 41, 3, pp. 385-415, (2004); Franzini L., Ribble J.C., Keddie A.M., Understanding the Hispanic paradox, Ethn Dis, 11, 3, pp. 496-518, (2001); Elo I.T., Turra C.S., Kestenbaum B., Ferguson B.R., Mortality among elderly hispanics in the United States: Past evidence and new results, Demography, 41, 1, pp. 109-128, (2004); Sorlie P.D., Backlund E., Johnson N.J., Rogot E., Mortality by hispanic status in the united states, Journal of the American Medical Association, 270, 20, pp. 2464-2468, (1993); Singh G.K., Siahpush M., Ethnic-immigrant differentials in health behaviors, morbidity, and cause-specific mortality in the United States: An analysis of two national data bases, Human Biology, 74, 1, pp. 83-109, (2002); Smith D.P., Bradshaw B.S., Rethinking the Hispanic paradox: Death rates and life expectancy for US non-Hispanic White and Hispanic populations, Am J Public Health, 96, 9, pp. 1686-1692, (2006); Sortie P.D., Rogot E., Johnson N.J., Validity of de-mographic characteristics on the death certificate, Epi-demiology, 3, 2, pp. 181-184, (1992); Rosenberg H.M., Maurer J.D., Sortie P.D., Et al., Quality of death rates by race and Hispanic origin: A summary of current research, 1999, Vital Health Stat, 2, 128, pp. 1-13, (1999); Swallen K., Guend A., Data quality and adjusted Hispanic mortality in the United States, 1989-1991, Ethn Dis, 13, 1, pp. 126-133, (2003); Eschbach K., Kuo Y.-F., Goodwin J.S., Ascertainment of Hispanic ethnicity on California death certificates: Implications for the explanation of the Hispanic mortality advantage, American Journal of Public Health, 96, 12, pp. 2209-2215, (2006); Buechley R.W., A reproducible method of counting persons of Spanish surname, J Am Stat Assoc, 56, 293, pp. 88-97, (1961); Sullivan T.A., Gillespie F.P., Hout M., Rogers R.G., Alternative estimates of Mexican-American mortality in Texas, 1980, Soc Sci.

The race categories are consistent with 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, which are different from previous reports (1977 OMB standards). Methods-Information reported on death certificates is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. As of 2018, all states and the District of Columbia were using the 2003 revised certificate of death, which includes the 1997 OMB revised standards for race. The 2018 data based on the revised standards are not completely comparable to previous years. Selected estimates are presented in this report for both the revised and previous race standards to provide some reference for interpretation of trends. Results-In 2018, a total of 2,839,205 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 723.6 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, a decrease of 1.1% from the 2017 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 78.7 years, an increase of 0.1 year from 2017. Age-specific death rates decreased in 2018 from 2017 for age groups 15-24, 25-34, 45-54, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and over. The 15 leading causes of death in 2018 remained the same as in 2017. The infant mortality rate decreased 2.2% to a historically low figure of 5.66 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2018. Conclusions-The age-adjusted death rate for the total, male, and female populations decreased from 2017 to 2018, and life expectancy at birth increased in 2018 for the total, male, and female populations.

We develop a comparative scale from six housing items (wall material, floor material, roof material, availability of electricity, type of sewerage and water facilities) since these items are recommended by the U.N., tend to be present in most housing censuses, tend to be highly related to each other and tend to have a similar valuation. A more basic three-item scale, consisting of the last three items listed above, is also discussed because this scale might be even more widely available while providing valuable, aggregated, information. The six-item and three-item scales correlate highly with each other. There is a wide range among Latin American countries in people's distribution along the scales but the scales themselves seem applicable everywhere. Not only have they been proving useful in our own research, but both scales correlate fairly well with a country's infant mortality rate on the aggregate level and with an individual's educational attainment among men and women 15 to 59 and among elderly people 60 years of age and older. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","Latin America; developing region; housing quality; methodological evaluation; social indicators; socioeconomic status; status indicator","","","","","","","Arias E., Change in the Prevalence of Female Headed Households: the Cases of Chile and Paraguay (1970-1980), (1994); Baer W.C., The evolution of housing indicators and housing standards, Public Policy, 24, pp. 361-393, (1976); Carmines E., Zeller R., Reliability and Validity Assessment, (1979); De Vellis R.F., Scale Development, (1991); De Vos S., Palloni A., Arias E., Rafalimanana H., Demographics and change, stability, and patterns in Latin American households, Population Association of America Meetings in San Francisco, (1995); Duncan O.D., A socioeconomic index for all occupations, Occupations and Social Status, pp. 109-138, (1961); Ganzeboom H.B., De Graaf P.M., Treiman D.J., De Leeuw J., A standard international socio-economic index of occupational status, Social Science Research, 21, pp. 1-56, (1992); Goedert J.E., Goodman Jr. J.L., Indicators of the Quality of U.S. Housing, (1977); Goldthorpe J.H., Hope K., The Social Grading of Occupations, (1974); Goodman Jr. J.L., Causes and indicators of housing quality, Social Indicators Research, 5, pp. 195-210, (1978); Koebel C.T., Estimating substandard housing for planning purposes, Journal of Planning - Education & Research, 5, pp. 191-202, (1986); Matras J., Social Inequality, Stratification and Mobility, (1984); Nam C.B., Powers M.G., The Socioeconomic Approach to Status Measurement with a GUIDE to Occupational and Socioeconomic Status Scores, (1983); Nunnally J.C., Psychometric Theory, (1978); Reiss Jr. A.J., Occupations and Social Status, (1961); Reiss Jr. A.J., Social correlates of occupational prestige status, Occupations and Social Status, pp. 83-88, (1961); Treiman D.J., Occupation Prestige in Comparative Perspective, (1977); Compiling Social Indicators on the Situation of Women, Studies in Methods Series F No.32, (1984); Improving Concepts and Methods for Statistics and Indicators on the Situation of Women, Studies in Methods Series F No. 33, (1984); Improving Statistics and Indicators on Women Using Household Surveys, Studies in Methods Series F No. 48, (1988); Handbook of Social Indicators, Studies in Methods Series F No. 49, (1989)","","","Springer Netherlands","","","","","","03038300","","","","English","Soc.

Methods—Data used to prepare the 2014 life tables are 2014 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2014 population estimates based on the 2010 decennial census; and 2014 Medicare data for persons aged 66–99. The methodology used to estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from the methodology developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 2006. The methodology used to estimate the 2014 life tables for all other groups was first implemented with data year 2008. Results—In 2014, the overall expectation of life at birth was 78.9 years, a 0.1-year increase from 2013. Between 2013 and 2014, life expectancy at birth increased by 0.1 year for both males (76.4 to 76.5) and females (81.2 to 81.3) and for the black (75.5 to 75.6) and white (79.0 to 79.1) populations. Life expectancy at birth increased by 0.2 years for the Hispanic (81.9 to 82.1) and non-Hispanic black (75.1 to 75.3) populations. Life expectancy at birth remained unchanged for the non-Hispanic white population (78.8). © 2018, National Center for Health Statistics.

We evaluated the racial misclassification of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) in cancer incidence and all-cause mortality data by Indian Health Service (IHS) Contract Health Service Delivery Area (CHSDA). Methods. We evaluated data from 3 sources: IHS-National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), IHS-National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)/Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, and National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS). We calculated, within each data source, the sensitivity and classification ratios by sex, IHS region, and urban-rural classification by CHSDA county. Results. Sensitivity was significantly greater in CHSDA counties (IHS-NVSS: 83.6%; IHS-NPCR/SEER: 77.6%; NLMS: 68.8%) than non-CHSDA counties (IHSNVSS: 54.8%; IHS-NPCR/SEER: 39.0%; NLMS: 28.3%). Classification ratios indicated less misclassification in CHSDA counties (IHS-NVSS: 1.20%; IHS-NPCR/SEER: 1.29%; NLMS: 1.18%) than non-CHSDA counties (IHS-NVSS: 1.82%; IHSNPCR/SEER: 2.56%; NLMS: 1.81%). Race misclassification was less in rural counties and in regions with the greatest concentrations of AI/AN persons (Alaska, Southwest, and Northern Plains). Conclusions. Limiting presentation and analysis to CHSDA counties helped mitigate the effects of race misclassification of AI/AN persons, although a portion of the population was excluded.","","Alaska; Female; Humans;

Methods—Data used to prepare the 2021 state-specific life tables include: 2021 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2021, population estimates based on the Blended Base population estimates produced by the U.S. Census Bureau; and 2021 Medicare data for people ages 66–99. The methodology used to estimate the state-specific life tables is the same as that used to estimate the 2021 national life tables, with some modifications. Results—Among the 50 states and District of Columbia, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy at birth, 79.9 years in 2021, and Mississippi had the lowest, 70.9 years. From 2020 to 2021, life expectancy at birth declined for 39 states, increased for 11 states, and remained unchanged for the District of Columbia. In 2021, life expectancy at age 65 ranged from 16.1 years in Mississippi to 20.6 years in Hawaii. Life expectancy at birth was higher for females in all states and the District of Columbia. The difference in life expectancy between females and males ranged from 3.9 years in Utah to 7.6 years in New Mexico. © 2024, National Center for Health Statistics.

Methods—Data used to prepare the 2020 life tables are 2020 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2020, population estimates based on the 2010 decennial census; and 2020 Medicare data for people aged 66–99. The methodology used to estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 2006. The same methodology is used to estimate the life tables for the non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) and non-Hispanic Asian populations. The methodology used to estimate the 2020 life tables for all other groups was first implemented with data year 2008. Results—In 2020, the overall expectation of life at birth was 77.0 years, decreasing 1.8 years from 78.8 in 2019. From 2019 to 2020, life expectancy at birth decreased by 2.1 years for males (76.3 to 74.2) and by 1.5 years for females (81.4 to 79.9). In 2020, life expectancy decreased from 2019 by 4.7 years for the non-Hispanic AIAN population (71.8 to 67.1) and by 4.0 years for the Hispanic population (81.9 to 77.9), 3.3 years for the non-Hispanic Black population (74.8 to 71.5), 2.0 years for the non-Hispanic Asian population (85.6 to 83.6), and 1.4 years for the non-Hispanic White population (78.8 to 77.4). © 2022, National Center for Health Statistics.

Methods—Information reported on death certificates is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Results—In 2017, a total of 2,813,503 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 731.9 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, an increase of 0.4% from the 2016 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 78.6 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from the 2016 rate. Life expectancy decreased from 2016 to 2017 for non-Hispanic white males (0.1 year) and non-Hispanic black males (0.1), and increased for non-Hispanic black females (0.1). Age-specific death rates increased in 2017 from 2016 for age groups 25–34, 35–44, and 85 and over, and decreased for age groups under 1 and 45–54. The 15 leading causes of death in 2017 remained the same as in 2016 although, two causes exchanged ranks. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, the 12th leading cause of death in 2016, became the 11th leading cause of death in 2017, while Septicemia, the 11th leading cause of death in 2016, became the 12th leading cause of death in 2017. The infant mortality rate, 5.79 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2017, did not change significantly from the rate of 5.87 in 2016. Conclusions—The age-adjusted death rate for the total, male, and female populations increased from 2016 to 2017 and life expectancy at birth decreased in 2017 for the total and male populations. © 2019, National Center for Health Statistics.

Methods—Information reported on death certificates, which are completed by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners, is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Results—In 2015, a total of 2,712,630 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 733.1 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, an increase of 1.2% from the 2014 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 78.8 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from 2014. Life expectancy decreased from 2014 to 2015 for non-Hispanic white males (0.2 year), non-Hispanic white females (0.1), non-Hispanic black males (0.4), non-Hispanic black females (0.1), Hispanic males (0.1), and Hispanic females (0.2). Age-specific death rates increased in 2015 from 2014 for age groups 5–14, 15–24, 25–34, 35–44, 55–64, 65–74, and 85 and over. The 15 leading causes of death in 2015 remained the same as in 2014. The infant mortality rate, 5.90 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015, did not change significantly from the rate of 5.82 in 2014. Conclusions—The age-adjusted death rate increased for the first time since 2005. Life expectancy for the total population decreased for the first time since 1993. © 2018, National Center for Health Statistics.

Methods The latest version of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) was used to evaluate the classification of race and Hispanic origin on death certificates for deaths occurring in 1999–2011 to decedents in NLMS. To evaluate change over time, these results were compared with those of a study based on an earlier version of NLMS that evaluated the quality of race and ethnicity classification on death certificates for 1979–1989 and 1990–1998. NLMS consists of a series of annual Current Population Survey files (1973 and 1978–2011) and a sample of the 1980 decennial census linked to death certificates for 1979–2011. Pooled 2009–2011 vital statistics mortality data and 2010 decennial census population data were used to estimate and compare observed and corrected race- and Hispanic origin-specific death rates.  Results Race and ethnicity reporting on death certificates continued to be highly accurate for both white and black populations during the 1999–2011 period. Misclassification remained high at 40% for the American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) population. It improved, from 5% to 3%, for the Hispanic population, and from 7% to 3% for the Asian or Pacific Islander (API) population. Decedent characteristics such as place of residence and nativity affected the quality of reporting on the death certificate. Effects of misclassification on death rates were large for the AIAN population but not significant for the Hispanic or API populations.","","Continental Population Groups; Death Certificates; Ethnic Groups; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Life Expectancy; Longitudinal Studies; Reproducibility of Results; United States; ancestry group; death certificate; epidemiology; ethnic group; health disparity; Hispanic; human; life expectancy; longitudinal study; reproducibility; statistics and numerical data; trends; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00832057","","","28436642","English","Vital Health Stat 2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044692455"

The methodology used to estimate the 2011 life tables was first implemented with data year 2008. The methodology used to estimated the life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 2006.; RESULTS: In 2011, the overall expectation of life at birth was 78.7 years--unchanged from 2010.

However, the Census Bureau has not released nor plans to release research showing the impact of these changes. We explore the impact of the Census Bureau's procedural changes on the racial and ethnic distributions of the Hispanic (generally and by country of origin) and the American Indian and Alaska Native populations, the two populations most impacted by these changes. We use the 2019 and 2021 one-year ACS public-use microdata and 2019 and 2021 NCHS mortality data to compare racial distributions and estimate and compare select demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and mortality measures across the two years. Our results show that changes the Census Bureau implemented beginning with the 2020 decennial census and ACS appear to have had a significant impact on the comparability of Census Bureau race and ethnicity data. We find a significant data discontinuity impacting a wide variety of demographic, socioeconomic, and mortality statistics and analyses that rely on U.S. Census Bureau data as input for calculations. To mitigate these effects, methods that bridge race and ethnicity data between pre- and post-2020 census data are needed. Our research brings new attention and clarity to the race and ethnicity data discontinuity in Census Bureau data that started in 2020. © 2025","Census race coding changes; Census race question; Ethnicity; Hispanic; Latino; Multiple race; Race; Racial population composition; Some Other Race","","","","","","","","Arias E., Heron M., Hakes J.K., The validity of race and Hispanic origin reporting on death certificates in the United States: An update, Vital health stat 2(172), (2016); Arias E., Johnson N.J., Vera B.T., Racial disparities in mortality in the adult hispanic population, SSM-population health, 11, (2020); Arias E., Schauman W.S., Eschbach K., Sorlie P.D., Backlund E., The validity of race and Hispanic origin reporting on death certificates in the United States, National Center for Health Statistics.

Effects of educational, income, employment, and marital status on life expectancy are presented and interpreted. Design: The National Longitudinal Mortality Study, consisting of a number of Current Population Surveys (CPS) linked to mortality information obtained from the National Death Index, provides data to construct life tables for various socioeconomic and demographic groups. Probabilities of death are estimated using a person-year approach to accommodate the aging of the population over 11 years of follow up. Results: Across various ethnicity-race-sex groups, longer life expectancy was observed for individuals with higher levels of education and income, and for those who were married and employed. The differences in life expectancy between levels of the socioeconomic characteristics tended to be larger for men than for women. Also, differences were found to be larger for the non-Hispanic Black population compared to the non-Hispanic White population. Hispanic White men exhibited patterns similar to those of non-Hispanic White and Black men. Conclusions: For selected ethnicity-race-sex groups, the impact of socioeconomic variables on life expectancy is dramatic. The shorter life expectancy observed among the poor, the less educated, the unmarried, and those not in the labor force, highlights the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage on survival. Further, the substantial 14-year differential favoring the employed over those not in the labor force may be partially explained by unemployment due to poor health. Another reason may be that employed individuals have greater access to health care than do those not in the labor force.","Life expectancy; Longtudinal Study; Mortality; Socioeconomic factor","Adult; African Americans; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Life Expectancy; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mortality; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; adult; age; aging; article; Caucasian; controlled study; demography; education; employment; ethnic group; female; follow up; gender; health care utilization; health survey; human; income; life expectancy; longitudinal study; male; marriage; mortality; negro; probability; race; register; sex difference; socioeconomics; survival","","","","","","","Kitagawa E.M., Hauser P.M., Differential Mortality in the United States: A Study in Socioeconomic Epidemiology, (1973); Rogot E., Sorlie P., Johnson N.J., Life expectancy by employment status, income, and education in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, Public Health Rep., 107, pp. 457-461, (1992); Pamuk E., Makuc D., Heck K., Reuben C., Lochner K., Health, United States, 1998 with Socioeconomic Status and Health Chartbook, (1998); Rogot E., Sorlie P., Johnson N.J., Glover C.S., Treasure D.W., A Mortality Study of One Million Persons by Demographic, Social, and Economic Factors: 1979-1981 Follow-up, (1988); National Death Index User's Manual, (1990); The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology, (2000); Rogot E., Sorlie P., Johnson N.J., Probabilistic methods in matching census samples to the National Death Index, J.

Methods The National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) was used to evaluate death certificate classification of race and Hispanic origin by comparing deatcertificate with survey race-ethnicity classifications for a sample of decedents identified in NLMS. NLMS consists of a series of annual Current Population Survey files (1973 and 1978-1998) linked to death certificates for years 1979-1998. To identify and measure the effect of race-ethnicity misclassification on death certificates on mortality estimates, pooled 1999-2001 vital statistics mortality dataand population data from the 2000 census were used to estimate and compare observed and corrected (for death certificate misclassification) race-ethnicity specific death rates. Results Race and ethnicity reporting on the death certificate continues to be excellent for the white and black populations. It remains poor for the American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) population but is reasonably good for the Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander (API) populations. Decedent characteristics such as placeof residence and nativity have an important effect on the quality of reporting on the death certificate. The effects of misclassification on mortality estimates were most pronounced for the AIAN population, where correcting for misclassification reverses a large AIAN over white mortality advantage toa large disadvantage. Among the Hispanic and API populations, adjustment for death certificate misclassification did not significantly affect minority-majority mortality differentials.","Death certificate; Death rates; Health disparities; Hispanic origin; Mortality; Racec","","","","","","","","Hambright Z., Marital status, race, nativity, and country of origin on the death certificate and matching census record, Vital Health Stat, 2, 34, (1969); Sorlie P.D., Rogot E., Johnson N.J., Validity of demographic characteristics on the death certificate, Epidemiology, 3, 2, pp. 181-184, (1992); Rosenberg H.M., Maurer J.D., Sorlie P.D., Johnson N.J., McDorman M.F., Hoyert D.L., Et al., Quality of death rates by race and Hispanic origin: A summary of current research, 1999, Vital Health Stat, 2, 128, (1999); Passel J.S., The growing American Indian population, 1960-1990: Beyond demography, Changing numbers, changing needs: American Indian demography and public health, pp. 79-102, (1996); Maurer J.D., Rosenberg H.M., Keemer J.B., Deaths of Hispanic origin, 15 reporting states, 1979-81, Vital Health Stat, 20, 18, (1990); Design and methodology, (2002); Mortality technical appendix, Vital statistics system; Race and ethnic standards for federal statistics and administrative reporting, Statistical policy directive, 15, (1977); Counting minorities: A brief history and a look at the future, Report on the American workforce, pp. 15-53, (2001); Tolson G.C., Barnes J.M., Gay G.A., Kowaleski J.L., The 1989 revision of the U.S. standard certificates and reports, Vital Health Stat, 4, 28, (1991); Hetzel A.M., U.S. Vital Statistics System, major activities and developments, 1950-95, (1997); Revisions to the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, (1997); National Longitudinal Mortality Study, 2007, (2007); Instruction manual, part 4: Demographic classification and coding instructions for death records, (1993); Vital statistics of the US, 2, (1979); Cresce A.R., Schmidley A.D., Ramirez R.R., Identification of Hispanic ethnicity in census 2000: Analysis of data quality for the question on Hispanic origin, (2004); del Pinal J., Schmidley D., Matched race and Hispanic origin responses from census 2000 and Current Population Survey February to May 2000, (2005); Ingram D.D., Parker J., Schenker N., Weed J., Hamilton B., Arias E., Et al., United States census 2000 population with bridged race categories, Vital Health Stat, 2, 135, (2003); Mulry M., Summary of accuracy and coverage evaluation for census 2000, (2006); 2000 Census of Population and Housing, (2001); Modified race data summary file, 2000 Census of Population and Housing, (2002); Logan J.R., Hispanic populations and their residential patterns in the metropolis, Lewis Mumford Center for Comparative Urban and Regional Research, (2002); Cresce A.R., Ramirez R.R., Analysis of general Hispanic responses in census 2000, (2003); Anderson R.N., Rosenberg H., Age standardization of death rates: Implementation of the year 2000 standard, National vital statistics reports, 47, 3, (1998); Preston S.H., Elo I.T., Stewart Q., Effects of age misreporting on mortality estimates at older ages, Popul Stud, 53, pp. 165-177, (1999); Palloni A., Arias E., Paradox lost: Explaining the Hispanic adult mortality advantage, Demography, 41, 3, pp. 385-415, (2004)","","","","","","","","","00832057","","","","English","Vital Health Stat.

Hlth., Baltimore, MD, United States","The crude birth rate in 2002 was 13.9 births per 1000 population, the lowest ever reported for the United States. The number of births, the crude birth rate, and the fertility rate (64.8) all declined slightly (by 1% or less) from 2001 to 2002. Fertility rates were highest for Hispanic women (94.0), followed by black (65.4), Asian or Pacific Islander (63.9), Native American (58.0), and non-Hispanic white women (57.5). Fertility rates declined slightly for all race/ethnic groups from 2001 to 2002. The birth rate for teen mothers continued to fall, dropping 5% from 2001 to 2002 to 42.9 births per 1000 women aged 15 to 19 years, another record low. The teen birth rate has fallen 31% since 1991; declines were more rapid for younger teens aged 15 to 17 (40%) than for older teens aged 18 to 19 (23%). The proportion of all births to unmarried women remained approximately the same at one third. Smoking during pregnancy continued to decline; smoking rates were highest among teen mothers. In 2002, 26.1% of births were delivered by cesarean section, up 7% since 2001 and 26% since 1996. The primary cesarean rate has risen 23% since 1996, whereas the rate of vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery has fallen 55%. The use of timely prenatal care increased slightly to 83.8% in 2002. From 1990 to 2002, the use of timely prenatal care increased by 6% (to 88.7%) for non-Hispanic white women, by 24% (to 75.2%) for black women, and by 28% (to 76.8%) for Hispanic women, thus narrowing racial disparities. The percentage of preterm births rose to 12.0% in 2002, from 10.6% in 1990 and 9.4% in 1981. Increases were largest for non-Hispanic white women. The percentage of low birth weight (LBW) births also increased to 7.8% in 2002, up from 6.7% in 1984. Twin and triplet/+ birth rates both increased by 3% from 2000 to 2001. Multiple births accounted for 3.2% of all births in 2001. The infant mortality rate (IMR) was 6.9 per 1000 live births (provisional data) in 2002 compared with 6.8 in 2001 (final data). The ratio of the IMR among black infants to that for white infants was 2.5 in 2001, the same as in 2000. Racial differences in infant mortality remain a major public health concern. The role of LBW in infant mortality remains a major issue. New Hampshire, Utah, and Massachusetts had the lowest IMRs. State-by-state differences in IMR reflect racial composition, the percentage of LBW, and birth weight-specific neonatal mortality rates for each state. The United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality. Expectation of life at birth reached a record high of 77.2 years for all sex and race groups combined in 2001. Death rates in the United States continue to decline. Between 2000 and 2001, death rates declined for the 3 leading causes of death: diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases. Death rates for children ages 1 to 19 years decreased for unintentional injuries by 3.3% in 2001; the death rate for chronic lower respiratory diseases decreased by 25% in 2001. Cancer and suicide levels did not change for children ages 1 to 19. A large proportion of childhood deaths continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.","Birth; Birth weight-specific mortality; Death; Infant mortality; Low birth weight; Mortality; Multiple births; Revised populations; Vital statistics","Adolescent; Adult; Birth Rate; Cause of Death; Censuses; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Pregnancy Rate; United States; adolescent pregnancy; Asian; birth rate; birth weight; cancer; Caucasian; cause of death; cerebrovascular disease; cesarean section; childhood injury; ethnic group; fertility; geographic distribution; heart disease; infant mortality; low birth weight; multiple pregnancy; Negro; prenatal care; priority journal; review; single parent; smoking; suicide; United States; vaginal delivery; vital statistics","","","","","","","MacDorman M.F., Minino A.M., Strobino D.M., Guyer B., Annual summary of vital statistics-2001, Pediatrics, 110, pp. 1037-1052, (2002); Martin J.A., Hamilton B.E., Ventura S.J., Menacker F., Park M.M., Sutton P.D., Births: Final data for 2001, Natl Vital Stat Rep, 51, pp. 1-102, (2002); Arias E., Anderson R.N., Kung H.C., Murphy S.L., Kochanek K.D., Deaths: Final data for 2001, Natl Vital Stat Rep, 52, pp. 1-116, (2003); Hamilton B.E., Martin J.A., Sutton P.D., Births: Preliminary data for 2002, Natl Vital Stat Rep, 51, pp. 1-20, (2003); Sutton P.D., Births, marriages, divorces, and deaths: Provisional data for October-December 2002, Natl Vital Stat Rep, 51, pp. 1-4, (2003); Vital Statistics of the United States, 2001, Volume I, Natality, Technical Appendix, 1, (2003); Manual of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, (1992); Anderson R.N., Smith B.L., Deaths: Leading causes for 2001, Natl Vital Stat Rep; Mathews T.J., Menacker F., MacDorman M.F., Infant mortality statistics from the 2001 period linked birth/infant death data set, Natl Vital Stat Rep, 52, pp. 1-28, (2003); Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity, (1997); Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting.

The tables presented are based on a newly revised methodology. For comparability, all life tables from the year 2000 forward have been re-estimated using the revised methodology and are presented in the ""Technical Notes"" section. METHODS: Data used to prepare the 2005 life tables are 2005 final mortality statistics, July 1, 2005 population estimates based on the 2000 decennial census, and 2005 Medicare data for ages 66-100. The methods used to estimate mortality for ages 0-65 were the same as those used in annual life tables from 1997 through 2004 (1). The methodology to estimate mortality for the population aged 66 and over was revised in three ways: Medicare data were used to supplement vital statistics and census data starting at age 66 rather than 85, as was done from 1997 through 2004; probabilities of death based on current Medicare data rather than rates of change of probabilities of death based on noncurrent Medicare data were used; and the smoothing and extrapolation of the probabilities of death for ages 66 and over were performed using a nonlinear least squares model rather than a linear model of the rate of change of the probabilities of death for ages 85 and over (1-3). RESULTS: In 2005, the overall expectation of life at birth was 77.4 years, representing a decline of 0.1 years from life expectancy in 2004. From 2004 to 2005, life expectancy at birth remained the same for males (74.9), females (79.9), the white population (77.9), white males (75.4), white females (80.4), the black population (72.8), and black males (69.3). Life expectancy at birth increased for black females (from 76.0 to 76.1). Life expectancy estimates based on the revised methodology are slightly lower than those based on the previous methodology. For 2005, life expectancy at birth based on the revised methodology was lower by 0.4 years for the total population.","","Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Sex Distribution; United States; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; African American; aged; article; Caucasian; child; ethnology; female; health survey; human; infant; life expectancy; life table; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; sex ratio; statistics; United States; ancestry group; epidemiology; statistics and numerical data; survival; trends; United States; very elderly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15518922","","","20578408","English","Natl Vital Stat Rep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955601866"

Method Data from the pooled 1997-2000 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) were used to develop models for bridging the Census 2000 multiple- race population to single-race categories. The bridging models included demographic and contextual covariates, some at the person-level and some at the county-level. Allocation probabilities were obtained from the regression models and applied to the Census Bureau's April 1, 2000, Modified Race Data Summary File population counts to assign multiple- race persons to single-race categories. Results Bridging has the most impact on the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) and Asian or Pacific Islander (API) populations, a small impact on the Black population and a negligible impact on the White population. For the United States as a whole, the AIAN, API, Black, and White bridged population counts are 12.0, 5.0, 2.5, and 0.5 percent higher than the corresponding Census 2000 single-race counts. At the subnational level, there is considerably more variation than observed at the national level. The bridged single-race population counts have been used to calculate birth and death rates produced by NCHS for 2000 and 2001 and to revise previously published rates for the 1990s, 2000, and 2001. The bridging methodology will be used to bridge postcensal population estimates for later years. The bridged population counts presented here and in subsequent years may be updated as additional data become available for use in the bridging process.","Bridging methods; Comparability; Logistic regression; Vital rates","","","","","","","","Revisions to the standards for the classification of Federal data on race and ethnicity, Federal Register 62FR58781-58790, (1997); Race and ethnic standards for Federal statistics and administrative reporting, Statistical Policy Directive, 15, (1977); Overview of race and Hispanic origin, Census 2000 Brief, (2001); Provisional guidance on the implementation of the 1997 standards for the collection of Federal data on race and ethnicity, (2000); Schenker N., Parker J.D., From single-race reporting to multiple-race reporting: Using imputation methods to bridge the transition, Stat Med, 22, pp. 1571-1587, (2003); Martin J.A., Hamilton B.E., Ventura S.J., Menacker F., Park M.M., Births: Final data for 2000, National vital statistics reports, 50, 5, (2002); Minino A.M., Arias E., Kochanek K.D., Murphy S.L., Smith B.L., Deaths: Final data for 2000, National vital statistics reports, 50, 15, (2002); Anderson R.N., Deaths: Leading causes for 2000, National vital statistics reports, 50, 16, (2002); Martin J.A., Hamilton B.E., Ventura S.J., Menacker F., Park M.M., Sutton P.D., Births: Final data for 2001, National vital statistics reports, 51, 2, (2002); Census 2000 Modified Race Data, (2002); United States resident population by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, (2003); United States resident population from the Vintage 2001 postcensal series by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau, (2003); United States resident population from the Vintage 2002 postcensal series by State, county, age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, prepared under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau, (2003); United States resident population by State, county, age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau with support from the National Cancer Institute, (2003); Parker J.D., Schenker N., Ingram D.D., Weed J.A., Heck K.E., Madans J.H., Bridging between two standards for collecting information on race and ethnicity and application to Census 2000 and vital rates, Public Health Reports; Ventura S.J., Hamilton B.E., Sutton P.D., Revised birth and fertility rates for the United States, 2000 and 2001, National vital statistics reports, 51, 4, (2003); Arias E., Anderson R.N., Kung H.C., Murphy S., Kochanek K.D., Deaths: Final data for 2001, National vital statistics reports, 52, (2003); Anderson R.N., Arias E., The effect of revised populations on mortality statistics for the United States, 2000, National vital statistics reports, 51, 9, (2003); Hamilton B.E., Sutton P.D., Ventura S.J., Revised birth and fertility rates for the 1990s and new rates for Hispanic populations, 2000 and 2001: United States, National vital statistics reports, 51, 12, (2003); Arias E., Smith B.L., Deaths: Preliminary data for 2001, National vital statistics reports, 51, 5, (2003); NHIS Survey questionnaires, flashcards, field representative manual, (1997); NHIS Survey questionnaires, flash cards, field representative manual, survey flowchart, (1998); NHIS Survey questionnaires, flash cards, field representative manual, survey flowchart, (1999); NHIS Survey questionnaires, flash cards, field representative manual, survey flowchart, (2000); Botman S.L., Moore T.F., Moriarity C.L., Parsons V.L., Design and estimation for the National Health Interview Survey, 1995-2004, Vital Health Stat, 2, 130, (2000); Eberhardt M.S., Ingram D.D., Makuc D.M., Et al., Urban and Rural Health Chartbook, (2001); Stata Statistical Software: Release 6.0, (1999); Arriaga E.E., Johnson P.D., Jamison E., Population analysis with microcomputers.

U.S. data on deaths are shown by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Death rates for 2001 are based on population estimates consistent with the April 1, 2000, census. Data on life expectancy, leading causes of death, infant mortality, and deaths resulting from September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks are also presented. For comparison, this report also presents revised final death rates for 2000, based on populations consistent with the April 1, 2000, census. METHODS: Data in this report are based on a large number of deaths comprising approximately 98 percent of the demographic file and 92 percent of the medical file for all deaths in the United States in 2001. The records are weighted to independent control counts of infant deaths and deaths 1 year and over received in State vital statistics offices for 2001. Unless otherwise indicated, comparisons are made with final data for 2000. For certain causes of death, preliminary data differ from final data because of the truncated nature of the preliminary file. These are, in particular, accidents, homicides, suicides, and respiratory diseases. Populations were produced for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau. The populations reflect the results of the 2000 census. This census allowed people to report more than one race for themselves and their household members and also separated the category for Asian or Pacific Islander persons into two groups (Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). These changes reflect the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) 1997 revisions to the standards for the classification of Federal data on race and ethnicity. Because only one race is currently reported in death certificate data, the 2000 census populations were ""bridged"" to the single race categories specified in OMB's 1977 guidelines for race and ethnic statistics in Federal reporting, which are still in use in the collection of vital statistics data. RESULTS: The age-adjusted death rate in 2001 for the United States decreased slightly from 869.0 deaths per 100,000 population in 2000 to 855.0 in 2001. For causes of death, declines in age-adjusted death rates occurred for Diseases of heart, Malignant neoplasms, Cerebrovascular diseases, Accidents (unintentional injuries), and Influenza and pneumonia. Age-adjusted death rates also declined for drug-induced deaths between 2000 and 2001. Age-adjusted death rates increased between 2000 and 2001 for the following causes: Alzheimer's disease, Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis, Essential (primary) hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, and Assault (homicide). The increase in homicide was a direct result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The infant mortality rate did not change between 2000 and 2001. Life expectancy at birth rose by 0.2 years to a record high of 77.2 years.","","Cause of Death; Continental Population Groups; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Male; Mortality; Terrorism; United States; article; cause of death; female; human; infant; infant mortality; life expectancy; male; mortality; newborn; race; statistics; terrorism; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15518922","","","12670054","English","Natl Vital Stat Rep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037436723"

Methods-Data used to prepare the 2008 life tables are 2008 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2008, population estimates based on the 2000 decennial census; and 2008 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The methodology used to estimate the 2008 life tables has been revised from that used for data years 2000-2007. The methodology was refined in two important ways. First, a logistic model rather than a nonlinear least squares model was used to smooth and extrapolate the vital statistics and Medicare blended death rates at the oldest ages. Second, the age at which smoothing is begun was raised from 66 to 85 or so, depending on the population. This modification applies to the life tables for the total population and for the white, black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black populations. The methodology used to estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 2006. Results-In 2008, the overall expectation of life at birth was 78.1 years. Between 2007 and 2008, life expectancy at birth increased for all groups considered, although approximately 0.1 years of the increase is due to the change in methodology. Life expectancy increased for both males (from 75.4 to 75.6) and females (80.4 to 80.6) and for the white population (78.4 to 78.5), the black population (73.6 to 74.0), the Hispanic population (80.9 to 81.0), the non-Hispanic white population (78.2 to 78.4), and the non-Hispanic black population (73.2 to 73.7).","Death rates; Life expectancy; Race; Survival","Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Sex Distribution; Survival Analysis; United States; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; African American; age distribution; aged; article; Caucasian; child; ethnology; female; Hispanic; human; infant; life expectancy; life table; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; sex ratio; statistics; survival; United States; very elderly; young adult","","","","","","","Shryock H.S., Siegel J.S., Larmon E.A., The methods and materials of demography, 2, (1971); Moriyama I.M., Gustavus S.O., Cohort mortality and survivorship, United States death-registration states, 1900-1968.

Methods The methods used to estimate the probability of death for ages 0-80 for the Hispanic population and 0-65 for the non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations are the same as those used in annual U.S. life tables since 1997, with an important modification. Age-specific death rates are first corrected for racial and ethnic misclassification on U.S. death certificates. To address the effects of age misstatement at the oldest ages, the methodology used to estimate mortality for ages 66 and over for the non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations is the same as that used to estimate the annual life tables since 2005. For the Hispanic population, the probability of death for ages over 80 is estimated as a function of non-Hispanic white mortality with the use of the Brass relational logit model. Results Life expectancy at birth for the total population in 2006 was 77.7 years; 80.6 years for the Hispanic population, 78.1 years for the non-Hispanic white population, and 72.9 years for the non-Hispanic black population. The Hispanic population has a life expectancy advantage at birth of 2.5 years over the non-Hispanic white population and 7.7 years over the non-Hispanic black population. Although seemingly paradoxical, these results are consistent with the findings of numerous studies which show a Hispanic mortality advantage despite this population's lower socioeconomic status. Nonetheless, the procedures used in this report to correct for racial and ethnic misclassification and age misstatement are not error free and therefore some of the observed advantage may still be a function of data artifact. This report does not address other factors that may explain the Hispanic mortality advantage.","Death rates; Hispanic origin; Race; Survival","","","","","","","","Rosenberg H.M., Maurer J.D., Sorlie P.D., Et al., Quality of death rates by race and Hispanic origin: A summary of current research, 1999, Vital Health Stat, 2, 128, (1999); Arias E., Schauman W.S., Eschbach K., Et al., The validity of race and Hispanic origin reporting on death certificates in the United States, Vital Health Stat, 2, 148, (2008); Arias E., Eschbach K., Schauman W.S., Backlund E.L., Sorlie P.D., The Hispanic mortality advantage and ethnic misclassification on US death certificates, Am J Public Health, 100, 1 S, (2010); Preston S.H., Elo I.T., Stewart Q., Effects of age misreporting on mortality estimates at older ages, Popul Stud, 53, 2, pp. 165-177, (1999); Anderson R.N., Method for constructing complete annual U.S. life tables, Vital Health Stat, 2, 129, (1999); Revisions to the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, (1997); Sorlie P.D., Rogot E., Johnson N.J., Validity of demographic characteristics on the death certificate, Epidemiology, 3, 2, pp. 181-184, (1992); Dechter A., Preston S.H., Age misreporting and its effects on adult mortality estimates in Latin America, Popul Bull UN, 31-32, pp. 1-16, (1991); Bell F.C., Miller M.L., Life tables for the United States social security area 1900-2100, (2005); Introduction to the use of Medicare data for research, (2004); Race and ethnic data in Social Security Administration (SSA) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) records; Mortality technical appendix, Vital Statistics System; Ingram D.D., Parker J.D., Schenker N., Et al., United States Census 2000 population with bridged race categories, Vital Health Stat, 2, 135, (2003); Race and ethnic standards for federal statistics and administrative reporting, Statistical policy directive, 15, (1977); Heron M.P., Hoyert D.L., Murphy S.L., Et al., Deaths: Final data for 2006, National vital statistics reports, 57, 14, (2009); Mathews T.J., McDorman M.F., Infant mortality statistics from the 2005 period linked birth/infant death data set, National vital statistics reports, 57, 2, (2008); Mathews T.J., McDorman M.F., Infant mortality statistics from the 2006 period linked birth/infant death data set, National vital statistics reports, 58, 17, (2010); Shryock H.S., Siegel J.S., Et al., The methods and materials of demography, 2, (1971); Wei R., Curtin L.R., Arias E., Anderson R.N., United States decennial life tables for 1999-2001, methodology of the United States life tables, National vital statistics reports, 57, 4, (2008); Arias E., Rostron B.L., Tejada-Vera B., United States life tables, 2005, National vital statistics reports, 58, 10, (2010); Elo I.T., Turra C.M., Kestenbaum B., Fergusson B.R., Mortality among elderly Hispanics in the United States: Past evidence and new results, Demography, 41, 1, pp. 109-128, (2004); Turra C.M., Elo I.T., The impact of salmon bias on the Hispanic mortality advantage: New evidence from social security data, Popul Res Policy Rev, 27, 5, pp. 515-530, (2008); Brass W., On the scale of mortality, Biological aspects of demography, (1971); Himes C.L., Preston S.H., Condran G.A., A relational model of mortality at older ages in low mortality countries, Popul Stud, 48, pp. 269-291, (1994); Preston S.H., Elo I.T., Black mortality at very old ages in official US life tables: A skeptical appraisal, Popul Dev Rev, 32, 3, pp. 557-565, (2006); Preston S.H., Heuveline P., Guillot M., Demography measuring and modeling population processes, (2001); Arias E., United States life tables, 2006, National vital statistics reports, 58, 21, (2010); Palloni A., Arias E., Paradox lost: Explaining the Hispanic adult mortality advantage, Demography, 41, 3, pp. 385-415, (2004); Markides K.S., Coreil J., The health of Hispanics in the southwestern United States: An epidemiologic paradox, Public Health Rep, 101, 3, pp. 253-265, (1986); Sorlie P.D., Backlund E., Johnson N.J., Rogot E., Mortality by Hispanic status in the United States, JAMA, 270, 20, pp. 2464-2468, (1993); Eschbach K., Kuo Y.F., Goodwin J.S., Ascertainment of Hispanic ethnicity on California death certificates: Implications for the explanation of the Hispanic mortality advantage, Am J Public Health, 96, 12, pp. 2209-2215, (2006); Hummer R.A., Powers D.A., Pullum S.G., Gossman G.L., Frisbie W.P., Paradox found (again): Infant mortality among the Mexican-origin population in the United States, Demography, 44, 3, pp. 441-457, (2007)","","","","","","","","","00832057","","","","English","Vital Health Stat.

Methods—Information reported on death certificates is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Beginning in 2018, all states and the District of Columbia were using the 2003 revised certificate of death for the entire year, which includes the 1997 Office of Management and Budget revised standards for race. Data based on these revised standards are not completely comparable to previous years. Results—In 2020, a total of 3,383,729 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 835.4 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, an increase of 16.8% from the 2019 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 77.0 years, a decrease of 1.8 years from 2019. Age-specific death rates increased from 2019 to 2020 for age groups 15 years and over and decreased for age group under 1 year. Many of the 15 leading causes of death in 2020 changed from 2019. COVID-19, a new cause of death in 2020, became the third leading cause in 2020. The infant mortality rate decreased 2.9% to a historic low of 5.42 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2020. Conclusions—In 2020, the age-adjusted death rate increased and life expectancy at birth decreased for the total, male, and female populations, primarily due to the influence of deaths from COVID-19. © 2023, National Center for Health Statistics.

Trends and patterns in general mortality, life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality are also described. A previous report presented preliminary mortality data for 2000. METHODS: In 2000 a total of 2,403,351 deaths were reported in the United States. This report presents descriptive tabulations of information reported on the death certificates. Funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners complete death certificates. Original records are filed in the State registration offices. Statistical information is compiled into a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Causes of death are processed in accordance with the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). RESULTS: The age-adjusted death rate for the United States in 2000 was 872.0 deaths per 100,000 standard population, a decrease of 1.1 percent from the 1999 rate and a record-low historical figure. Life expectancy at birth rose by 0.2 year to a record high of 76.9 years. Considering all deaths, age-specific death rates rose only for those 45-54 years and declined for a number of age groups including those 1-4 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, and 85 years and over. Fourteen of the 15 leading causes of death are the same for 1999 and 2000. Heart disease and cancer continued to be the leading and second leading causes of death, accounting for over one-half of all deaths when combined. Aortic aneurysm, which was the 15th leading cause of death in 1999, dropped from the list in 2000 and, in its place, Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids is the 15th leading cause of death. The infant mortality rate reached a record low value of 6.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, declining 2.8 percent from the infant mortality rate in 1999 (7.1 deaths per 1,000 live births). CONCLUSIONS: Generally, mortality continued long-term trends. The slight increase in the age-adjusted death rate that was experienced in 1999 reversed itself in accordance to a longer standing decreasing pattern. Life expectancy increased 0.2 years, and the infant mortality rate decreased statistically to a record low 6.9 deaths per 1,000 live births, thus maintaining the steady decline that has characterized it for the past four decades.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Continental Population Groups; Disease; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Male; Marital Status; Middle Aged; Mortality; United States; adolescent; adult; aged; article; cause of death; child; classification; comparative study; educational status; female; general aspects of disease; human; infant; life expectancy; male; marriage; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; race; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15518922","","","12382630","English","Natl Vital Stat Rep","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037119923"

Methods—Data used to prepare the 2021 life tables are 2021 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2021, population estimates based on the Blended Base population estimates produced by the U.S. Census Bureau; and 2021 Medicare data for people ages 66-99. The methodology used to estimate life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 2006. The same methodology is used to estimate life tables for the American Indian and Alaska Native non-Hispanic and Asian non-Hispanic populations. The methodology used to estimate the 2021 life tables for all other groups was first implemented with data year 2008. Results—In 2021, the overall expectation of life at birth was 76.4 years, decreasing 0.6 year from 77.0 in 2020. From 2020 to 2021, life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.7 year for males (from 74.2 to 73.5) and by 0.6 year for females (79.9 to 79.3). Between 2020 and 2021, life expectancy decreased by 1.5 years for the American Indian and Alaska Native non-Hispanic population (67.1 to 65.6), 0.7 year for the White non-Hispanic population (77.4 to 76.7), 0.3 year for the Black non-Hispanic population (71.5 to 71.2), 0.1 year for the Hispanic population (77.9 to 77.8), and 0.1 year for the Asian non-Hispanic population (83.6 to 83.5). © 2023, National Center for Health Statistics.

The data available to us do not support the idea that the breakup of the traditional family, the advent of massive rural-urban migratory flows, and the disruptions produced by rapid urbanization and industrialization leads inevitably to increases in female headship. Female headship does increase by a small amount in three countries but declines or remains invariant everywhere else. We find remarkable similarities across countries in the age-patterns of female headship as well as in the compositional factors accounting for it, namely, marital status, education, poverty and urban-rural residence.","","article; family study; female; household; human; industrialization; marriage; migration; poverty; prevalence; sex role; South and Central America; urbanization","","","","","","","Arias E., Lizabeth and Susan De Vos.; Bennett N., Eil G., David E.

Methods—Data used to prepare these life tables include population data by age on the census date April 1, 2010; deaths occurring in the 3-year period 2009–2011 classified by age at death; births for each of the years 2007–2011; and Medicare data for ages 66–99 for the 3 years 2009–2011. The methods used differ from those applied to the 1999–2001 decennial life tables in the estimation of mortality for ages 66 and over. For the total, white, black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black populations, the method developed for the U.S. annual life tables beginning with data year 2008 was used. It consists of the application of the Kannisto logistic model to smooth death rates in the age range 85–99 and predict death rates for ages 100–120 (2,3). For the Hispanic population, which is added to the decennial series for the first time with the 2009–2011 set, the method developed for the U.S. annual life tables beginning with data year 2006 was used. This method consists of using the Brass relational logit model to estimate mortality for ages 80–120 (4). © 2020, National Center for Health Statistics.

Methods The methodology used to calculate the U.S. censustract abridged life tables consisted of several stages. First, through a collaboration between the National Vital Statistics System registration areas and the National Center for Health Statistics, death records of U.S. residents (excluding residents of Maine and Wisconsin) for deaths occurring in 2010 through 2015 were geocoded using decedents’ residential addresses to identify and code census tracts. Second, population estimates were produced based on the 2010 decennial census and the 2011–2015 American Community Survey 5-year survey. Third, a methodology that combined standard demographic techniques and statistical modeling was developed to address challenges posed by small population sizes and small and missing age-specific death counts. Last, standard, abridged life table methods were adjusted to account for error introduced by population estimates based on sample data. Results Statistically reliable, abridged, period life tables were produced for 88.7% of U.S. census tracts (65,662). A battery of tests revealed that the census-tract life table functions followed expected patterns; their distribution about state and U.S. values showed no aberrations; and their weighted mean values compared well with state- and national-level estimates. The weighted mean life expectancy at birth for the 65,662 census tracts was 78.7 years compared with the official U.S. estimate of 78.8 years in midyear 2013. The results of this study concur with previous research showing that a minimum population size of 5,000 is acceptable, with the caveat that missing age-specific death counts cannot be ignored. The methodology developed for this study addressed the issues of small populations and zero deaths as robustly as possible, although it is not without error. © 2018, National Center for Health Statistics.

These tables are the most recent in a 110-year series of decennial life tables for the United States. Methods—This report presents complete life tables for the United States by race, Hispanic origin, and sex, based on age-specific death rates during 2009–2011. This is the first set of life tables by Hispanic origin presented in the U.S. decennial life table series. Data used to prepare these life tables include population estimates based on the 2010 decennial census; deaths occurring in the United States to U.S. residents in the 3 years 2009 through 2011; counts of U.S. resident births in the years 2007 through 2011; and population and death counts from the Medicare program for years 2009 through 2011. The methodology used to estimate life tables for the Hispanic population is based on the method first implemented with the 2006 annual U.S. life tables by Hispanic origin. The methodology used to estimate the life tables for all other groups is based on the method first implemented with the 2008 annual U.S. life tables. Results—During 2009–2011, life expectancy at birth was 78.60 years for the total U.S. population, representing an increase of 29.36 years from a life expectancy of 49.24 years in 1900. Between 1900 and 2010, life expectancy increased by 42.88 years for black females (from 35.04 to 77.92), by 39.21 years for black males (from 32.54 to 71.75), by 30.15 years for white females (from 51.08 to 81.23), and by 28.26 years for white males (from 48.23 to 76.49). During 2009–2011, Hispanic females had the highest life expectancy at birth (84.05), followed by non-Hispanic white females (81.06), Hispanic males (78.83), non-Hispanic black females (77.62), non-Hispanic white males (76.30), and non-Hispanic black males (71.41). © 2020, National Center for Health Statistics.
