This effect holds robust after controlling for city characteristics. Cities with higher bank concentration have less entrepreneurship and labor income. We use China's 2009 bank deregulation as a quasi-natural experiment, and find that the shock leads to significant increases in population growth for cities with new entry of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks. We argue the deregulation increases credit supply, which relieves local households' financial constraints and improves population growth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Bank concentration; China; Household finance; Population growth","","","","","","Xiamen University, XMU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72233002, 72102202, 72302086); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2023JJ40184); Changsha City Natural Science Foundation of China, (kq2208046)","We thank valuable comments from the discussant from conference sponsored by PBFJ with the special issue \u201CSustainability in the Economic System and Capital Markets, Contemporary Topics on Market Developments and Policy Reforms\u201D, and the seminar participants at Xiamen University.

We examined how macro-level social factors such as cultural norms and unbalanced regional economic development shaped older people's network behaviors, and whether these factors could moderate the association between network types and mortality. Using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (2008–2014), we identified four network types—diverse, friend-focused, family-focused, and restricted—based on individuals’ social network measures. Multinomial logistic analyses revealed that older people situated in an area with a deeply rooted family culture or a more advanced economy tend to be less likely to enroll in a diverse network than a family-focused one. This prevents them from achieving the best adaptive survival, as Cox regression analyses showed that the family-focused network type was less beneficial than the diverse one for the survival of older adults. Furthermore, while the survival advantage of the diverse-network type over the family-focused type did not change with cultural contexts, economic development attenuated the deleterious effects of the friend-focused network type. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Culture; Economic development; Mortality; Network type; Social relationships","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; China; Cultural Characteristics; Economic Development; Family; Female; Friends; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Social Support; China; cultural influence; economic development; elderly population; mortality; psychology; regional economy; social behavior; social network; aged; article; China; economic development; friend; human; longevity; mortality; proportional hazards model; social aspect; social interaction; social network; China; cultural factor; economic development; epidemiology; family; female; human relation; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; mortality; psychology; social support; statistics and numerical data; trends; very elderly","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71490731); Renmin University of China, RUC, (14XNK014); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by both the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (grant number: 14XNK014 ) and the National Nature Science Foundation of China (grant number: 71490731 ).","Adams G., Plaut V.C., The cultural grounding of personal relationship: friendship in North American and West African worlds, Pers.

The associations between residing with a daughter and the provision of intergenerational support varied between urban- and rural-dwelling older adults.

Analyses show that households' social network size and network composition affect their choices by limiting the quality and quantity of information, resources, and social influence one can access through social ties. Moreover, we find that high-SES families favor formal intermediaries due not only to their richer financial knowledge, higher affordability, and greater capacity to repay loans, but also to their high demands and special types of financial needs that can hardly be satisfied by embedded resources. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Financial intermediary;

This study assessed the associations between social network ties and multiple measures of inflammation in a nationally representative sample of adults with a history of cancer (N = 1,075) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-94). Individuals with lower social network index (SNI) scores showed significantly greater inflammation marked by C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, adjusting for age and sex. Compared to fully socially integrated individuals (SNI = 4), those who were more socially isolated or had a SNI score of 3 or less exhibited increasingly elevated inflammation burdens. Specifically, the age-and sex-adjusted odds ratios (95%CI) for SNIs of 3, 2, and 0-1 were 1.49 (1.08, 2.06), 1.69 (1.21, 2.36), and 2.35 (1.62, 3.40), respectively (p <.001). Adjusting for other covariates attenuated these associations. The SNI gradients in the risks of inflammation were particularly salient for the lower socioeconomic status groups and remained significant after adjusting for other social, health behavioral, and illness factors. This study provided initial insights into the immunological pathways by which social connections are related to morbidity and mortality outcomes of cancer in particular and aging-related diseases in general. © 2014 Society for Biodemography and Social Biology.","","C-Reactive Protein; Female; Fibrinogen; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Nutrition Surveys; Risk Factors; Serum Albumin; Social Isolation; Social Support; United States; C reactive protein; fibrinogen; serum albumin; complication; female; human; inflammation; male; middle aged; Neoplasms; nutrition; psychology; risk factor; social isolation; social support; United States","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; fibrinogen, 9001-32-5; serum albumin, 9048-46-8; C-Reactive Protein, ; Fibrinogen, ; Serum Albumin, ","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD050924)","This study was supported by grant #K01AG036745 from the National Institute of Aging (awarded to the first author) and University Cancer Research Funds at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (awarded to all authors).

We find that civic networks of women and whites exhibit greater network centrality than their counterparts do. Religious organizations are the hub of civic networks, while labor unions and ethnic/civil-rights organizations are more peripheral. Whites tend to have job-related and nondomestic organizations as the core of their civic network. Women rely on domestic organizations and show little advantage over men in overlapping memberships of voluntary associations. These findings provide a more holistic view of racial and gender disparities in social networks. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences","demographic disparity; network centrality; Social network analysis; voluntary participation","Regression analysis; Social networking (online); Civic networks; Demographic disparity; Gender disparity; Labor unions; Method model; Network centralities; Network methods; Regression modelling; Social Network Analysis; Voluntary participation; Population statistics","","","","","Lincoln Institute of Land Policy","2020 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Franklin St., United States","Background: Metabolic functions may operate as important biophysiological mechanisms through which social relationships affect health. It is unclear how social embeddedness or the lack thereof is related to risk of metabolic dysregulation. To fill this gap we tested the effects of social integration on metabolic functions over time in a nationally representative sample of older adults in the United States and examined population heterogeneity in the effects. Methods. Using longitudinal data from 4,323 adults aged over 50 years in the Health and Retirement Study and latent growth curve models, we estimated the trajectories of social integration spanning five waves, 1998-2006, in relation to biomarkers of energy metabolism in 2006. We assessed social integration using a summary index of the number of social ties across five domains. We examined six biomarkers, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the summary index of the overall burden of metabolic dysregulation. Results: High social integration predicted significantly lower risks of both individual and overall metabolic dysregulation. Specifically, adjusting for age, sex, race, and body mass index, having four to five social ties reduced the risks of abdominal obesity by 61% (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 0.39 [0.23, 0.67], p =.007), hypertension by 41% (OR [95% CI] = 0.59 [0.42, 0.84], p =.021), and the overall metabolic dysregulation by 46% (OR [95% CI] = 0.54 [0.40, 0.72], p <.001). The OR for the overall burden remained significant when adjusting for social, behavioral, and illness factors. In addition, stably high social integration had more potent metabolic impacts over time than changes therein. Such effects were consistent across subpopulations and more salient for the younger old (those under age 65), males, whites, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Conclusions: This study addressed important challenges in previous research linking social integration to metabolic health by clarifying the nature and direction of the relationship as it applies to different objectively measured markers and population subgroups. It suggests additional psychosocial and biological pathways to consider in future research on the contributions of social deficits to disease etiology and old-age mortality. © 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Blood pressure; Glycosylated hemoglobin; High-density lipoprotein cholesterol; Metabolic functions; Older adults; Social integration; Social network size; Total cholesterol; Waist circumference","Aged; Biological Markers; Blood Pressure; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, HDL; Energy Metabolism; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; United States; Waist Circumference; biological marker; cholesterol; glycosylated hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; aged; article; blood; blood pressure; energy metabolism; female; human; human relation; longitudinal study; male; metabolic disorder; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; psychological aspect; risk assessment; risk factor; United States; waist circumference","","cholesterol, 57-88-5; glycosylated hemoglobin, 9062-63-9","","","National Institute on Aging; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (K01AG036745); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD050924)","We thank Kenneth Bollen for advice on the latent growth curve model specification used in the analysis and Kathleen Mullan Harris for various substantive comments related to the biomarker data in population-based studies.

However, the existing discoveries are still inconsistent, which may be attributed largely to the heterogeneous measures and methods scholars used and to the unidirectional causalities presumed in most research. This study addresses these gaps by using more-refined measures to explore whether the network types have differential impacts on older adults' health outcomes, and whether a reverse causal relationship exists between older adults' health conditions and the network types they adopted. Using data from three recent waves (2005, 2008, and 2012) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (n=4190), we constructed four network types using the K-means clustering method (i.e., diverse, friend, family, and restricted), and examined their impacts on a variety of health outcomes (i.e., physical, cognitive, psychological, and overall well-being). Our results demonstrate that there are strong reciprocal associations between these two factors. On the one hand, a diverse network type yielded the most beneficial health outcomes as measured by multiple health indicators, and the friend-focused network type is more beneficial than the family-focused network type in physical outcomes but not in psychological outcomes. On the other hand, we found that a decrease in all health indicators leads to withdrawal from more-beneficial network types such as a diversified network type, and a shift to less-beneficial network types such as family-focused or restricted networks. The understanding of this reciprocal association could encourage programs designed to enhance healthy aging to focus on improving the bridging social capital of older adults so that they can break the vicious cycle between network isolation and poor health conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autoregressive cross-lagged model; China; K-means clustering; Older population's health; Social networks","Activities of Daily Living; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; China; Family; Female; Friends; Health Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Residence Characteristics; Sex Factors; Social Isolation; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; China; cluster analysis; elderly population; public health; regression analysis; social capital; social network; adult; aged; aging; Article; Chinese; cognition; controlled study; family; female; friend; health status; human; longitudinal study; male; neighborhood; psychological well being; social behavior; social capital; social isolation; social network; social support; wellbeing; age; aging; China; daily life activity; demography; family; friend; health behavior; human relation; mental health; middle aged; sex difference; social support; socioeconomics; very elderly","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Renmin University of China, RUC; Project 985; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (14CRK007)","This study is supported by funding from the 985 Project which was granted to Renmin University of China by the Ministry of Education of China .

In addition, depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents have risen sharply in the last decade, and among these adolescents, boys in rural areas are most likely to be depressed. OBJECTIVE In this study, we investigate the phenomenon of depression in a large number of rural boys. We hypothesize that upon perceiving the strong competition in the local marriage market, rural parents tend to increase educational investment to improve their sons’ relative standing in the market, thereby leading to high pressure and depression among rural boys. METHODS By leveraging variations across counties and cohorts, we constructed a difference-in-differences model featuring rich fixed effects to absorb invariant confounding factors and cohort trends across provinces. To ensure the exogeneity of sex ratios, we studied the first children in families, in cognition of the randomness of the first child’s gender. CONCLUSIONS Empirical evidence suggests that high sex ratios motivate rural parents to elevate their educational expectations of and tangible and intangible investments in their sons, invariably increasing performance pressure and lowering academic performance, thereby deepening mental depression. CONTRIBUTION Our study contributes to multidisciplinary theories, such as son preference, competitive motive, and tiger parenting theory. Moreover, our findings have relevant implications: (1) A population control policy combined with a son-preference culture induces several unanticipated negative consequences. (2) The unrestrained educational investment is in disagreement with human capital outcomes. © 2022 Hantao Wu & Ting Li.","","","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (20BRK043)","This research received funding from the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant 20BRK043).","Almond D., Li H., Meng L., Son preference and early childhood investments in China, (2010); Banister J., China’s changing population, (1987); Baumrind D., Effects of authoritative parental control on child behavior, Child Development, 37, 4, pp. 887-907, (1966); Baumrind D., Differentiating between confrontive and coercive kinds of parental power-assertive disciplinary practices, Human Development, 55, pp. 35-51, (2012); Bertrand M., Duflo E., Mullainathan S., How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119, 1, pp. 249-275, (2004); Cai Y., Feng W., Famine, social disruption, and involuntary fetal loss: evidence from Chinese survey data, Demography, 42, 2, pp. 301-322, (2005); Chua A., Battle hymn of the tiger mother, (2011); Coale A.J., Excess female mortality and the balance of the sexes in the population: an estimate of the number of “missing females”, The Population and Development Review, 17, 3, pp. 517-523, (1991); Coale A.J., Banister J., Five decades of missing females in China, Demography, 31, 3, pp. 459-479, (1994); Davin D., Marriage migration in China and East Asia, Journal of Contemporary China, 16, 50, pp. 83-95, (2007); Du Q., Wei S.-J., A theory of the competitive saving motive, Journal of International Economics, 91, 2, pp. 275-289, (2013); Ebenstein A., The “missing girls” of China and the unintended consequences of the one child policy, Journal of Human Resources, 45, 1, pp. 87-115, (2010); Ebenstein A., Estimating a dynamic model of sex selection in China, Demography, 48, 2, pp. 783-811, (2011); Ebenstein A., Leung S., Son preference and access to social insurance: evidence from China’s rural pension program, Population and Development Review, 36, 1, pp. 47-70, (2010); Edlund L., Son preference, sex ratios, and marriage patterns, Journal of Political Economy, 107, 6, pp. 1275-1304, (1999); Gong J., Lu Y., Song H., The effect of teacher gender on students’ academic and noncognitive outcomes, Journal of Labor Economics, 36, 3, pp. 743-778, (2018); Greenhalgh S., Patriarchal demographics?

Existing literature has demonstrated significant associations between various factors and household structure, but the spatial variation in these relationships has not been examined. Using the 2010 Chinese population census data and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, this study explored the spatial patterns of three-generation lineal households, a functionally important household type in China, and its influencing factors. There was significant heterogeneity in the distribution of three-generation lineal households. Socioeconomic, demographic, and cultural factors were all significantly related to the proportion of three-generation lineal households, but the relationships are place-specific in terms of direction and magnitude. These results suggest that the distribution of Chinese household structures cannot be explained by a single framework of family modernization theory but is determined by the interplay of various local characteristics. Especially, population migration plays an equally important role in affecting household structure than socioeconomic development in China. This work contributes to the family literature by highlighting the spatial heterogeneity in the impact of varying factors on household structure. Beyond the classic modernization theory, it sets a contextualized framework for understanding how Chinese household change in response to the rapid social transformation. © 2022, Science in China Press.","China; geographically weighted regression; household structure; migration; three-generation lineal household","","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (20BRK043)","National Social Science Foundation of China, No.20BRK043","Aykan H., Wolf D.A., Traditionality, modernity, and household composition: Parent-child coresidence in contemporary Turkey, Research on Aging, 22, 4, pp. 395-421, (2000); Bongaarts J., Zimmer Z., Living arrangements of older adults in the developing world: An analysis of demographic and health survey household surveys, The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 57, 3, pp. S145-S157, (2002); Brunsdon C., Fotheringham A.S., Charlton M.E., Geographically weighted regression: A method for exploring spatial nonstationarity, Geographical Analysis, 28, 4, pp. 281-298, (1996); Curtis M.A., The impact of housing subsidies and prices on mothers’ living arrangements: Evidence from the census, Housing Studies, 26, 5, pp. 747-765, (2011); De Vos S., Extended family living among older people in six Latin American countries, Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 45, pp. 87-94, (1990); Engels F., The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, (2007); Ermisch J., Prices, parents, and young people’s household formation, Journal of Urban Economics, 45, 1, pp. 47-71, (1999); Fei X., The problem of old-age care in the change of family structure: On the change of family structure in China, Journal of Peking University (Philosophy and Social Sciences), 3, pp. 7-16, (1983); Goode W.J., World Revolution and Family Patterns, (1963); Hajnal J., Two kinds of preindustrial household formation system, Population and Development Review, 8, 3, pp. 449-494, (1982); Hareven T.K., Modernization and family history: Perspectives on social change, Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 2, 1, pp. 190-206, (1976); Hareven T.K., Reflections on family research in the People’s Republic of China, Social Research, 54, 4, pp. 663-689, (1987); Hu Z., Peng X., Household changes in contemporary China: An analysis based on census data, Sociological Studies, 3, pp. 145-166, (2014); Huang Z., Modern Chinese family: Perspective from economic and legal history, Open Times, 5, pp. 82-105, (2011); Jacka T., Kipnis A.B., Sargeson S., Contemporary China: Society and Social Change, (2013); Jiang L., O'Neill B.C., Impacts of demographic trends on US household size and structure, Population and Development Review, 33, 3, pp. 567-591, (2007); Li T., Fan W., Song J., The household structure transition in China: 1982–2015, Demography, 57, 4, pp. 1369-1391, (2020); Logan J.R., Bian F., Family values and coresidence with married children in urban China, Social Forces, 77, 4, pp. 1253-1282, (1999); Nakaya T., GWR4.09 user manual, (2016); Nimkoff M.F., Changing family relationships of older people in the United States during the last fifty years, Gerontologist, 1, 2, pp. 92-97, (1961); Parsons T., The social structure of the family, The Family: Its Function and Destiny, (1949); Ruggles S., The transformation of American family structure, American Historical Review, 99, 1, pp. 103-128, (1994); Ruggles S., Heggeness M., Intergenerational coresidence in developing countries, Population and Development Review, 34, 2, pp. 253-281, (2008); Shi Q., Dorling D., Growing socio-spatial inequality in neo-liberal times?

Drawing on data from four nationally representative longitudinal samples of the US population, we implemented an innovative life course design to assess the prospective association of both structural and functional dimensions of social relationships (social integration, social support, and social strain) with objectively measured biomarkers of physical health (C-reactive protein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass index) within each life stage, including adolescence and young, middle, and late adulthood, and compare such associations across life stages. We found that a higher degree of social integration was associated with lower risk of physiological dysregulation in a dose-response manner in both early and later life. Conversely, lack of social connections was associated with vastly elevated risk in specific life stages. For example, social isolation increased the risk of inflammation by the same magnitude as physical inactivity in adolescence, and the effect of social isolation on hypertension exceeded that of clinical risk factors such as diabetes in old age. Analyses of multiple dimensions of social relationships within multiple samples across the life course produced consistent and robust associations with health. Physiological impacts of structural and functional dimensions of social relationships emerge uniquely in adolescence and midlife and persist into old age.","Biomarker; Life course; Longevity; Physiological dysregulation; Social relationships","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Health; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longevity; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Odds Ratio; Social Support; Young Adult; biological marker; C reactive protein; biological marker; abdominal obesity; adolescence; adulthood; Article; body mass; chronic disease; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; educational status; high risk behavior; human; hypertension; income; inflammation; integration; lifespan; longevity; obesity; physical activity; physical inactivity; physiology; priority journal; smoking; social interaction; social isolation; social status; social strain; social support; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; adolescent; adult; aged; biological model; health; human relation; longevity; metabolism; middle aged; odds ratio; young adult","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; Biomarkers, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (K01 AG036745); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P01HD031921); Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CPC, (R24 HD050924, T32 HD007168)","We are grateful to our colleagues Jenny Tung, Jim House, Jason Lieb, Martha McClintock, Linda Waite, Philip Morgan, and Michael Shanahan for helpful suggestions and comments.

Drawing on hallmarks of aging, we link these concepts to candidate biological mechanisms through a framework that defines death as challenges to vitality where distal factors defined the age-evolution of vitality and proximal factors define the probability distribution of challenges. To illustrate the process POV, we hypothesize that the immune system is a mortality nexus, characterized by two vitality streams: increasing vitality representing immune system development and immunosenescence representing vitality dissipation. Proximal challenges define three mortality partitions: juvenile and adult extrinsic mortalities and intrinsic adult mortality. Model parameters, generated from Swedish mortality data (1751–2010), exhibit biologically meaningful correspondences to economic, health and cause-of-death patterns. The model characterizes the twentieth century epidemiological transition mainly as a reduction in extrinsic mortality resulting from a shift from high magnitude disease challenges on individuals at all vitality levels to low magnitude stress challenges on low vitality individuals. Of secondary importance, intrinsic mortality was described by a gradual reduction in the rate of loss of vitality presumably resulting from reduction in the rate of immunosenescence. Extensions and limitations of a distal/proximal framework for characterizing more explicit causes of death, e.g. the young adult mortality hump or cancer in old age are discussed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adult and juvenile mortality; Cause-of-death; Extrinsic/intrinsic mortality; Hallmarks of aging; Immune system; Mortality model; Swedish mortality data; Vitality","Age Distribution; Animals; Cause of Death; Computer Simulation; Death; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunosenescence; Models, Immunological; Models, Statistical; Morals; Sweden; Article; autophagy; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; cell aging; chronic inflammation; cytomegalovirus infection; diet restriction; functional status; genomic instability; homeostasis; human; immune system; immunosenescence; infection; life extension; malignant neoplasm; malnutrition; mortality; mortality rate; nonhuman; stem cell; survival; Sweden; age distribution; animal; biological model; computer simulation; death; epidemiology; immunology; innate immunity; morality; statistical model","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R21AG046760)","This research was supported by National Institute of Health Grant R21AG046760.

An early core mission of finding regularities underlying macro-level population phenomena and a later interest in explaining population changes inductively facilitated the development of formal demographic techniques. A more radical methodological shift occurred after the 1960s, with the increasing availability of micro-level survey data and a shift of theoretical focus toward causal mechanisms, leading to the widespread adoption of regression-based models and methods from other social science disciplines. The future development of demographic methods will likely continue to incorporate new methods first developed in other disciplines, including techniques for analyzing unstructured “big” data, but formal demographic techniques will still play a role in population forecasting, measurements improvements, and correction of faulty data, providing foundational knowledge for other social science disciplines. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","","Demography; Fertility; Forecasting; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Population Dynamics; Social Sciences; demography; fertility; forecasting; human; population dynamics; sociology; theoretical model","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (20BRK043)","National Social Science Foundation of China ,Grant/Award Number: 20BRK043 .","Aalen O.O., Statistical Inference for a Family of Counting Processes, (1975); Aalen O.O., Gjessing H.K., Understanding the shape of the hazard rate: a process point of view (with comments and a rejoinder by the authors), Stat.

We assessed the process by which social isolation increases the risk for all-cause and chronic disease mortality through proinflammatory mechanisms. Using the 18-year mortality follow-up data (n = 6,729) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-2006) on Social Network Index and multiple markers of chronic inflammation, we conducted survival analyses and found evidence that supports the mediation role of chronic inflammation in the link between social isolation and mortality. A high-risk fibrinogen level and cumulative inflammation burden may be particularly important in this link. There are notable sex differences in the mortality effects of social isolation in that they are greater for men and can be attributed in part to their heightened inflammatory responses. © American Sociological Association 2013.","cancer;

Despite attracting significant research attention due to the escalating bride price amount, few studies have focused on its impact on marriage quality. Using data from the 2020 Beijing and Chengdu Household Survey, this study examined how the bride price amount affects women's marital quality, including marital happiness, marital relationship quality, and exposure to domestic violence, based on three theoretical perspectives: marriage repayment theory, marriage endowment theory, and marriage signal theory. The study also incorporated interaction terms to investigate potential differences in the effects of bride price on women's marital quality between urban and rural areas. The results indicate that the current bride price practice is more aligned with the marriage endowment theory and has a statistically significant positive effect on urban women's marital happiness and relationship quality, but no effect was observed in rural areas. The influence of the bride price amount on the frequency of domestic violence against women also varied between urban and rural areas. Because men in rural areas face a disadvantage in the marriage market and there is a scarcity of available women, they are less likely to resort to domestic violence to manage marital conflicts when paying a higher bride price. © The Author(s) 2023.","Bride price; domestic violence; marital happiness; marriage endowment theory; quality of marital relationship","","","","","","Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation, (21DTR022); Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Beijing Municipal Social Science Foundation (grant number 21DTR022).

In this study, we examined mortality increase patterns between ages 40 and 85 in 16 low-mortality countries and demonstrated sex differences in these patterns, which also changed across period and cohort. These results suggest that the interaction between aging and death is more complicated than what is usually assumed from the Gompertz law and also challenge existing biodemographic hypotheses about the origin and mechanisms of sex differences in mortality. We propose a two-mortality model that explains these patterns as the change in the composition of intrinsic and extrinsic death rates with age.

This study explores the patterns of intergenerational relationships among Chinese families with multiple children and their associations with older parents' depressive symptoms. Methods: Through 3 waves (2014, 2016, and 2018) of nationally representative longitudinal data obtained from the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS), we used the k-means clustering method and fixed-effects models to address the research questions. Results: The findings revealed that over 41.64% of older parents had different types of intergenerational relationships with their different children. The closest parent-child relationship type was associated with the lowest levels of depressive symptoms among older parents, whereas the most estranged parent-child relationship type was associated with the highest levels of depressive symptoms. The most estranged parent-child relationship type (i.e., the alienated type) involving one child could reduce the psychological benefits gained through the closest type (i.e., the tight-knit type) involving another child. However, this moderation effect only manifested among socioeconomically privileged older parents. Discussion: These findings highlight the importance of adopting a systematic view for studies regarding intergenerational relationships. The impacts of a single parent-child relationship on parents can be influenced by other parent-child relationships. Moreover, in the context of the dramatic and uneven social changes throughout China, the interactive features of intergenerational relationships have revealed an emerging strong preference for all-round relational harmony across multiple children, particularly among privileged Chinese families. © 2023 The Author(s).

While the SM correlation is supported by data from developed countries before the second half of the twentieth century, the recent breakdown of the correlation pattern in these countries has prompted demographers to conclude that SM theory needs to be reassessed. In this paper we use a newly developed two-process vitality model to explain the SM correlation and its breakdown in terms of asynchronous trends in acute (extrinsic) and chronic (intrinsic) mortality factors. We propose that the mortality change in the first half of the twentieth century is largely determined by the elimination of immediate hazards to death, whereas the mortality change in the second half is primarily driven by the slowdown of the deterioration rate of intrinsic survival capacity. © 2015, © 2015 Population Investigation Committee.","Gompertz coefficients; intrinsic and extrinsic mortality; mortality pattern; SM correlation; vitality","Aging; Humans; Models, Statistical; Mortality; aging; correlation; demography; mortality; numerical model; aging; human; mortality; statistical model","","","","","985 project of Renmin University of China; National Institutes of Health, (1R21AG046770-01); Renmin University of China; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (1R21AG046 770-01); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R21AG046760); Bonneville Power Administration, BPA, (00039016, 1989-108-00)","2.

Methods: By using a national representative survey of older population, we constructed four intergenerational relationship types and conducted hierarchical multinomial logistic analyses to test the hypotheses. Results: The results showed that tightknit and loose relationship types shared 72% of the four types, reflecting a strong intergenerational solidarity among Chinese families. Parents with higher socioeconomic and health status tend to form closer relationships with their less accomplished children. However, when parents have poorer status in either socioeconomic or health factors, they would have a tighter relationship with their more accomplished children. Conclusions: These results support the second viewpoint that Chinese families primarily respond to the immediate needs of vulnerable members with a possible sacrifice of economic efficiency. The finding further suggests that Chinese extended families still serve as safety nets to guarantee the basic needs of its members and provide important resources to manage external social risks. Implications: The study contributes to the theoretical literature by adopting a collective family perspective and advances the understanding of how Chinese extended families are organized. It also has important implications that policies aiming to strengthen family solidarity should be adopted to support long-term development of families, which is crucial for Chinese society to cope with the challenges of rapid population aging. © 2021 National Council on Family Relations.","allocation of family resources; China; collective family perspective; intergenerational relationship; maximum utility; siblings","","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (20BRK043)","National Social Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 20BRK043 Funding information ","Barnett M.A., Scaramella L.V., Neppl T.K., Ontai L., Conger R.D., Intergenerational relationship quality, gender, and grandparent involvement, Family Relations, 59, 1, pp. 28-44, (2010); Becker G., A treatise on the family, (1981); Bengtson V., Giarrusso R., Mabry J.B., Silverstein M., Solidarity, conflict, and ambivalence: Complementary or competing perspectives on intergenerational relationships?, Journal of Marriage and Family, 64, 3, pp. 568-576, (2002); Bengtson V.L., Roberts E.L., Intergenerational solidarity in aging families: An example of formal theory construction, Journal of Marriage and Family, 53, 4, pp. 856-870, (1991); Cancian F.M., Oliker S.J., Caring and gender, (2000); Coleman J.S., Foundations of social theory, (1994); de Jong Gierveld J., Dykstra P.A., Schenk N., Living arrangements, intergenerational support types and older adult loneliness in Eastern and Western Europe, Demographic Research, 27, pp. 167-200, (2012); Eggebeen D.J., Davey A., Do safety nets work?

The extent to which these age changes differ by sex further contributes to this understanding but has not been well studied to date. We conducted a systematic examination of dynamics and heterogeneity of age changes in cancer mortality rates for the top 14 cancer sites using vital statistics from the NCHS and SEER between 1969 and 2007. We assessed patterns of age changes in site-specific mortality rates in terms of both increase (age slope) and acceleration (change in age slope) as measured by the log-log acceleration rate (LLA). We assessed sex differences in mortality rates through sex mortality rate ratios and sex differences in age changes through comparisons of the LLA by sex. The logged male-to-female mortality ratios are positive but vary substantially with age in magnitude. And the age patterns of sex ratios also vary across sites. The LLA values show similar declines and hence slowdowns of mortality increment into or during old age for both sexes for most sites and periods. Post-reproductive changes in sex differences in cancer mortality are not entirely consistent with the estrogenic hypothesis about the anticarcinogenic effects of sex hormones and suggest the utility of the multistage model of disease progression for some tumor sites. Analysis of age dynamics and sex differences in cancer mortality may modify extant aging-related theories of carcinogenesis and frame future searches for specific explanatory factors. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Aging; Cancer mortality; Estrogen; Multistage progression; Sex differences","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Sex Factors; Survival Rate; United States; estrogen; sex hormone; adult; aged; aging; antineoplastic activity; article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer localization; cancer mortality; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; controlled study; dynamics; esophagus cancer; female; hormone substitution; human; kidney cancer; leukemia; lung cancer; magnitude estimation method; male; nonhodgkin lymphoma; pancreas cancer; priority journal; prostate cancer; reproduction; sex difference; sex ratio; stomach cancer","","","","","University Cancer Research Funds; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (K01AG036745)","This work was supported by the National Institute of Aging grant number 1K01AG036745-01 to Y.Y. and the University Cancer Research Funds (UCRF) at Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) to Y.Y., T.L., and M.N.

Utilizing the Chinese national census and 1% population survey data from 1982 to 2015, this study demonstrates the transition of the Chinese household structure through typology analyses. Five typical regional household structure types—large lineal, large nuclear, small nuclear, mixed lineal, and small and diverse—are identified. Our findings demonstrate that since the 1980s, the household system in almost all Chinese regions has evolved from a large unitary model to a small diversified one. However, this evolutionary path diverged after 2000 and formed two distinct household structure systems. There are also significant regional differences in the transition trajectory. Influenced by developmental, cultural, and demographic factors, the regions exhibit four distinct transition paths: lineal tradition, nuclear retardation, smooth transition, and fast transition. On the basis of these results, we discuss family modernization and other theories in explaining the transition of the Chinese household structure. © 2020, Population Association of America.","China; Household structure transition; Regional difference; Typology analysis","China; Cultural Characteristics; Demography; Family Characteristics; Humans; Population Dynamics; Residence Characteristics; Social Change; Socioeconomic Factors; China; cultural factor; demography; family size; human; population dynamics; social change; socioeconomics","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (16JJD840013, 18JJD840001)","This research was supported by two MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Projects of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No. 16JJD840013 and 18JJD840001).
