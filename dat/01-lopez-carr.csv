However, the concept of ecosystem services has been interpreted and operationalized in a variety of ways, leaving a pronounced knowledge gap regarding how it is understood and implemented in different contexts. To better understand the conceptualization and implementation of the concept within United States National Forests, semi-structured interviews with planners and managers of the Pacific Northwest Region were conducted at the region, forest, and ranger district levels, addressing the following topics: (1) how has the ecosystem services concept been perceived by managers and planners?; (2) what are the perceived key ecosystem services offered by National Forest lands?; (3) how has the concept been applied at multiple spatial scales?; and (4) what are perceived challenges or opportunities related to applying the concept in the National Forest context? Results indicate that although participants had a high level of understanding of the ecosystem services concept, there was not a clear, widely adopted approach to considering ecosystem services in management. Through qualitative analysis, three general perspectives arose: one employed the concept to fulfill regulatory requirements at the National Forest scale, a second engaged with ecosystem services to improve participatory planning at the project scale, and a third, business as usual perspective, considered ecosystem services as new language for describing longstanding National Forest priorities. These results draw attention to the challenges of implementing an ecosystem services-based approach in the United States National Forest context and the continued need for the development of management-relevant methods for describing and quantifying ecosystem services. © 2021 by the authors.","Ecosystem services-based management; Forest planning; Perceptions of ecosystem services; U.s. national forest management","Pacific Northwest; United States; ecosystem service; forest management; natural resource; participatory approach; perception; prioritization; resource management","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, SBE, (1832315); California State University, CSU","Funding: This research was funded by a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award (1832315), a California State University Chancellor’s Doctoral Incentive Program Mini-Grant, and the College of Arts and Letters at San Diego State University.","Braat L.C., de Groot R., The Ecosystem Services Agenda: Bridging the Worlds of Natural Science and Economics, Conservation and Devel-Opment, and Public and Private Policy, Ecosyst.

Yet, it is reasonable to suppose that this aspect may apply more to to contexts where people enjoy more leisure time to admire a scenic vista or recreate in nature. How relevant is this aspect of nature-society relationships for people who rely more on natural resources, or provisioning ecosystem services, for livelihoods? We integrated qualitative and quantitative field research methods to examine how people in natural resource-dependent communities perceived the importance of different ecosystem services to wellbeing. We found that people with varying degrees of dependence on coastal, marine, and terrestrial provisioning ecosystem services perceived cultural ecosystem services—particularly scenic beauty, biodiversity, and space to recreate—as very important to wellbeing, and also perceived increases in wellbeing following interventions to foment small-scale tourism and conservation. In terms of global ecosystem management, our findings imply that (1) aesthetics and recreation matter, even if these cultural ecosystem services appear more often in the literature, (2) more efforts may be taken to make cultural ecosystem services more accessible, (3) small-scale tourism and conservation interventions may be reconsidered as potential means to increase wellbeing, and (4) reframing ecosystem management as explicit efforts to augment wellbeing may help to garner more widespread support and participation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aesthetic values; Ecosystem management; Human wellbeing; Latin America; Recreation; Scenic beauty","","","","","","Mellon Foundation Sawyer Seminars; UC Santa Barbara's Department of Geography; UC Santa Barbara’s Department of Geography; Wish Foundation; University of California, UC; Walton Family Foundation, (NC-120086); Walton Family Foundation; WITH Foundation","Funding text 1: We thank research participants who made this study possible and Alvaro Montaña Soto for help with the map.

A well established scientific consensus regarding the physical causes, dynamics, and at least many likely implications of anthropogenic climate change has thus far failed to result in any substantial movement towards mitigation. For many, then, the most urgent questions regarding climate change are now socio-cultural ones, such as: how do people come to hold and act on certain beliefs regarding environmental conditions and processes; how do institutional forms and histories shape and constrain the views and options of various sorts of actors; and what are relationships among fossil fuels, climate change, and the historical geographies and future trajectories of capitalism? Far from being simpler than physical and life science questions, these social science questions introduce entirely new sorts of actors, dynamics, and methodological challenges into this already complex and dynamic domain. This special issue takes up these topics. In this essay, we chart some of the major contours of contemporary social science thinking regarding climate change and introduce the articles in the special issue. We begin by examining work, from political science and scholarship on the commons, that foregrounds questions of sovereignty, territoriality, and cooperation with respect to environmental governance. Then we examine work from neoclassical economics and radical political economy, which frame climate change in terms of externalities, or contradiction and crisis, respectively. Finally, we examine the rapidly proliferating work exploring how individuals think and feel about these issues, emphasizing concepts of risk, communication, and governmentality. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Human–environment relationships; Political ecology; Political economy; Social theory","Behavioral research; Ecology; Economics; Fossil fuels; Anthropogenic climate changes; Dynamic domains; Environmental conditions; Environmental governances; Political ecology; Political economy; Political science; Social theory; anthropogenic effect; climate change; historical geography; nature-society relations; neoclassical theory; political economy; social theory; terrain; Climate change","","","","","","","Agrawal A., Environmentality: Community, intimate government, and the making of environmental subjects in Kumaon India, Current Anthropology, 46, 2, pp. 161-190, (2005); Agrawala S., Fankhauser S., Economic aspects of adaptation to climate change: Costs, benefits and policy instruments, (2008); Anderson P., In the tracks of historical materialism, (1983); Backstrand K., Lovbrand E., Planting trees to mitigate climate change: Contested discourses of ecological modernization, green governmentality and civic environmentalism, Global Environmental Politics, 6, 1, pp. 50-75, (2006); Bickerstaff K., Simmons P., Absencing/presencing risk: Rethinking proximity and the experience of living with major technological hazards, Geoforum, 40, 5, pp. 864-872, (2009); Bond P., Emissions trading, new enclosures and eco-social contestation, Antipode, 44, 3, pp. 684-701, (2011); Borras S.M., Hall R., Scoones I., White B., Wolford W., Towards a better understanding of global land grabbing: An editorial introduction, The Journal of Peasant Studies, 38, 2, pp. 209-216, (2011); Borras S.M., McMichael P., Scoones I., The politics of biofuels, land and agrarian change: Editors’ introduction, The Journal of Peasant Studies, 37, 4, pp. 575-592, (2010); Boykoff M.T., Who speaks for the climate?

The students completed one of the two experimental assignments as well as a control assignment that did not involve gaming, gathering data, or a computer. The groups were contrasted on their own evaluation of the assignments as well as their performance in multiple class outcomes. Our analysis found few significant differences between the group's self-evaluations of the assignments, their performance on the assignments, or their overall class grade. However, the 'control group' of students, who completed the control versions of the activities, performed significantly (p> .05) better on topic-relevant questions on the midterm (86% correct vs. 75%) and final examinations (94% vs. 87%). We conclude that completing the pen and paper version of the assignments resulted in better understanding of subject material. © Association of European Geographers.","Computer-based learning; Digital game based learning; Geography; Pedagogy; Serious games; web-based learning","","","","","","University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB","This research was conducted in part using funds from the Department of Instructional Development at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

While drivers of forest change occur at multiple scales, we examined forest change at the municipal and national scales integrated with global processes such as capital, commodity, and labor flows. We modeled multi-scale socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental drivers of local forest cover change. Consistent with LAC’s global leadership in soy and beef exports, primarily to China, Russia, the US, and the EU, national-level beef and soy production were the primary land use drivers of decreased forest cover. National level gross domestic product (GDP), migrant worker remittances and foreign investment, along with municipal-level temperature and area, were also significantly related to reduced forest cover. This challenges forest transition frameworks, which theorize that rising GDP and intensified agricultural production should be increasingly associated with forest regrowth. Instead, LAC forest change was linked to local, national, and global demographic, dietary and economic transitions, resulting in massive net forest cover loss. This suggests an urgent need to reconcile forest conservation with mounting global demand for animal protein. © 2022 by the authors.

The urban sprawl of UFA is the most complex, varied, and sensitive area for urbanization. However, the research on spatial governance in the UFA of megacities is still in the early. Therefore, this paper takes Xi'an as an example, using nighttime light (NTL) data as the basic data. ArcGIS software is used to generate contour lines and filter the boundary of UFA. We explored the characteristics and fragmentation of uneven expansion of the UFA and carried out spatial governance of the landscape fragmentation problem. Results show that: The UFA has been experiencing dynamic changes for a long time and the area reached 720.57 km2 in 2020. The landscape of the UFA is significantly fragmented. The dominant landscape changed from a single land use to a more mixed. Factors such as traffic networks and heritage sites are the main influencing factors for the fragmentation of UFA. To improve the landscape fragmentation of UFA, focusing on bottom-line control, ecological restoration and other aspects of governance may be effective ways. In addition, connecting urban areas with rural hinterlands, and carrying out targeted planning play an important part in the sustainable development of regional landscapes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Landscape fragmentation; Spatial governance; Urban fringe area; Urbanization; Xi'an","China; Shaanxi; Xian; ArcGIS; fragmentation; governance approach; landscape structure; urban sprawl; urbanization","","","","","Basic Research Top Talent Plan of Lanzhou Jiaotong University, (2022JC01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42271214); Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province, (21JR7RA278, 21JR7RA281); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFC3800700)","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42271214 ), Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province (No. 21JR7RA281 , 21JR7RA278 ), the National Key R & & D Program of China (No. 2022YFC3800700 ), Basic Research Top Talent Plan of Lanzhou Jiaotong University (No. 2022JC01 ).","Bai X., Shi P., Liu Y., Realizing China's urban dream, Nature, 509, pp. 158-160, (2014); Canedoli C., Crocco F., Comolli R., Padoa-Schioppa E., Landscape fragmentation and urban sprawl in the urban region of Milan, Landscape Research, 43, 5, pp. 632-651, (2018); Chang J., Qu Z., Xu R., Pan K., Xu B., Min Y., Ge Y., Assessing the ecosystem services provided by urban green spaces along urban center-edge gradients, Scientific Reports, 7, 1, (2017); Chen J., Li Z., Du B., Ten-year demographic changes in Shuangwan City: Xi'an's permanent population soared by 610,000 a year, while Beijing's working-age population shrank by one million[N], 11.29, (2021); Chang S., Wang J., Zhang F., Niu L., Wang Y., A study of the impacts of urban expansion on vegetation primary productivity levels in the Jing-Jin-Ji region, based on nighttime light data, Journal of Cleaner Production, 263, (2020); Chen G.Z., Li X., Liu X.P., Chen Y.M., Liang X., Leng J.Y., Huang K.N., Global projections of future urban land expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways, Nature Communications, 11, 1, pp. 1-12, (2020); Chen X., Liu Q., Zhang H., Quantitative measurement of spatial pattern of non-agricultural land in urban fringe, Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University, 31, 3, pp. 260-265, (2006); Chen Z., Yu B., Song W., Liu H., Wu Q., Shi K., Wu J., A new approach for detecting urban centers and their spatial structure with nighttime light remote sensing, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 55, 11, pp. 6305-6319, (2017); Chen Z., Yu S., You X., Yang C., Wang C., Lin J., Yu B., New nighttime light landscape metrics for analyzing urban-rural differentiation in economic development at township: A case study of Fujian province, China, Applied Geography, 150, (2023); Cheng P., Yue C., Evaluation of urban ecological environment and its relationship with human activities based on multi-source data, Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University, 47, 11, pp. 1927-1937, (2022); Connolly P., Observing the evolution of irregular settlements: Mexico city's colonias populares, 1990 to 2005, International Development Planning Review, 31, 1, pp. 1-36, (2009); Dadashpoor H., Azizi P., Moghadasi M., Land use change, urbanization, and change in landscape pattern in a metropolitan area, Science of the Total Environment, 655, pp. 707-719, (2019); Diaz-Caravantes R.E., Sanchez-Flores E., Water transfer effects on peri-urban land use/land cover: A case study in a semi-arid region of Mexico, Applied Geography, 31, 2, pp. 413-425, (2011); Ding Y., Hu J., Yang Y., Ma W., Jiang S., Pan X., Cao K., Monitoring the distribution and variations of city size based on night-time light remote sensing: A case study in the Yangtze river Delta of China, Remote Sensing, 14, (2022); Dong Q., Qu S., Qin J., Yi D., Liu Y., Zhang J., A method to identify urban fringe area based on the Industry density of POI, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 11, 2, (2022); Feng Z., Peng J., Wu J., Using DMSP/OLS nighttime light data and K–means method to identify urban–rural fringe of megacities, Habitat International, 103, (2020); Feng Z., Peng J., Wu J., Using DMSP/OLS nighttime light data and K–means method to identify urban–rural fringe of megacities, Habitat International, 103, (2020); Follmann A., Willkomm M., Dannenberg P., As the city grows, what do farmers do?

For each ecoregion’s terrestrial protected area (TPA) and unprotected area, a linear regression of woody vegetation area against time (10 years) was used to estimate 2001 and 2010 woody vegetation, respectively. We calculated a conversion-to-protection index, termed the Woody Conservation Risk Index, and identified trends in relation to existing conservation priorities. As a whole, the region lost 2.2% of its woody cover. High woody cover loss was observed for the Moist Forests (3.4% decrease) and the Flooded Grasslands/Savannas (11.2% decrease) biomes, while Mediterranean Forests exhibited a 5.8% increase. The Dry Forest Biome, the most threatened biome worldwide, experienced a 2% regional gain, which was surprising as we expected the opposite given a net regional loss for all biomes. Woody cover was more stable in TPAs in comparison to areas with no protection. Deforestation inside and surrounding TPAs remains high in humid ecoregions. High overall ecoregion deforestation, with stable TPAs, characterized some Amazonian ecoregions, the Dry Chaco, and moist forests on the eastern Andean foothills of Ecuador and Peru. Woody regrowth inside and outside of TPAs was observed in the Sonoran-Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forests and the Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests in Mexico. © 2021 by the authors.

Because of the struggle against forest loss, the Zagros forests (ZFs), which cover 3.5% of Iran's total land area, have been subjected to conservation policies. However, little is known about the efficacy of these strategies, and most information about dynamics of the ZFs is dependent on official data, which can be scant and unreliable. Therefore, the need for accurate statistics is felt more than ever in response to the requirements of international requests for information transparency. If positive or negative changes are recorded during the implementation of these policies, it is essential to assess the extent to which drivers were responsible for these changes. We assess the patterns of forest cover in the ZFs between 2002 and 2022 in the context of the implementation of one of Iran's most significant conservation policies. Furthermore, an evaluation of how forest dynamics relate to the main variables of FCC is performed. For this purpose, we used Landsat data and Google Earth Engine platform to calculate ZF cover dynamics for 61 counties in 11 provinces. Findings indicate that after 20 years of implementing conservation policies, the ZF cover has increased by 0.53%. Changes in the Human Development Index (HDI) and Gini indices were significant during the study period at the 95% confidence level, and the HDI demonstrated a significant correlation with Forest recovery (R = 0.151) and deforestation (R = −0.190) at the 95% confidence level. Changes in ZF have a significant relationship with distance from forests, roads, precipitation, and slope at the county level. In addition to the variables addressed in this research, conservation strategy played a positive role on ZF recovery. Findings can help clarify the changes and amount of forest cover, and have global consequences for concentrating more on improving the socioeconomic status of local people and conserving forests. © 2024","Binary logistic regression; Conservation strategy; Forest transition; GDP; Gini; Google earth engine; HDI","Conservation; Data; Deforestation; Dynamics; Engines; Forests; Patterns; Recovery; Dynamics; Engines; Landsat; Public policy; Binary logistic regression; Conservation policy; Conservation strategies; Forest cover; Forest transition; GDP; Gini; Google earth engine; Google earths; Human development index; Deforestation","","","","","","","Acacio V., Dias F.S., Catry F.X., Bugalho M.N., Moreira F., Canopy Cover Loss of Mediterranean Oak Woodlands: Long-Term Effects of Management and Climate, pp. 1-17, (2021); Ali J., Benjaminsen T.A., Hammad A.A., Dick O.B., The road to deforestation: an assessment of forest loss and its causes in Basho Valley, northern Pakistan, Glob.

Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, 93106-4060, CA, United States","The management of marine resources is a politically and culturally driven process, shaped by human livelihoods and perceptions, where notions of both space and place shape policies and decision-making in fundamental ways. An emerging sub-field within geography critically explores geographic aspects of marine resource management. However, there has been little work to fully articulate this field and to describe the contributions of geographic methodologies and lenses to understanding marine resource management processes. This special issue provides one of the first collections of geographic papers focused on the socio-cultural and socio-spatial dimensions of marine resource management, emphasizing research that has or can be applied to management and policy discussions. The papers in this issue cover critical topics within this emerging field, examining the combined influences of social, ecological, cultural, political, economic, historical, and geographic factors on how marine spaces and resources are used, perceived, and managed. Important themes include: emerging spatial approaches to marine resource management, human dimensions of marine protected areas, the roles of mapping and GIS, the integration of quantitative and qualitative data, and the varying ways in which marine spaces and places are conceptualized by marine resource users and managers. Issues of marine resource governance, community engagement, and vulnerability also play key roles in the future of marine resource management. The papers in this issue shed light on space, place, and human-environment interactions in coastal marine systems, making it clear that questions about stakeholder inclusion and representation, particularly in spatial forms, will continue to dominate the field for some time to come. Future research in this field will be fruitfully informed by core geographical heuristics of space, place, and human-environment dynamics. © 2015 The Authors.","Coastal management; GIS; Human-environment dynamics; Marine management; Marine protected areas; Marine spatial planning","","","","","","","","Agardy T., Ocean zoning: Making marine management more effective, (2010); Barnett A.J., Eakin H.C., We and us, not I and me"": Justice, social capital, and household vulnerability in a Nova Scotia fishery, Applied Geography, 59, pp. 107-116, (2015); Beitl C.M., Mobility in the mangroves: catch rates, daily decisions, and dynamics of artisanal fishing in a coastal commons, Applied Geography, 59, pp. 98-106, (2015); Berkes F., Feeny D., McCay B.J., Acheson J.M., The benefits of the commons, Nature, 340, pp. 91-93, (1989); Campbell L.M., Gray N.J., Hazen E.L., Shackeroff J.M., Beyond baselines: rethinking priorities for ocean conservation, Ecology and Society, 14, (2009); Chen C., Lopez-Carr D., The importance of place: Unraveling the vulnerability of fisherman livelihoods to the impact of marine protected areas, Applied Geography, 59, pp. 88-97, (2015); Conway F., Stevenson J., Hunter D., Stefanovich M., Campbell H., Covell Z., Et al., Ocean space, ocean place: the human dimensions of wave energy in Oregon, Oceanography, 23, pp. 82-91, (2010); Douvere F., The importance of marine spatial planning in advancing ecosystem-based sea use management, Marine Policy, 32, pp. 762-771, (2008); Guenther C., Lopez-Carr D., Lenihan H., Differences in lobster fishing before and after MPA establishment, Applied Geography, 59, pp. 78-87, (2015); Johannes R.E., Traditional marine conservation methods in oceania and their demise, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 9, pp. 349-364, (1978); Kittinger J.N., Koehn J.Z., Le Cornu E., Ban N.C., Gopnik M., Armsby M., Et al., Apractical approach for putting people in ecosystem-based ocean planning, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 12, pp. 448-456, (2014); Klein C., Chan A., Kircher L., Cundiff A., Gardner N., Hrovat Y., Et al., Striking a balance between biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic viability in the design of marine protected areas, Conservation Biology, 22, pp. 691-700, (2008); Levine A.S., Feinholz C.L., Participatory GIS to inform coral reef ecosystem management: mapping human coastal and ocean uses in Hawaii, Applied Geography, 59, pp. 60-69, (2015); Lubchenco J., Palumbi S., Gaines S.D., Andelman S., Plugging a hole in the ocean: the emerging science of marine reserves, Ecological Applications, 13, pp. S3-S7, (2003); Mascia M.B., Claus C.A., Naidoo R., Impacts of marine protected areas on fishing communities, Conservation Biology, 24, pp. 1424-1429, (2010); McCay B.J., Acheson J.M., The question of the commons: The culture and ecology of communal resources, (1990); McCay B.J., Jones P.J.S., Marine protected areas and the governance of marine ecosystems and fisheries, Conservation Biology, 25, pp. 1130-1133, (2011); McLain R., Poe M., Biedenweg K., Cerveny L., Besser D., Blahna D., Making sense of human ecology mapping: an overview of approaches to integrating socio-spatial data into environmental planning, Human Ecology, 41, pp. 651-665, (2013); Nader L., Naked science: Anthropological inquiry into boundaries, power, and knowledge, (1996); Ostrom E., Ageneral framework for analyzing sustainability of social-ecological systems, Science, 325, pp. 419-422, (2009); Pomeroy R., Douvere F., The engagement of stakeholders in the marine spatial planning process, Marine Policy, 32, pp. 816-822, (2008); Quimby B., Emerging customs: small-scale fishing practices in Aceh, Indonesia, Applied Geography, 59, pp. 125-130, (2015); Richmond L., Kotowicz D., Equity and access in marine protected areas: the history and future of 'traditional indigenous fishing'in the marianas trench marine national monument, Applied Geography, 59, pp. 117-124, (2015); Rossiter J.S., Curti G.H., Moreno C.M., Lopez-Carr D., Marine-space assemblages: towards a different praxis of fisheries policy and management, Applied Geography, 59, pp. 142-149, (2015); Rossiter J.S., Levine A., What makes a ""successful"" marine protected area?

However, it remains unclear how to quantify the constraining effect of UGBs on urban sprawl and the degree of fragmentation after UGBs constrain urban sprawl. Here, we proposed a UGBs extraction method to explore the spatial evolution of UGBs in the rapidly expanding megacity Beijing from 2000 to 2020. We also quantitatively investigated the role of UGBs in constraining urban sprawl and measured the degree of fragmentation of the UGBs after constraining urban sprawl with the help of the constraint assessment index, the Urban Annual Ring model, and the landscape pattern index. Results showed that: (1) Beijing's UGBs area showed a “V”-shaped trend of first decreasing and then increasing from 2000 to 2020, decreasing from 332.61 km2 in 2000 to 303.41 km2 in 2015, and then increasing to 369.42 km2 in 2020, which is equivalent to about 54 Beijing Olympic Forest Parks. (2) The UGBs’ role in constraining urban sprawl was characterized by gradual enhancement in three periods from 2005 to 2020. The boundary containment rate (BCR) of urban sprawl was 0.48, 0.22, and 0.14 respectively. After the construction of the newly planned UGBs in 2005, the speed of urban sprawl from 2010 to 2015 decreased by 10.90%. (3) The fragmentation of UGBs showed an upward trend and connectivity showed a downward trend. The patch density (PD) characterizing fragmentation increased from 17.22 in 2000 to 31.60 in 2020, and the patch aggregation index (AI) characterizing connectivity decreased from 86.92 to 79.73. The research can provide a reference for other similar sized cities in UGB planning and government decision-making. © 2024 The Authors","Beijing; Constraining effect; Fragmentation; Green space; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); Urban fringe; Urban green belts; Urban sprawl","Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; fragmentation; greenbelt; greenspace; megacity; quantitative analysis; Sustainable Development Goal; urban sprawl","","","","","Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Gansu Province “Innovation Star, (2023CXZX-577); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42271214); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Lanzhou Jiaotong University, LZJTU, (2022JC01); Lanzhou Jiaotong University, LZJTU; Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province, (21JR7RA281, 21JR7RA278); Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province; International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals, (CBAS2023ORP04)","Funding text 1: This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42271214), the Open Research Program of the International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals (Grant No. CBAS2023ORP04), Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province (No. 21JR7RA281, 21JR7RA278), the CAS’ Light of West China’ Program, Basic Research Top Talent Plan of Lanzhou Jiaotong University (No. 2022JC01), Gansu Province “Innovation Star” Project (2023CXZX-577).; Funding text 2: This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.42271214), the Open Research Program of the International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals (Grant No. CBAS2023ORP04)，Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province (No.21JR7RA281, 21JR7RA278), the CAS’ Light of West China’ Program, Basic Research Top Talent Plan of Lanzhou Jiaotong University (No.2022JC01), Gansu Province “Innovation Star” Project (2023CXZX-577).","Amati M., Taylor L., From green belts to green infrastructure, Plan.

The complex ecology of these diseases creates a global health problem not easily solved with medical treatment alone. Methods: We quantified the current global disease burden caused by environmentally mediated infectious diseases and used a structural equation model to explore environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with the human burden of environmentally mediated pathogens across all countries. Findings: We found that around 80% (455 of 560) of WHO-tracked pathogen species known to infect humans are environmentally mediated, causing about 40% (129 488 of 359 341 disability-adjusted life years) of contemporary infectious disease burden (global loss of 130 million years of healthy life annually). The majority of this environmentally mediated disease burden occurs in tropical countries, and the poorest countries carry the highest burdens across all latitudes. We found weak associations between disease burden and biodiversity or agricultural land use at the global scale. In contrast, the proportion of people with rural poor livelihoods in a country was a strong proximate indicator of environmentally mediated infectious disease burden. Political stability and wealth were associated with improved sanitation, better health care, and lower proportions of rural poverty, indirectly resulting in lower burdens of environmentally mediated infections. Rarely, environmentally mediated pathogens can evolve into global pandemics (eg, HIV, COVID-19) affecting even the wealthiest communities. Interpretation: The high and uneven burden of environmentally mediated infections highlights the need for innovative social and ecological interventions to complement biomedical advances in the pursuit of global health and sustainability goals.

Assessing the ecological restoration status of key nature reserves and developing a new conservation and development framework are fundamental for achieving ecological civilization and enhancing sustainability. As an ecological security barrier in the northwestern alpine region, Qilian Mountain National Park (QMNP), is of great significance for maintaining the sustainable ecological environment of western China. By measuring changes in ecological land use and monitoring key vegetation indicator trends in QMNP, we constructed the Regional Ecological Resilience Indicator (RERI) and proposed a new restoration and restoration framework. The results show that: (1) the ecological land restoration in QMNP was remarkable, with a total of 721.76 km2 of non-ecological land converted to ecological land, representing a 1.44% increase. Forest restoration covered 110 km2, primarily made up of previously unused land from 2000 to 2020. (2) The average NDVI value increased by 0.025. Regions showing productivity growth (NPP) accounted for 51.82% of the total area from 2000 to 2020. The four typical eco-migration zones reduced the building profile area by 47.72% between 2015 and 2019. The distribution of high Composite Vegetation Index (CFI) values overlapped with concentrated forest restoration areas, revealing two main restoration models: forest conservation and population relocation. (3) RERI calculations divided the park into three ecological zones, Priority Conservation Area (PCA), Optimization and Enhancement Area (OEA), and Concerted Development Area (CDA), leading to the proposal of an ecological restoration and development framework for QMNP, characterized by “three zones, two horizontal axes, and one vertical axis”. Our findings contribute to strengthening the ecological security barrier in northwestern China; they offer new insights for the long-term, stable improvement of the ecological environment in QMNP and in other critical protected area systems globally. © 2024 by the authors.","conservation pattern; ecological immigration; forest protection; national park; Qilian Mountain","China; Qilian Mountains; climate change; conservation; forest management; human activity; national park; protected area; sustainability","","","","","Intergovernmental International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Program; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2024YFE0198600, 2022YFC3800700); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42271214); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Gansu Province ‘Innovation Star, (2025CXZX)","This research was funded by Intergovernmental International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Program under National Key Research and Development Plan: 2024YFE0198600; National Natural Science Foundation of China: 42271214; National Key R&D Program of China: 2022YFC3800700; Gansu Province \u2018Innovation Star\u2019 Project: 2025CXZX.","Wang F., Harindintwali J.D., Wei K., Shan Y., Mi Z., Costello M.J., Grunwald S., Feng Z., Wang F., Guo Y., Et al., Climate change: Strategies for mitigation and adaptation, Innov.

While various tools and measures are under examination for building and enhancing resilience capacity in order to improve the preparedness of these communities for future events, social capital has been shown to influence how local communities can be resilient using their social connectedness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the function of social capital in informing and improving the resilience capacity process of coastal communities in northern Iran. This study used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods and analyzed a number of social capital indicators in the study area in a field survey using questionnaires and techniques of inferential statistics (i.e., Pearson correlation and T-test). For this reason, 376 residents from the towns that sustained the largest human and financial losses were chosen for examination. The results showed that bonding capital has a considerable effect on the community's resilience capacity. Moreover, some social capital criteria, including respect for the rights of the neighbors, existence of public green space, children's playground, and planting trees, are the most important criteria in developing capacities for enhancing resilience among the residents of the community under study. This shows that developing community resilience through social ability and trust will be more successful than doing so by just raising awareness of hazard threats. This study recommends that further efforts be made to increase the capability of both formal and informal communal institutions. The structural adjustments that are necessary, on the other hand, are difficult. © 2023","Bonding capital; Coastal communities; Resilience building; Social assets; Vulnerable communities","","","","","","","","Adger W., Social capital, collective action, and adaptation to climate change, Econ.

Here, we show how knowledge of environmental perceptions explicitly links these two lines of research. We examined how a diverse community of people with varying degrees of dependencies on coastal and marine ecosystems in southern Chile perceived the importance of different ecosystem services (ESs), their states (e.g., doing well, needs improvement), and management options. Our analysis indicates that an understanding of people's perceptions may usefully guide ecosystem modeling and management efforts by helping to: (1) define which ESs to enter into models and tradeoff analyses (i.e., what matters most?), (2) guide where to focus management efforts (i.e., what matters yet needs improvement?), and, (3) anticipate potential support or controversy surrounding management interventions. Finally, we discuss the complexity inherent in defining which ESs matter most to people. We propose that future research address how to design ES approaches and assessments that are more inclusive to diverse world views and notions of human wellbeing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Chile; Coastal marine spatial planning; Human wellbeing; Natural resource management; Tradeoff analysis; Valuation","Chile; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Perception; Chile; Behavioral research; Decision making; Human resource management; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Resource valuation; Chile; Coastal marine spatial planning; Ecosystem services; Environmental decision making; Guide models; Human wellbeing; Management efforts; Marine Spatial Planning; Trade-off analysis; Valuation; coastal zone management; ecosystem service; modeling; natural resource; perception; quality of life; resource management; spatial planning; trade-off; valuation; adult; aged; Article; Chile; coastal waters; community sample; controlled study; environmental management; estuary; female; human; human activities; knowledge; male; marine environment; perception; priority journal; quantitative study; statistical model; wellbeing; decision making; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; perception; procedures; theoretical model; Ecosystems","","","","","Mellon Foundation Sawyer Seminars; UC Santa Barbara 's Department of Geography; University of California, UC; University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB; Walton Family Foundation; WITH Foundation","Funding text 1: We thank research participants who made this study possible, Alvaro Montaña Soto and Christian Guzmán Lagos for help with figures, and Samuel Yang and Justin Suarez for help with data entry and analysis.

Based on semi-structured interviews with early program participants enrolling either collectively- or individually-held land, we evaluated whether and how SocioPáramo, a national-scale PES program targeting Ecuadorian Andean grasslands (páramos), has the potential to contribute to local livelihoods (financial, natural, social, human, and physical capital) and sustainable resource management. Low conservation opportunity costs associated with pre-existing constraints on land use and the existence of alternative livelihood options appeared to facilitate largely positive financial capital outcomes, although we found reduced financial capital among some smaller and medium-sized landholders who were required to eliminate burning and grazing. We found the greatest potential for improved social, financial, and natural capital among well-organized community participants enrolling collective land, while greater attention to building capacity of individual smaller landholders could improve outcomes for those participants. These results help fill a gap in knowledge by drawing on empirical data to demonstrate how divergent outcomes have begun to emerge among different groups of SocioPáramo participants, providing lessons for PES program design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation; Ecuador; Payment for Ecosystem Services; Páramo; Poverty alleviation; SocioPáramo","","","","","","SDSU University; National Science Foundation, NSF, (0851532)","This study would not have been possible without the support, patience, and enthusiasm of many people.

We combined ecological data of sea urchin and macroalgal abundance with fishery data of spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) landings to evaluate whether: (1) patterns in the abundance and biomass among lobster (predator), sea urchins (grazer), and macroalgae (primary producer) in giant kelp forest communities indicated the presence of top-down control on urchins and macroalgae, and (2) lobster fishing triggers a trophic cascade leading to increased sea urchin densities and decreased macroalgal biomass. Eight years of data from eight rocky subtidal reefs known to support giant kelp forests near Santa Barbara, CA, USA, were analyzed in three-tiered least-squares regression models to evaluate the relationships between: (1) lobster abundance and sea urchin density, and (2) sea urchin density and macroalgal biomass. The models included reef physical structure and water depth. Results revealed a trend towards decreasing urchin density with increasing lobster abundance but little evidence that urchins control the biomass of macroalgae. Urchin density was highly correlated with habitat structure, although not water depth. To evaluate whether fishing triggered a trophic cascade we pooled data across all treatments to examine the extent to which sea urchin density and macroalgal biomass were related to the intensity of lobster fishing (as indicated by the density of traps pulled). We found that, with one exception, sea urchins remained more abundant at heavily fished sites, supporting the idea that fishing for lobsters releases top-down control on urchin grazers. Macroalgal biomass, however, was positively correlated with lobster fishing intensity, which contradicts the trophic cascade model. Collectively, our results suggest that factors other than urchin grazing play a major role in controlling macroalgal biomass in southern California kelp forests, and that lobster fishing does not always catalyze a top-down trophic cascade. © 2012 Guenther et al.","","Animals; California; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Food Chain; Kelp; Palinuridae; Population Density; Echinoidea; lobster; Macrocystis pyrifera; Palinuridae; Panulirus interruptus; article; community structure; fishing; habitat structure; macroalga; nonhuman; Panulirus interruptus; population abundance; population density; predator prey interaction; sea urchin; trophic cascade; United States","","","","","","","Pace M.L., Cole J.J., Carpenter S.R., Kitchell J.F., Trophic cascades revealed in diverse ecosystems, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 14, pp. 483-488, (1999); Terbourgh J., Estes J.A., Trophic cascades: Predator, prey, and the changing dynamics of nature, (2010); Hairston G.N., Smith F.E., Slobodkin L.B., Community structure, population control, and competition, American Naturalist, 94, pp. 421-425, (1960); Strong D.R., Are trophic cascades all wet?

In this article, we use quantitative and qualitative methods to assess how different funding sources influence the initiative to adapt to water scarcity in the Colombian Andes. We compare efforts to adapt to water scarcity in 111 rural Andean communities with varied dependence on external funding for water management activities. Findings suggest that despite efforts to use their own internal resources, communities often need external support to finance adaptation strategies. However, not all external financial support positively impacts a community's abilities to adapt. Results show the importance of community-driven requests for external support. In cases where external support was unsolicited, the results show a decline, or ""crowding-out,"" in community efforts to adapt. In contrast, in cases where communities initiated the request for external support to fund their own projects, findings show that external intervention is more likely to enhance or ""crowds-in"" community-driven adaptation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptive capacity; Collective action; Community-based resource management; Crowding-out; Latin America; Water scarcity","Colombia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Fund Raising; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Rural Population; Water Supply; Andes; Colombia; Latin America; Environmental management; Water management; Adaptive capacity; Collective action; Crowding out; Latin America; Resource management; Water scarcity; adaptive management; collective action; community resource management; environmental change; environmental impact; local participation; resource scarcity; water management; water supply; adaptation; article; Colombia; community; funding; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rural population; water management; water supply; Finance","","","","","","","Adger W.N., Social capital, collective action, and adaptation to climate change, Econ Geogr, 79, 4, pp. 387-404, (2003); Bardhan P., Efficiency, equity and poverty alleviation: Policy issues in less developed countries, Econ J, 106, 438, pp. 1344-1356, (1996); Berkes F., Turner N.J., Knowledge, learning and the evolution of conservation practice for social-ecological system resilience, Hum Ecol, 34, 4, pp. 479-494, (2006); Boulanger J.P., Martinez F., Segura E.C., Projection of future climate change conditions using IPCC simulations, neural networks and Bayesian statistics.

Lack of knowledge about local communities' perceptions of resettlement, however, can lead to failed relocation projects and negative impacts on environmental sustainability and livelihoods. To better understand local communities' perception of relocation in PAs, we examine factors that affect local communities' willingness to relocate in Dashanbao Protected Area (DPA), an important location for conservation of the rare Black-necked Crane and the subject of a large-scale relocation policy in China. We surveyed 512 households in DPA and used multiple logistic regression to identify which factors predict local communities' willingness to relocate. Then, we examined how local communities' opinions of different payment for environmental services programs (PES) impacted their willingness to relocate. The results indicated that participation in a PES program for wetland conservation significantly decreases willingness, while distance from scenic spots and roads increases willingness. Furthermore, participants in the PES program for wetlands had a greater positive perception of the benefits from the DPA. Concern about a sustainable livelihood and loss of a sense of belonging represent the two main categories or ‘clusters’ of reasons explaining unwillingness to relocate. Our results suggest that prior experience with PES programs influences attitudes about relocation, and that integrating the perception of local communities into policy is important to the success of conservation programs relying on relocation. Managers and decision-makers could usefully consider the coupled relationships between sustainable livelihood strategies such as PES, attitudes toward relocation, and conservation benefits when working with communities in PAs toward enhanced livelihoods and conservation. © 2020","Conservation and park policy; Coupled human and natural system; Ecological relocation (ER); Environmental perception; Payment for environmental services (PES)","Attitude; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Policy; Wetlands; China; Grus nigricollis; Conservation; Decision making; Logistic regression; Relocation; Sustainable development; Wetlands; Conservation benefits; Conservation programs; Environmental pressures; Environmental sustainability; Multiple logistic regression; Payment for environmental services; Sustainable livelihood; Wetland conservation; decision making; environmental policy; human settlement; livelihood; nature conservation; perception; protected area; relocation; sustainability; adult; article; attitude; China; household; human; manager; perception; wetland; China; environmental protection; policy; wetland; Environmental protection","","","","","Dashanbao Black-necked Crane National Nature Reserve; Key National Social Science Foundation of China, (14AZD107); University of Southern California, USC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51278347); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: We thank the administration of Dashanbao Black-necked Crane National Nature Reserve, especially Sun Rong, Chuxiong Lu, Xianxiong Luo, Yuanjian Wang.

A recent hypothesis argues that dams block reproduction of the migratory river prawns that eat the snail hosts of schistosomiasis. In the Senegal River Basin, there is evidence that prawn populations declined and schistosomiasis increased after completion of the Diama Dam. Restoring prawns to a water-access site upstream of the dam reduced snail density and reinfection rates in people. However, whether a similar cascade of effects (from dams to prawns to snails to human schistosomiasis) occurs elsewhere is unknown. Here, we examine large dams worldwide and identify where their catchments intersect with endemic schistosomiasis and the historical habitat ranges of large, migratory Macrobrachium spp. prawns. River prawn habitats are widespread, and we estimate that 277–385 million people live within schistosomiasis-endemic regions where river prawns are or were present (out of the 800 million people who are at risk of schistosomiasis). Using a published repository of schistosomiasis studies in sub-Saharan Africa, we compared infection before and after the construction of 14 large dams for people living in: (i) upstream catchments within historical habitats of native prawns, (ii) comparable undammed watersheds, and (iii) dammed catchments beyond the historical reach of migratory prawns. Damming was followed by greater increases in schistosomiasis within prawn habitats than outside prawn habitats. We estimate that one third to one half of the global population-at-risk of schistosomiasis could benefit from restoration of native prawns. Because dams block prawn migrations, our results suggest that prawn extirpation contributes to the sharp increase of schistosomiasis after damming, and points to prawn restoration as an ecological solution for reducing human disease. © 2017 The Authors.","Bilharzia; Biological control; Dam; Disease control; Planetary health; Schistosome","Africa South of the Sahara; Animal Migration; Animals; Food Chain; Humans; Palaemonidae; Schistosomiasis; Snails; Diama Dam; Senegal Basin; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Macrobrachium; Metapenaeus bennettae; Schistosoma; biological control; crustacean; disease control; disease prevalence; disease vector; environmental restoration; flatworm; health risk; home range; migration; migratory species; parasitic disease; population decline; public health; reproduction; schistosomiasis; snail; Africa south of the Sahara; animal; food chain; human; Palaemonidae; parasitology; physiology; population migration; schistosomiasis; snail; transmission","","","","","National Science Foundation Coupled Natural and Human Systems; Stanford Institute for Innovation; Stanford Mentoring Undergraduates in Interdisciplinary Research; Stanford Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education; Stanford Woods Institute's Environmental Ventures Projects; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1360330, 1414102, 1646708); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (K01AI091864, R01AI125842); National Institutes of Health, NIH; Fogarty International Center, FIC, (R01TW010286); Fogarty International Center, FIC; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (1114050); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; California State University, CSU","S.H.S., I.J.J., D.L. and G.A.D.L. received support from a grant from the Stanford Woods Institute's Environmental Ventures Projects.

Mangroves provide vital protection to Caribbean island coastline, substantial economic benefit, and crucial habitat for surrounding reef ecosystems. However, Caribbean island mangroves are shrinking as urban areas expand. Such deforestation is of considerable global environmental concern. This study applies a random forest classifier to thirteen Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes from 1985 to 2015 covering Roatán, Honduras, the largest of the Bay Islands. Results indicate that urban area increased by 982.8 ha (227.7%), with 224.1 ha (−19.1%) of mangroves converted to urban areas. Island-wide and outside of protected areas, a significant relationship was found between urban expansion and mangrove loss. Designated protected reserves have stemmed cutting of mangroves and allowed mangroves to fully recover following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. However, despite being illegal under national and international laws, mangrove loss is accelerating outside of protected areas to accommodate growing urban area and tourism infrastructure. This research suggests that rapid urbanization and tourism development in the Caribbean may decrease island ecosystem resiliency to environmental stressors and impair the sustainability of tourism development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Caribbean; Land use-cover change; Mangroves; Remote sensing; Urbanization","Caribbean Islands; Honduras; Islas de la Bahia; Roatan; Rhizophoraceae; deforestation; land cover; land use change; Landsat thematic mapper; mangrove; remote sensing; urban area; urbanization","","","","","University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB","This work was supported by funding from the Broom Center for Demography at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Some development practitioners note the potential to combine solutions to population-environment (PE) together with health-environment (HE) initiatives for the global conservation of natural resources in developing countries while simultaneously improving human health and livelihood security. PHE advocates in the policy arena have promoted the importance of integrating ""conservation, health, and family planning (FP) interventions"" in the management of some of the world's most socio-economically impoverished as well as ecologically rich environments. However, scant scholarly evidence supports these claims. In this paper, we probe the potential effectiveness of integrated PHE investments for conservation outcomes. Data was collected in World Wildlife Fund (WWF) designated high priority marine and terrestrial conservation sites with USAID-sponsored PHE programs in the Philippines, Nepal, India, Mozambique, Madagascar, Kenya, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. We conducted individual and focus-group interviews with 754 individuals: WWF staff, staff from partner health and environment organizations, and local men and women in the program service areas. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate diverse, and in some cases dramatic, improvements in maternal and child health and conservation measures that overall appeared to benefit from the integrative PHE approach. Results also point toward the importance of promoting PHE interventions within the framework of livelihood improvement. © All rights reserved.","Conservation; Family planning; Fertility; Migration; Population-Health-Environment;

This study examines the fertility–environment association using empirical data from Ecuadorian Amazon between 1980 and 1999. Fertility dramatically declined during this period, and our empirical models suggest that households’ relationship to land partially explains this decline. Controlling for known fertility determinants such as age and education, women in households lacking land titles experienced a 27 % higher birth rate than did women in households with land titles. This suggests insecure land tenure was associated with higher fertility. Furthermore, each additional hectare of new pasture was associated with a 16 % higher birth rate, suggesting the potential role of a more stable and lucrative income source in supporting additional births. Findings from this research can help inform strategic policies to address sustainable development in frontier environments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Amazon; Ecuador; Environment; Fertility; Human–environment; Land tenure; Land use","Amazonia; Ecuador; birth rate; empirical analysis; fertility; land tenure; land use; sustainable development","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1128040)","","Anderton D., Bean L., Birth spacing and fertility limitation: A behavioral analysis of a nineteenth century frontier population, Demography, 22, 2, pp. 169-183, (1985); Barbieri A., Carr D.L., Gender-specific out-migration, deforestation, and urbanization in the Ecuadorian Amazon, Global and Planetary Change, 47, 2-4, pp. 99-110, (2005); Barbieri A.F., Carr D.L., Bilsborrow R.E., Migration within the Frontier: The second generation colonization in the Ecuadorian Amazon, Population Research and Policy Review, 28, 3, pp. 291-320, (2009); Baron R., Kenny D., The moderator–mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Becker G.S., An economic analysis of fertility, Demographic and economic change in developed countries, pp. 209-231, (1960); Bilsborrow R.E., Population pressures and agricultural development in developing countries: A conceptual framework and recent evidence, World Development, 15, 2, pp. 183-203, (1987); Bilsborrow R.E., Barbieri A., Pan W.K., Changes in population and land use over time in the Ecuadorian Amazon, Acta Amazonica, 34, 4, pp. 635-647, (2004); Bilsborrow R.E., Carr D.L., Population, agricultural land use and the environment in developing countries, Tradeoffs or synergies?

Getis-Ord Gi* spatial clustering analyses reveal statistically significant locations of spatio-temporal precipitation decline coinciding with high population density and increase. Statistically significant areas are evident, particularly across central, southern, and eastern Africa. The highly populated Lake Victoria basin emerges as a particularly salient hot spot. People located in the regions highlighted in this analysis suffer exceptionally high exposure to negative climate change impacts (as populations increase on lands with decreasing rainfall). Results may help inform further hot spot mapping and related research on demographic vulnerabilities to climate change. Results may also inform more suitable geographical targeting of policy interventions across the continent. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Africa; Climate change; Hazards; Population; Spatial modeling; Vulnerability","East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; climate change; cluster analysis; modeling; population density; population dynamics; precipitation (climatology); spatial analysis; vulnerability","","","","","Agricultural Drought for the Greater Horn of Africa; US Drought Portal; USAID Office of Food for Peace, (FFP-P-10-00002); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (10AN26I, 12AU22I); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA; U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, (09AC000001)","Acknowledgments This work was supported through USGS cooperative agreement #G09AC000001 ‘‘Monitoring and Forecasting Climate, Water and Land Use for Food Production in the Developing World,’’ with funding from the NASA Applied Sciences Program, Decisions award #NN10AN26I for ‘‘A Land Data Assimilation System for Famine Early Warning,’’ and SERVIR award #NNH12AU22I for ‘‘A Long Time-Series Indicator of Agricultural Drought for the Greater Horn of Africa’’; USAID Office of Food for Peace, award #AID-FFP-P-10-00002 for ‘‘Famine Early Warning Systems Network Support’’; and the USGS Land Change Science Program.

Land degradation reduces agricultural productivity, impacts the provision of vital ecosystem services, and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through Sustainable Development Goal 15.3, sets out to achieve land degradation neutrality (LDN) by improving the livelihoods of those most affected and building resilience in areas affected by or at risk from degradation. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) leads the charge in creating a spatially explicit framework for monitoring and reporting on LDN goals that countries can integrate into their land planning policies. However, it remains difficult to operationalize the integration of biophysical indicators of land degradation with climatic and socio-economic indicators to assess the impact of land degradation on vulnerable populations. We present an integrative framework that demonstrates how freely available global geospatial data sets can be leveraged through an open-source platform (Trends.Earth) to simplify and operationalize monitoring and reporting on progress towards achieving LDN. Then, we summarize a suite of data sets and approaches that can be used to understand and quantify the socio-ecological interactions between drought, land degradation and population exposed to desertification, land degradation and drought. We discuss how improvements in Earth observation data sets and algorithms will allow UNCCD land-based progress sub-indicators (changes in primary productivity, land cover, soil organic carbon, drought, and population exposure) to be computed at enhanced spatial resolutions. © 2022 The Authors.

Monitoring forest cover change is critical for assessing ecosystem changes and targeting conservation efforts. Yet the most biodiverse forests on the planet are also the most difficult to monitor remotely due to their frequent cloud cover. To begin to reconcile this problem, we develop and implement an effective and efficient approach to mapping forest loss in the extremely cloud-prevalent southern Ghana region using dense time series Landsat 7 and 8 images from 1999 to 2018, based on median value temporal compositing of a novel vegetation index called the spectral variability vegetation index (SVVI). Resultant land-cover and land-use maps yielded 90 to 94% mapping accuracies. Our results indicate 625 km                             2                              of forest loss within the 9800-km                             2                              total mapping area, including within forest reserves and their environs between circa 2003 and 2018. Within the reserves, reduced forest cover is found near the reserve boundaries compared with their interiors, suggesting a more degraded environment near the edge of the protected areas. A fully protected reserve, Kakum National Park, showed little forest cover change compared with many other less protected reserves (such as a production reserve—Subri River). Anthropogenic activities, such as mining, agriculture, and built area expansion, were the main land-use transitions from forest. The reserves and census districts that are located near large-scale open pit mining indicated the most drastic forest loss. No significant correlation was found between the magnitudes of forest cover change and population density change for reserves and within a 1.5-km buffer surrounding the reserves. While other anthropogenic factors should be explored in relation to deforestation, our qualitative analysis revealed that reserve protection status (management policies) appears to be an important factor. The mapping approach described in this study provided a highly accurate and effective means to monitor land-use changes in forested and cloud-prone regions with great promise for application to improved monitoring of moist tropical and other forests characterized by high cloud cover.                          © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deforestation;

Although numerous biological studies have been conducted to understand the alteration in bat behavior due to artificial night lights, mapping the intrusion of nighttime light into bat habitats remains largely unexplored. Objective: In this study, we aim to visualize the exposure likelihood of bat habitats to nighttime light in the United States over the past 30 years. Methods: We propose a novel method known as the ""Emerging Bivariate Cluster"" which has the potential to pinpoint locations experiencing the most significant exposure likelihood of bat habitats to nighttime light over time. Results: Our results show that the low count nighttime light value is decreasing for 24.9% of bat habitats in the contiguous United States. Additionally, 1.4% of bat habitats are likely to experience persistent exposure over the years. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in hotspot intervention patterns across different regions, highlighting the probable areas where light pollution is escalating. Conclusion: The insights gleaned from this study illuminate critical areas for future research and conservation efforts, pinpointing specific locations where the impact of artificial nighttime lighting on bat habitats is most likely to be pronounced. By highlighting these areas, our findings offer a roadmap for biological scientists seeking to delve deeper into the effects of light pollution on nocturnal wildlife. Moreover, the identification of these key exposure likelihood zones provides a valuable foundation for developing targeted mitigation strategies, aiming to preserve bat populations and maintain ecological balance. This research not only contributes to our understanding of the spatial–temporal patterns of light pollution but also emphasizes the necessity of implementing informed conservation practices to safeguard the natural nocturnal environment. © The Author(s) 2024.","Bat habitat; Nighttime light; Spatial–temporal analysis","United States; bat; cluster analysis; foundation; hot spot; igneous intrusion; light pollution; mitigation; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","","","Anselin L., Local indicators of spatial association—LISA, Geogr Anal, 27, 2, pp. 93-115, (1995); Baugh K., Elvidge C.D., Ghosh T., Ziskin D., Development of a 2009 stable lights product using DMSP-OLS data, Proc Asia-Pac Adv Netw, 30, (2010); Davy C.M., Squires K., Zimmerling J.R., Estimation of spatiotemporal trends in bat abundance from mortality data collected at wind turbines, Conserv Biol, 35, 1, pp. 227-238, (2021); VIIRS stray light corrected nighttime day/night band composites version 1, Earth Engine Data Catalog, (2022); Elvidge C.D., Baugh K.E., Kihn E.A., Kroehl H.W., Davis E.R., Mapping city lights with nighttime data from the DMSP Operational Linescan System, Photogrammetr Eng Remote Sens, 63, 6, pp. 727-734, (1997); Elvidge C.D., Baugh K.E., Zhizhin M., Hsu F.-C., Why VIIRS data are superior to DMSP for mapping nighttime lights, Proc Asia-Pac Adv Netw, 35, (2013); Elvidge C.D., Baugh K., Zhizhin M., Hsu F.C., Ghosh T., VIIRS night-time lights, Int J Remote Sens, 38, 21, pp. 5860-5879, (2017); Elvidge C.D., Zhizhin M., Ghosh T., Hsu F.C., Taneja J., Annual time series of global VIIRS nighttime lights derived from monthly averages: 2012 to 2019, Remote Sens, 13, 5, pp. 1-14, (2021); How Emerging Hot Spot Analysis works—ArcGIS Pro | Documentation; Gaston K.J., Duffy J.P., Gaston S., Bennie J., Davies T.W., Human alteration of natural light cycles: causes and ecological consequences, Oecologia, 176, 4, pp. 917-931, (2014); Nighttime lights time series version 4, defense meteorological program operational linescan system (Google.com)., (2021); Holker F., Wolter C., Perkin E.K., Tockner K., Light pollution as a biodiversity threat, Trends Ecol Evol, 25, 12, pp. 681-682, (2010); Horton K.G., Nilsson C., Van Doren B.M., La Sorte F.A., Dokter A.M., Farnsworth A., Bright lights in the big cities: migratory birds’ exposure to artificial light, Front Ecol Environ, 17, 4, pp. 209-214, (2019); Ingersoll T.E., Sewall B.J., Amelon S.K., Improved analysis of long-term monitoring data demonstrates marked regional declines of bat populations in the Eastern United States, PLoS ONE, 8, 6, (2013); Kendall M.G., Gibbons J.D., Rank correlation methods, (1990); Knop E., Zoller L., Ryser R., Gerpe C., Horler M., Fontaine C., Artificial light at night as a new threat to pollination, Nature, 548, 7666, pp. 206-209, (2017); Langwig K.E., Hoyt J.R., Parise K.L., Kath J., Kirk D., Frick W.F., Foster J.T., Marm Kilpatrick A., Invasion dynamics of white-nose syndrome fungus, Midwestern United States, 2012–2014, Emerg Infect Dis, 21, 6, pp. 1023-1026, (2015); Lewanzik D., Voigt C.C., Transition from conventional to light-emitting diode street lighting changes activity of urban bats, J Appl Ecol, 54, 1, pp. 264-271, (2017); Manfrin A., Singer G., Larsen S., Weiss N., van Grunsven R.H.A., Weiss N.S., Wohlfahrt S., Monaghan M.T., Holker F., Artificial light at night affects organism flux across ecosystem boundaries and drives community structure in the recipient ecosystem, Front Environ Sci, (2017); Mann H.B., Nonparametric tests against trend, Econometrica, 13, 3, (1945); Ord J.K., Getis A., Local spatial autocorrelation statistics: distributional issues and an application, Geogr Anal, 27, 4, pp. 286-306, (1995); Pauwels J., Le Viol I., Azam C., Valet N., Julien J.F., Bas Y., Lemarchand C., Sanchez de Miguel A., Kerbiriou C., Accounting for artificial light impact on bat activity for a biodiversity-friendly urban planning, Landsc Urban Plan, 183, pp. 12-25, (2019); Rodhouse T.J., Ormsbee P.C., Irvine K.M., Vierling L.A., Szewczak J.M., Vierling K.T., Assessing the status and trend of bat populations across broad geographic regions with dynamic distribution models, Ecol Appl, 22, 4, pp. 1098-1113, (2012); Seewagen C.L., Adams A.M., Turning to the dark side: LED light at night alters the activity and species composition of a foraging bat assemblage in the northeastern United States, Ecol Evol, 11, 10, pp. 5635-5645, (2021); Spoelstra K., van Grunsven R.H.A., Ramakers J.J.C., Ferguson K.B., Raap T., Donners M., Veenendaal E.M., Visser M.E., Response of bats to light with different spectra: light-shy and agile bat presence is affected by white and green, but not red light, Proc R Soc B, (2017); Stone E.L., Jones G., Harris S., Conserving energy at a cost to biodiversity?

Therefore, identifying individual, household and place characteristics (demographic, political, social, economic, and ecological) related to this process is crucial for understanding the drivers of tropical deforestation. This will in turn be useful for developing policies to reduce deforestation, which cannot be approached only from the destination end since this ignores the fundamental role played by migrant farmers advancing the agricultural frontier. This paper uses data from surveys conducted in areas of high out-migration, much to the agricultural frontier in northern Guatemala. Results suggest that larger family sizes, land scarcity, soil degradation, poor access to markets, low education, and poverty are linked to migration to the frontier in Guatemala. © Association of European Geographers.","Agriculture; Conservation; Frontier settlement; Land use; Migration","","","","","","","","Adamo S.B., Environmental migration and cities in the context of global environmental change, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 2, 3, pp. 161-165, (2010); Aguayo S., Christensen H., O' Dogherty L., Varese S., Social and Cultural Conditions and Prospects of Guatemalan Refugees in Mexico, (1987); Almeida A., The Colonization of the Amazon, (1992); Barbier E., The economic determinants of land degradation in developing countries.""

It is likely, however, that most people experience climate change in situ, so understanding the role of population dynamics remains critical. How a given number of people, in a given location and with varying population characteristics may exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change or how, conversely, they may be vulnerable to climate change impacts are basic questions that remain largely unresolved [6]. This paper explores where and to what extent population dynamics intersect with high exposure to climate change. Specifically, in Eastern Africa's Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), a climate change/health vulnerability hotspot we have identified in prior research [7], we model child undernutrition vulnerability indices based on climate variables, including proxy measures (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery, at a 5-km spatial resolution. Results suggest that vegetation changes associated with precipitation decline in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa can help predict deteriorating child health. © 2016 IEEE.","Climate; Lake Victoria Basin (LVB); NDVI; stunting; undernutrition; vulnerability","East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; Climate models; Dynamics; Lakes; Population dynamics; Satellite imagery; Surveys; Climate change impact; Complex relationships; Population characteristics; Precipitation data; Socioeconomic aspects; Spatial resolution; Sub-saharan africa; Vulnerability index; child health; climate effect; health survey; NDVI; nutritional status; population dynamics; precipitation assessment; spatial analysis; vulnerability; Climate change","","","","","","","Waterlow J.C., Introduction.

We used data from the Uganda National Panel Survey from 2009 to 2012 (n = 3,223 children contributing 5,013 assessments) to evaluate the link between rainfall and undernutrition in children under age 5 years. We considered 3 outcomes (underweight, wasting, and stunting) and measured precipitation using household-reported drought and deviations from long-term precipitation trends measured by satellite. We specified multilevel logistic regression models with random effects for the community, village, and individual. Underweight (13%), wasting (4%), and stunting (33%) were common. Reported drought was associated with underweight (marginal risk ratio (RR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.35) in adjusted analyses. Positive annual deviations (greater rainfall) from long-term precipitation trends were protective against underweight (marginal RR per 50-mm increase = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.97) and wasting (marginal RR per 50-mm increase = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.98) but not stunting (marginal RR per 50-mm increase = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.01). Precipitation was associated with measures of acute but not chronic malnutrition using both objective and subjective measures of exposure. Sudden reductions in rainfall are likely to have acute adverse effects on child nutritional status. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.","child health; droughts; Uganda; undernutrition","Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena;

This paper proposes an alternative classification scheme for urban mapping based on a gradient approach for the southern portion of the West African country of Ghana. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM. +) and European Remote Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are used to generate a pattern based definition of the urban context. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is used to classify a Landsat scene into Built, Vegetation and Other land covers. Landscape metrics are estimated for Built and Vegetation land covers for a 450 m uniform grid covering the study area. A measure of texture is extracted from the SAR imagery and classified as Built/Non-built. SMA based measures of Built and Vegetation fragmentation are combined with SAR texture based Built/Non-built maps through a decision tree classifier to generate a nine class urban context map capturing the transition from unsettled land at one end of the gradient to the compact urban core at the other end. Training and testing of the decision tree classifier was done using very high spatial resolution reference imagery from Google Earth. An overall classification agreement of 77% was determined for the nine-class urban context map, with user's accuracy (commission errors) being lower than producer's accuracy (omission errors). Nine urban contexts were classified and then compared with data from the 2000 Census of Ghana. Results suggest that the urban classes appropriately differentiate areas along the urban gradient. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Landscape pattern; Urban gradient; Urban mapping","Ghana; Decision trees; Geodetic satellites; Mapping; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Urban planning; Vegetation; Decision tree classifiers; Enhanced thematic mappers; European remote sensing satellites; Landscape pattern; Spectral mixture analysis; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Urban mapping; Very high spatial resolutions; ERS; GIS; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; landscape change; mapping method; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; urban area; urban growth; Urban growth","","","","","National Aeronautic and Space Administration Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science Program, (G00009708); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This research was funded by grant number R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and by National Aeronautic and Space Administration Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science Program grant G00009708 .

The purpose of this research is to quantify the effect of Iran’s Forest Nationalization Law (FNL) in a part of Zagros Forest over a 68-year time period (1955–2022) using 1955 historical aerial photos, 1968 Corona spy satellite photography, and classification of multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. A past classification change detection technique was used to identify the extent and the pattern of land use changes in time. For this purpose, six periods were defined, to cover the time before and after the implementation of FNL. A 0.27% deforestation trend was identified over the period after the FNL. Dense and open forested area has decreased from 7175.62 ha and 68,927.46 ha in 1955 to 5664.26 ha and 59,223.38 ha in 2022. The FNL brought decisive changes in the legal and forest management systems at the state level, mainly by giving their ownership to the state. Accordingly, the FNL and the related conservation plans have not fully succeeded in protecting, rehabilitating, recovering, and developing the sparse Zagros Forest ecosystems, as their most important goals. © 2023 by the authors.","change detection; conservation policies; declassified satellite photography; Google Earth Engine; historical aerial photos; machine learning","Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Iran; Quercus; Aerial photography; Antennas; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Land use; Satellite imagery; Aerial photos; Case-studies; Change detection; Conservation policy; Declassified satellite photography; Forest cover change; Google earth engine; Google earths; Historical aerial photo; Machine-learning; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; Iran; oak; procedures; Deforestation","","","","","","","Adhikari S., Southworth J., Simulating forest cover changes of Bannerghatta National Park based on a CA-Markov model: A remote sensing approach, Remote Sens, 4, pp. 3215-3243, (2012); Verburg P.H., De Koning G., Kok K., Veldkamp A., Bouma J., A spatial explicit allocation procedure for modelling the pattern of land use change based upon actual land use, Ecol.

The Mexicali Valley overlies the Mexican part of the aquifer, and the Imperial Valley the aquifer’s portion north of the Mexico–U.S. border. Mexico receives an annual water allocation from the Colorado River stipulated by an international treaty between Mexico and the United States. The Colorado River water allocation to Mexico is shared by farmers in the Mexicali Valley and by several border cities, rural communities, and industries in the northern region of the State of Baja California. Farmers withdraw groundwater from the Mexicali Valley’s aquifer to make up for insufficient Colorado River water to grow their crops. Groundwater withdrawal has created overdraft of the Mexicali Valley aquifer with associated adverse impacts: sea water intrusion, declining groundwater levels, upwelling of brackish groundwater, land subsidence, degradation of groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and emigration of displaced farmers. This article reviews the natural and human histories in the Colorado River basin and the Mexicali Valley, and presents a methodology applying remote sensing, geographic information analysis, and hydrologic analysis to calculate the annual water deficit in the Mexicali Valley. Finally, this work evaluates the valley’s annual water deficit in reference to current agricultural and socioeconomic trends observed in the study region. Aquifer and related environmental degradation have adversely affected small-scale farming and exacerbated demographic instability. © 2023 by American Association of Geographers.","","","","","","","","","Alles D.L., (2011); Almaraz A., Cotton in the Mexicali Valley and the limits of state interventionism (1914–1950), Apuntes 77, 42, 77, pp. 129-159, (2015); Belknap B., Evans L.B., Grand Canyon river guide, (2021); Brown R.L., The great Pikes Peak gold rush, (1985); Brun L., Abdulsamad A., Geurtsen G., Gereffi G., Agricultural value chains in the Mexicali Valley of Mexico, (2010); Castle S.L., Thomas B.F., Reager J.T., Rodell M., Swenson S.C., Famiglietti J.S., Future water security of the Colorado River Basin, Geophysical Research Letters, 41, 16, pp. 5904-5911, (2014); Cohen M.J., Henges-Jeck C., Castillo-Moreno G., A preliminary water balance for the Colorado River delta, 1992–1998, Journal of Arid Environments, 49, 1, pp. 35-48, (2001); (2015); (2015); Cooper J.D., Miller R.H., Patterson J., A trip through time: Principles of historical geology, (1987); Cruz-Ayala M.B., Megdal S.B., An overview of managed aquifer recharge in Mexico and its legal framework, Water, 12, 2, (2020); Faret L., Les territoires de la mobilité: Migration et communautés transnationales entre Mexique et les États Unis, (2009); Glenn E.P., Zamora-Arroyo F., Nagler P.L., Briggs M., Shaw W., Flessa K., Ecology and conservation biology of the Colorado River delta, Journal of Arid Environments, 49, 1, pp. 5-15, (2001); Gonzalez-Olimon G., Santiago-Serrano E., Restaurando el delta del Río Colorado, (2017); Gordon A.J., Geologic guide to the Grand Canyon National Park, (2000); Gray S.T., Graumlich L.J., Betancourt J.L., Pederson G.T., A tree-ring based reconstruction of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation since 1567 A.D, Geophysical Research Letters, 31, 12, (2004); Hao P., Wang L., Niu Z., Comparison of hybrid classifiers for crop classification using normalized difference vegetation index time series: A case study for major crops in north Xinjiang, China, PLoS ONE, 10, 9, (2015); Hundley N., Water and the West: The Colorado River Compact and the politics of water in the American West, (1975); (2011); Masson-Delmotte V., Zhai P., Pirani A., Connors S.L., Pean C., Berger S., Caud N., Chen Y., Goldfarb L., Gomis M.I., Et al., Climate change 2021: The physical science basis.

However, the impacts, processes, and pattern characteristic of the World Cup on UGS have not yet been fully understood. To fill this gap, we employ time-series satellite imagery and compute the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) across detailed maps of UGS in Qatar from 2000 to 2022. In our quantitative assessment, we investigate UGS coverage, landscape patterns, and exposure both before and after the World Cup. Additionally, we compile seven instances of greening in Qatar, and compare them with greening processes in three cities located in neighboring countries. This contextual analysis aims to unravel the nuanced impact of the World Cup on UGS in Qatar. Our results demonstrate: (1) The World Cup emerges as a significant contributor to UGS growth, with UGS expansion accounting for 94.3% of the overall increase in the built-up area during the tournament. This surge in growth is equivalent to an additional area equivalent to 38 Manhattan Central Parks. (2) The World Cup induces a transformation in UGS landscapes, rendering them more complex and fragmented. The degree of change in the landscape index within the built-up area is 35 times greater than those changes observed in the pre-World Cup period. (3) The World Cup brings about a significant enhancement in the minimum level of green exposure for citizens, marking an 8.7-fold increase. This event has proven to be instrumental in propelling Qatar towards multifaceted urban greening, establishing the country as a leading model for regional greening processes.

We examine land-use outcomes of perhaps the largest government-planned rural reforestation program in the history of humankind, China’s “Grain for Green” (GFG) policy from 1999 to 2006. Specifically, we simulate household responses to the GFG policy in Western China’s Shaanxi Province, a region experiencing acute climate and land change-related environmental degradation. We develop a “farmer group decision-making model” to simulate the probability of land-use change. Elevation, slope, and farm household characteristics emerge as key factors influencing farmers’ land-use decisions and subsequent land-use patterns. Land reversion and abandonment in the study area have been significantly affected by the GFG program. Policy recommendations suggest potential avenues to enhance the effectiveness of the GFG program and to improve the efficient use of under-used farmland. Results may help inform the Chinese government as it crafts policy guiding a coupled rural migration and reforestation program of unprecedented scale. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Belief, desire and intention (BDI) model; Grain for Green program; Land abandonment; Land reversion; Policy scenarios","","","","","","State Scholar Fund of China Scholarship Council, (201206975009); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (40901093, 41271103); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (11JK0744)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41271103 and 40901093), Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China (Grant No. 11JK0744), and State Scholar Fund of China Scholarship Council (201206975009).

However, the degree to which these goals are met depends, in part, on accessibility and desirability of programs targeting rural communities and smallholders. Empirical research on factors motivating or dissuading PES landowner participation remains limited and a more complete understanding of these factors is critical to improving PES social equity outcomes. In this paper, we evaluate factors facilitating and constraining participation in Ecuador's SocioPáramo program, a recently launched PES initiative targeting highland Andean grasslands (páramos). We conducted semi-structured interviews with all community landowner participants who had enrolled by May 2011, the majority of individual landowner participants who had enrolled by October 2010, and several non-participant communities and individuals. We found that, while SocioPáramo is attracting substantial participation among rural farmers and communities, a number of factors, including land tenure requirements, legal or biophysical land-use restrictions, and a need for pre-existing social, human, and financial capital, make SocioPáramo more accessible and desirable to larger, and often wealthier, landowners. While motivations for enrolling in the program varied, a key similarity among participants was access to alternative livelihood sources, a low opportunity cost associated with program land-use regulations, and a high value placed on the water provisioning services of the páramo. The majority of participants described incentives as a ""reward"" for conserving, as a means to strengthen existing conservation efforts or land security, or as a means to compensate for legal or biophysical land use restrictions. Our results suggest that the broader context of land tenure security, access to social capital, environmental attitudes, and alternative livelihood strategy development may require more attention in order to achieve greater participation among rural smallholders and communities. These results provide useful lessons for developing and adapting this and other PES programs so that they can better meet social goals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation; Ecuador; Páramo; Payment for ecosystem services (PES); Poverty alleviation; SocioPáramo","Ecuador; ecosystem service; land cover; land tenure; landowner; poverty alleviation; rural development; rural society; smallholder; strategic approach","","","","","CNH, (EF 0709627); Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems; SDSU University; National Science Foundation, NSF, (0851532)","This study would not have been possible without the support, patience, and enthusiasm of many people.

Indeed, little work has been done to advance the frameworks and methods needed to assess, measure, and communicate the potential negative socioeconomic impact of MPAs and incorporate this information in MPA planning and management efforts. To address this gap, we test a vulnerability assessment termed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) that is designed to measure the relative potential impact a proposed MPA network may have upon fisherman livelihoods. To test the LVI, specifically we ask, how does the vulnerability of fishermen to the impact of MPAs differ across place? We explore this question through two core areas of inquiry surrounding the study of vulnerability assessments: 1) Ranking and comparing vulnerability and 2) Explaining attributes of vulnerability. Through this study we demonstrate how the historical and current conditions fishermen experience in a given place shape vulnerability levels in various ways. Variability in the attributes of a particular place such as weather conditions, the size of fishing areas, availability of alternative fisheries, and changes in kelp cover contribute inherently as measures of vulnerability but they also shape fishermen perceptions of what are important measures of vulnerability. Secondly, counter to existing notions, the use of weights in vulnerability assessments may not significantly impact vulnerability scores and ranking. Together these findings emphasize the need to test vulnerability assessments against actual experienced impact or harm across geographies and groups of fishermen towards an informed refinement of vulnerability assessments. We emphasize that the particularities of place are critical to understand, to appropriately assess and thus to effectively mitigate vulnerability in order to promote the future well being of fisherman livelihoods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Fishermen; Fishing; Marine protected areas; Sea urchin; Socioeconomic; Vulnerability","Echinoidea; echinoderm; fishing community; marine park; socioeconomic impact; vulnerability","","","","","University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB","Funding for this research was provided by the University of California, Santa Barbara and Ecotrust .

A key goal in establishing marine protected areas is to maximize conservation benefits while minimizing the potential negative impacts to local fishing communities. However, current impact analyses largely assume a linear relationship between percent of fishing area or revenue lost with the magnitude of impact to fishermen. The LVI described in this paper aims to provide an additional dimension to impact analyses in which the adaptive capacity of individual fishermen is examined to estimate the differential abilities of fishermen to cope with the loss of fishing areas or revenue. This paper advances vulnerability assessments as it develops a novel framework for identifying and measuring drivers of vulnerability for understudied fishing populations whose livelihoods depend upon marine resources. This vulnerability assessment is intended to inform the design of marine protected areas by enabling researchers to incorporate the adaptive capacity of fishermen into socioeconomic impact analyses. The LVI was developed for the California commercial sea urchin fishery in the context of proposed marine protected area networks develop through the California Marine Life Protected Act planning process. As climate change advances there is an increasing need to identify vulnerable and resilient populations and ways to bolster adaptive capacity given the environmental and economic changes ahead. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adaptive capacity; Fishermen; Marine protected areas; Marine spatial planning; Sea urchin; Vulnerability","California; United States; Echinoidea; Conservation; Economics; Environmental protection; Fisheries; Mammals; Marine biology; Shellfish; Adaptive capacity; Fishermen; Marine protected area; Marine Spatial Planning; Sea urchin; Vulnerability; climate change; echinoderm; ecosystem resilience; marine resource; protected area; socioeconomic impact; spatial planning; vulnerability; Climate change","","","","","University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB","Acknowledgments Funding for this research was provided by the University of California, Santa Barbara and Ecotrust.

However, when such synergies exist, the situation of small-scale farmers is often overlooked, and they are unable to implement new practices and technologies. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to improve CSA by adding the neglected but very important element “small-scale farmer”, and introduce Vulnerable-Smart Agriculture (VSA) as a complete version of CSA. VSA indicates, based on the results of this study, that none of the decisions made by policymakers can be realistic and functional as long as the voice of the farmers influenced by their decisions is not heard. Therefore, to identify different levels for possible interventions and develop VSA monitoring indicators, a new conceptual framework needs to be developed. This study proposed such a framework consisting of five elements: prediction of critical incidents by farmers, measuring the consequences of incidents, identifying farmers' coping strategies, assessing farmers' livelihood capital when facing an incident, and adapting to climate incidents. The primary focus of this study is on farmers’ learning and operational preparation to deal with tension and disasters at farm level. Understanding the implications of threats from climate change and the recognizing of coping mechanisms will contribute to an increase in understanding sustainable management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Food security; Small-scale farming; Sustainable livelihood; Vulnerability","Climate change; Food supply; Sustainable development; Food security; Impact on the environment; Policy makers; Rural livelihood; Security problems; Small scale farmers; Small scale farming; Smart agricultures; Sustainable livelihood; Vulnerability; Agriculture","","","","","Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (2021VCA0004, XDA20060303)","This research paper was partly funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA20060303 ) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences President’s International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI grant no. 2021VCA0004 ).","Abegunde V.O., Sibanda M., Obi A., The dynamics of climate change adaptation in sub-saharan Africa: a review of climate-smart agriculture among small-scale farmers, Climate, 7, (2019); Abson D.J., Dougill A.J., Stringer L.C., Using principal component analysis forinformation-rich socio-ecological vulnerability mapping in Southern Africa, Appl.

While there are many reasons for the fact that fertility decline is slow in Africa, we hypothesize that the relationship between fertility and urbanization is obscured by the fact that urbanization takes place along a gradient. In the most urban places (e.g., neighborhoods of the largest cities), fertility is apt to be very low, but most urban residents are residing in places that are somewhere along a continuum from completely rural to the most urban possible. All previous attempts to define that urban gradient and relate it to fertility levels rely in one form or another on census data. Because sub-Saharan-African countries are among the least prolific in terms of census gathering, a measure that relies solely on satellite imagery to gage a place's position along the urban gradient could be extremely useful. This paper describes a methodology for doing this and then uses data from the West African country of Ghana to examine how spatial patterns of land cover are associated with fertility. Satellite imagery and landscape metrics are used to create an urban context definition based on landscape patterns using a gradient approach. Census data are used to model the association between urban context and fertility through ordinary least square regression and spatial autoregressive models. Results indicate that there are significant differences in fertility between different urban contexts.

Migration intention is critical to the effectiveness of ecological migration policy. However, studies on migration intention in relation to ecological migration policy in China remain scant. Thus this paper aims to investigate the rural residents' migration intentions and their affecting factors under ecological migration policy in Minqin County, an ecological restoration area, located at the lower terminus of Shiyang River Basin in arid Northwest China. The data for this study come from a randomly sampled household questionnaire survey. Results from logistic regression modelling indicate that most residents do not intend to migrate, despite rigid eco-environmental conditions and governance polices threatening livelihood sustainability. In addition to demographic and socio-economic factors, the eco-environmental factors are also significantly correlated with the possibility of a resident intending to migrate. The implications of the significant independent variables for the sustainability of ecological migration policy are discussed. The paper concludes that ecological migration policies may ultimately be more sustainable when taking into account household interests within complex migration intention contexts, such as household livelihoods dynamics and environmental change. © 2014 by the authors.","Arid northwest china; Ecological migration policy; Ecological restoration area; Migration intentions; Policy sustainability; Sustainable livelihood","China; Gansu; Minqin; arid region; demography; household survey; migration; policy implementation; questionnaire survey; regression analysis; resident population; restoration ecology; rural planning; rural population; socioeconomic indicator; sustainability","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, (11BSH059)","","(2013); Wang Z., Song K., Hu L., China's largest scale ecological migration in the three-river headwater region, Ambio, 39, pp. 443-446, (2010); Zhang L., Liu J., Key issues of ecological migration in northern deserted areas of China, Chinese J.

But what environmental factors may contribute to these migration streams in the first place? Identification of the environmental characteristics related to this process is crucial for understanding how environmental change and migration may form recurrent feedback loops. Further understanding of this process could be useful for developing policies to both reduce environmentally induced migration from origin areas and also palliate significant environmental change unleashed by settler deforestation in destination areas. Evidently, apprehension of this holistic process cannot be approached only from the destination since this ignores environmental and other antecedents to rural out-migration. This letter presents data from surveys conducted in areas of high out-migration to the agricultural frontier in northern Guatemala. The results suggest that land scarcity and degradation in origin communities are linked to out-migration in general and to the forest frontier of northern Guatemala in particular. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Deforestation; Ecology; Guatemala; Tropical Atmospheres; Guatemala [Central America]; Maya Biosphere Reserve; Peten; Biosphere reserve; Environmental change; Environmental characteristic; Environmental factors; Feed-back loop; Guatemala; Land scarcity; Soil degradation; agroecology; deforestation; development strategy; environmental change; environmental factor; population migration; rural-urban migration; soil degradation; tropical region; Deforestation","","","","","","","Adamo S.B., Environmental migration and cities in the context of global environmental change, Curr.

Here we provide support for the hypothesis that agricultural development and fertilizer use in West Africa increase the burden of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis by fuelling the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation that chokes out water access points and serves as habitat for freshwater snails that transmit Schistosoma parasites to more than 200 million people globally8–10. In a cluster randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03187366) in which we removed invasive submerged vegetation from water points at 8 of 16 villages (that is, clusters), control sites had 1.46 times higher intestinal Schistosoma infection rates in schoolchildren and lower open water access than removal sites. Vegetation removal did not have any detectable long-term adverse effects on local water quality or freshwater biodiversity. In feeding trials, the removed vegetation was as effective as traditional livestock feed but 41 to 179 times cheaper and converting the vegetation to compost provided private crop production and total (public health plus crop production benefits) benefit-to-cost ratios as high as 4.0 and 8.8, respectively. Thus, the approach yielded an economic incentive—with important public health co-benefits—to maintain cleared waterways and return nutrients captured in aquatic plants back to agriculture with promise of breaking poverty–disease traps. To facilitate targeting and scaling of the intervention, we lay the foundation for using remote sensing technology to detect snail habitats. By offering a rare, profitable, win–win approach to addressing food and water access, poverty alleviation, infectious disease control and environmental sustainability, we hope to inspire the interdisciplinary search for planetary health solutions11 to the many and formidable, co-dependent global grand challenges of the twenty-first century. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Africa; Agriculture; Animals; Child; Ecosystem; Humans; Schistosomiasis; Snails; West Africa; fertilizer; praziquantel; agricultural development; compost; crop production; disease control; infectious disease; innovation; livestock; remote sensing; schistosomiasis; submerged vegetation; water quality; adult; Africa; agricultural land; agricultural management; Article; biodiversity; child; cohort analysis; compost; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; crop production; cross-sectional study; disease burden; economic incentive; environmental sustainability; female; fertilizer application; food access; freshwater environment; human; infection control; infection rate; intestinal schistosomiasis; land use; livestock; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nonhuman; planetary health; poverty; public health; randomized controlled trial; remote sensing; schistosomiasis; school child; snail; species habitat; vegetation; waste component removal; water contamination; water quality; water supply; Africa; agriculture; animal; ecosystem; parasitology; schistosomiasis","","praziquantel, 55268-74-1","","","CNH, (1414102, R01 TW010286-01); SNAP-NCEAS; Stanford GDP SEED, (1183573-100-GDPAO); National Science Foundation, NSF, (DEB-2011179, DEB-2017785, DEB-2109293, EF-1241889, ICER-2024383, R01 TW010286); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01GM109499); Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, CTSI, (EAR-1360330, EAR-1646708, K01AI091864)","The authors thank the people of Senegal who invited us into their communities to co-develop the research in this Article.

However, dams may also disrupt traditional livelihood systems and increase the transmission of vector-and water-borne pathogens. These livelihood and health impacts diminish the benefits of dams to rural populations dependent on rivers, as hydrological and ecological alterations change flood regimes, reduce nutrient transport and lead to the loss of biodiversity. We propose four agricultural innovations for promoting equity, health, sustainable development, and climate resilience in dammed watersheds: (1) restoring migratory aquatic species, (2) removing submerged vegetation and transforming it into an agricultural resource, (3) restoring environmental flows and (4) integrating agriculture and aquaculture. As investment in dams accelerates in low-and middle-income countries, appropriately addressing their livelihood and health impacts can improve the sustainability of modern agriculture and economic development in a changing climate. © 2021 by the authors.

Inefficient land suitability leads to inefficient exploitation of natural resources, destruction of land resources, poverty, and even social harm. In this regard, land suitability assessment is important to support transportation planning and demand for construction. This study aimed to systematically review the mutual impacts of land logistics and land suitability. This study applied a meta-analysis to integrate the results of 36 original papers published between 1990 and 2024. The findings showed there were mutual impacts of land logistics and land suitability. In this regard, demand for highway construction significantly affects warehousing (B = 6.30; p < 0.99) and distribution and transportation (B = 4.23; p < 0.99) according to Table 3. In addition, warehousing (B = 7.35; p < 0.95) and distribution and transportation (B = 2.11; p < 0.90) have significant effects on demand for highway construction based on Table 4. The temporal effect of logistics land development has the most positive influence on natural resources and environmental tolerance (4.49). The spatial effects of land suitability and food logistic providers have respectively the most positive impacts on inventory control and demand for highway construction in European countries. Policymakers should consider the global issue of land suitability according to its advantages. First, the greatest advantage of land suitability is that it gives more accountability to the officials and decision makers. Second, land suitability provides the basis for distribution and transportation and inventory control effectively controls storage costs. Thirdly, warehousing, due to land suitability, ensures a regular supply of goods in the market. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","construction; development restrictions; highway construction; natural resources and environmental tolerance;

But water is increasingly central to explaining environmental migration in the context of climate change. Most studies of the relationship between water and environmental migration are framed around punctuated, extreme weather events and disasters that either limit agricultural or livestock productivity or make a community physically unlivable. The chronic experiences of household water insecurity and poor water governance also shape migration decision-making through a variety of social, political, and economic factors, but these relationships have received considerably less attention. This article provides an overview of punctuated and chronic water-related triggers of environmental migration at the household level. We also offer a conceptual framework based on multiphasic response theory that highlights water's multiple roles in migration decision-making. We close by reflecting on key gaps in the climate-water-migration literature, identifying research questions that might help us better understand these relationships, and considering the implications for sustainable development policies that could potentially ease pressures on water-related displacement. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","climate change; displacement; extreme events; mobility; water insecurity","climate change; displacement; extreme event; migration; mobility; water supply","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (BCS‐1759972); National Science Foundation, NSF","We thank the Household Water Insecurity Experiences Research Coordination Network (HWISE RCN), funded by National Science Foundation grant number BCS‐1759972, for supporting a March 2020 workshop at the University of Miami that helped the authors develop many of the ideas in this article.

We open with an exploration of the historical connections between the study of seascapes and the emergence and development of environmental justice. We then discuss five conceptual domains—space, time, knowledge, participation in decision-making, and enforcement—in which attention to marine environments resonates with and expands environmental justice framings. Using a series of examples to illustrate how environmental justice and marine issues converge in scholarship and activism, we argue that this coming-together of concepts creates new avenues for research and inquiry. © 2019, AESS.","Climate; Environmental justice; Fishing; Marine environments; Oceans; Pollution","climate change; coastal zone; environmental change; environmental issue; environmental justice; fishing; marine environment; policy making; pollution","","","","","Andrew W.

The study used remote sensing (RS) data from Landsat TM/ETM+ and OLI images and Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud platform for obtaining the lake surface area and island information from 1987 to 2023. A modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was applied to water area extraction. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was employed to assess net shoreline movement (NSM) and depict the lake shoreline length and rate changes. Furthermore, the water level was derived by ASTER GDEM V2 using the waterline method and lake boundaries. Six climatic features (temperature, precipitation, potential and actual evaporation, aridity index, and actual water difference) were investigated to find the driving factors of lake area shrinkage by correlation and factor analysis. The results reveal that during 1987–2023, the HL area has undergone four separate phases: stable (1987–1997), shrinkage (1998–2015), growth (2016–2019), and reduction (2020–2023). The most substantial negative change (−7.45%) in the HL area was observed in 1998. NSM analysis demonstrates that the lake has experienced both expansion and shrinkage at various times and locations. According to Water Balance Method, the water volume of HL exhibited variations, ranging from −0.1895 to −0.009 km³. The average yearly change in lake volume, water level, and area displayed similar characteristics with high inconstancy. Correlation and factor analysis of lake area and climatic factors demonstrate that higher precipitation, low temperatures, less potential evaporation level, lower actual evaporation rates, and more minor differences in water levels are associated with an increase in lake area. In contrast, the opposite conditions lead to a reduction in lake size. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","And human activities; Climate change; Google earth engine (GEE); Hongjian lake; Lake area; NSM","China; Hongjiannao Lake; Shaanxi; And human activity; Correlation analysis; Factors analysis; Google earth engine; Google earths; Hongjian lake; Human activities; Lake areas; Net shoreline movement; Water areas; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate forcing; environmental monitoring; human activity; Landsat thematic mapper; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial data","","","","","King Saud University, KSU; Scientific Research Plan Projects of Shaanxi Education Department, (RSPD2024R561, YLKG-2022-10, 22JS045); State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region of China, (2019KFKT-13); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51969031, 52169006); Shaanxi Science and Technology Innovation Team, (2022TD-08)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51969031, 52169006), the Shaanxi Science and Technology Innovation Team (No. 2022TD-08), the Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region of China (No. 2019KFKT-13), the Shaanxi Key Scientific Research Plan of Education Department (No. 22JS045), and the Yulin \u2018Scientists + Engineers\u2019 Team Project (YLKG-2022-10).

Previous studies have shown a positive association between agriculture and the human infectious disease schistosomiasis, which is problematic as this parasitic disease infects approximately 250 million people worldwide. Certain insecticides might runoff fields and be highly toxic to invertebrates, such as prawns in the genus Macrobrachium, that are biocontrol agents for snails that transmit the parasites causing schistosomiasis. We used a laboratory dose-response experiment and an observational field study to determine the relative toxicities of three pyrethroid (esfenvalerate, λ-cyhalothrin, and permethrin) and three organophosphate (chlorpyrifos, malathion, and terbufos) insecticides to Macrobrachium prawns. In the lab, pyrethroids were consistently several orders of magnitude more toxic than organophosphate insecticides, and more likely to runoff fields at lethal levels according to modeling data. At 31 water contact sites in the lower basin of the Senegal River where schistosomiasis is endemic, we found that Macrobrachium prawn survival was associated with pyrethroid but not organophosphate application rates to nearby crop fields after controlling for abiotic and prawn-level factors. Our laboratory and field results suggest that widely used pyrethroid insecticides can have strong non-target effects on Macrobrachium prawns that are biocontrol agents where 400 million people are at risk of human schistosomiasis. Understanding the ecotoxicology of high-risk insecticides may help improve human health in schistosomiasis-endemic regions undergoing agricultural expansion. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Contamination; Macrobrachium; Pesticide; Prawns","Animals; Chlorpyrifos; Humans; Insecticides; Palaemonidae; Permethrin; Pyrethrins; Schistosomiasis; Senegal River; Agricultural chemicals; Biocontrol; Farms; Health risks; Molluscs; Runoff; Shellfish; insecticide; malathion; organophosphate; pyrethroid; rain; chlorpyrifos; insecticide; permethrin; pyrethroid; Africa; Biocontrol agent; Food production; Infectious disease; Macrobrachium; Organophosphate insecticides; Parasitics; Prawn; Pyrethroid insecticide; Pyrethroids; biocontrol agent; crustacean; dose-response relationship; ecotoxicology; insecticide; nontarget organism; pesticide application; pollution effect; pyrethroid pesticide; schistosomiasis; agriculture; Article; dose response; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; food industry; hazard ratio; LC50; Macrobrachium; mortality; nonhuman; schistosomiasis; shrimp farming; simulation; survival time; topography; toxicity; animal; human; Palaemonidae; parasitology; physiology; schistosomiasis; Insecticides","","malathion, 121-75-5; chlorpyrifos, 2921-88-2; permethrin, 51877-74-8, 52645-53-1; Chlorpyrifos, ; Insecticides, ; Permethrin, ; Pyrethrins, ","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1414102, DEB- 2017785, DEB- 2109293, IOS 1,754,868); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (DEB – 2011179, NSF-ICER-2024383, OPP1114050)","The household survey data were collected with support from the National Science Foundation Coupled Natural Human Systems program (grant # 1414102 ).

However, to our knowledge, no research to date examines the dual burden of COVID-19 and extreme heat on labor productivity and laborers' health and livelihoods. To close this research gap and shed light on a critical health and livelihood issue affecting a vulnerable population, we urge researchers to study the two topics in tandem. Because farmworkers have a high incidence of COVID-19 infections and a low rate of inoculation, they will be among those who suffer most from this dual burden. In this article, we discuss impacts from extreme heat and COVID-19 on farm laborers. We provide examples from the literature and a conceptual framework showing the bi-directional nature of heat impacts on COVID-19 and vice versa. We conclude with questions for further research and with specific policy recommendations to alleviate this dual burden. If implemented, these policies would enhance the wellbeing of farmworkers through improved unemployment benefits, updated regulations, and consistent implementation of outdoor labor regulations. Additionally, policies for farmworker-related health needs and cultural aspects of policy implementation and farmworker outreach are needed. These and related policies could potentially reduce the dual burden of COVID-19 and extreme heat impacts while future research explores their relative cost-effectiveness.

For schistosomiasis, exposure occurs through contact with water, which is often tied to daily activities. Water contact, however, does not imply risk unless the environmental hazard of snails and parasites is also present in the water. By increasing reliance on hazardous activities and environments, socio-economic vulnerability can hinder reductions in exposure to a hazard. We aimed to quantify the contributions of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability to the presence and intensity of Schistosoma haematobium re-infection. Methodology/Principal findings In 13 villages along the Senegal River, we collected parasitological data from 821 schoolaged children, survey data from 411 households where those children resided, and ecological data from all 24 village water access sites. We fit mixed-effects logistic and negative binomial regressions with indices of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability as explanatory variables of Schistosoma haematobium presence and intensity, respectively, controlling for demographic variables. Using multi-model inference to calculate the relative importance of each component of risk, we found that hazard (wi = 0.95) was the most important component of S. haematobium presence, followed by vulnerability (Σwi = 0.91). Exposure (Σwi = 1.00) was the most important component of S. haematobium intensity, followed by hazard (Σwi = 0.77). Model averaging quantified associations between each infection outcome and indices of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability, revealing a positive association between hazard and infection presence (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.12, 1.97), and a positive association between exposure and infection intensity (RR 2.59–3.86, depending on the category; all 95% CIs above 1) Conclusions/Significance Our findings underscore the linkages between social (exposure and vulnerability) and environmental (hazard) processes in the acquisition and accumulation of S. haematobium infection. This approach highlights the importance of implementing both social and environmental interventions to complement mass drug administration. © 2021 Lund et al.","","Adolescent; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Reinfection; Rural Population; Schistosoma haematobium; Schistosomiasis haematobia; Senegal; Social Vulnerability; Vulnerable Populations; Water; praziquantel; water; adolescent; Article; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease predisposition; explanatory variable; female; geographic distribution; hazard; household; human; infection rate; interview; intestine parasite; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mass drug administration; parental consent; preschool child; prevalence; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; reinfection; rural population; Schistosoma haematobium; schistosomiasis; schistosomiasis haematobia; school child; Senegal; social determinants of health; urine sampling; work environment; animal; genetics; isolation and purification; parasitology; physiology; psychology; reinfection; Schistosoma haematobium; schistosomiasis haematobia; vulnerable population","","praziquantel, 55268-74-1; water, 7732-18-5; Water, ","","","","","Cardona O-D, van Aalst MK, Birkmann J, Fordham M, McGregor G, Perez R, Et al., Determinants of Risk: Exposure and Vulnerability, Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation, pp. 65-108, (2012); Garchitorena A, Sokolow SH, Roche B, Ngonghala CN, Jocque M, Lund A, Et al., Disease Ecology, Health and the Environment: A framework to account for ecological and socio-economic drivers in the control of neglected tropical diseases, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 372, (2017); Johnson PTJ, de Roode JC, Fenton A., Why infectious disease research needs community ecology, Science, 349, pp. 1259504-1259504, (2015); Eisenberg JNS, Desai MA, Levy K, Bates SJ, Liang S, Naumoff K, Et al., Environmental determinants of infectious disease: A framework for tracking causal links and guiding public health research, Environmental Health Perspectives, 115, pp. 1216-1223, (2007); McClure M, Diuk-Wasser M., Reconciling the Entomological Hazard and Disease Risk in the Lyme Disease System, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, (2018); Porta M., A dictionary of epidemiology, (2015); Jones KE, Patel NG, Levy MA, Storeygard A, Balk D, Gittleman JL, Et al., Global trends in emerging infectious diseases, Nature, 451, pp. 990-993, (2008); Hosseini PR, Mills JN, Prieur-Richard A-H, Ezenwa VO, Bailly X, Rizzoli A, Et al., Does the impact of biodiversity differ between emerging and endemic pathogens?

The rangelands of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia in the East African Horn remain one of the world's most food insecure regions, yet have substantially increasing human populations predominantly dependent on pastoralist and agro-pastoralist livelihoods. We identify regions where substantial rainfall decrease between two periods interrupted by the 1998 El Nino event (1981-2012) in the East African Horn is coupled with human population density increases. Vegetation in this region is characterized by a variable mosaic of land covers, generally dominated by grasslands necessary for agro-pastoralism, interspersed by woody vegetation. Recent assessments indicate that vegetation degradation is occurring, adversely impacting fragile ecosystems and human livelihoods. Using AVHRR and MODIS vegetation products from 1981 to 2012, we observe changes in vegetation patterns and productivity over the last decade across the East African Horn. We observe vegetation browning trends in areas experiencing reduced main-growing season precipitation; these areas are also concurrently experiencing increasing population pressures. We also found that the drying precipitation patterns only partially statistically explain the vegetation browning trends, indicating that other factors such as population pressures and land use changes might be responsible for the observed declining vegetation condition. Furthermore, we show that the general vegetation browning trends persist even during years with normal rainfall conditions such as 2012, pointing to potential long-term degradation of rangelands on which approximately 10 million people depend. These findings may have implications for current and future regional food security monitoring and forecasting as well as for mitigation and adaptation strategies in a region where population is expected to continue increasing against a backdrop of drying climate trends and increased climatic variability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Livelihoods zones; MODIS; Pastoralism; Population","East Africa; adaptive management; agricultural production; AVHRR; climate conditions; climate variation; El Nino; environmental degradation; environmental monitoring; food security; grassland; growing season; MODIS; pasture; precipitation (climatology); rangeland; risk factor; shrub; temperature effect","","","","","CNH, (EF 0709627); National Science Foundation Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems; U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, (G09AC000001 – 385HG)","We would like to thank our funding sources, a National Science Foundation Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) ( EF 0709627 ) grant and a United States Geological Survey (USGS) Award, No. G09AC000001 – 385HG.

So far, this is the first comprehensive study to explore the sources and mechanisms of groundwater recharge applying stable environmental isotopes and hydrogeochemical properties in Southwestern Bangladesh. Water samples from the different sources (groundwater, surface (pond), river and rain water) of high arsenic (As) Holocene aquifers were used to investigate the chemical tracers and environmental stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) to explore the hydrogeological features, groundwater recharge sources, mechanisms and processes. The analytical results showed high As concentration in water samples observed 590.7 μg/L. High As groundwater was identified by a low pH value, medium HCO3 - and TDS with low concentration of NO3 - and SO4 2-. However, depleted δ2H and δ18O signatures indicated that local vertical rainfall is the key source to recharge groundwater in study area. The recharge process from pond seepage and irrigation return flow also contribute in groundwater recharge. Isotopic signatures suggested the vertical connectivity amongst the aquifers and significant vertical recharge. The reduced heavier isotope reveals extra recharging from floods of mountains and high altitude. Due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic structure of the aquifer system the spatial variability of δ2H and δ18O shows limited lateral connectivity. The combined analyses of δ2H isotope and Cl- ion showed that evaporation is the primary cause for groundwater discharge. Based on the spatial and vertical recharge processes of groundwater, present study provides a crucial baseline knowledge for establishing a sustainable groundwater management strategy. The findings from this study can guide the development of targeted groundwater management strategies and improvement of understanding the groundwater recharge sources and processes. © 2024, Chiang Mai University.

While squares in Iran have had a historical role in urban life, in recent years they have lost their place as social nodes of neighborhoods. They are losing their sustainability due to diminishing social roles in residential neighborhoods. The primary aim of this research was to investigate social sustainability dimensions in the squares of Narmak neighborhood located in the east of the metropolitan city of Tehran. The research method was descriptive, and 140 questions in seven dimensions were asked from 378 respondents aged 12+, who were selected randomly in 2018. The results showed that social sustainability variables differ in all five types of squares, particularly in terms of sense of place. However, equality was ranked on average as low in all types of squares. This study concluded that social sustainability in residential squares is very sensitive to a rapid urbanization process that has imposed mass apartment blocks, traffic flow, and lack of place identity. As a result, the process has led to social unsafety, low urban security, and weak maintenance of squares, particularly larger squares, as well as the transformation of their role as residential squares to mostly traffic squares and parking spaces. Additionally, this study concluded that small squares are socially more sustainable than larger ones because respondents felt that small squares were safer, more secure, and full of a sense of place. Urban policy-makers can use the results of the present study to evaluate the effects of their executive strategies on urban livability, social sustainability, and the satisfaction of residents. © 2023","Local squares; Policy implications; Residential satisfaction; Sense of place; Social survey; Urban development; Urbanization","Iran; Tehran [Iran]; metropolitan area; neighborhood; sense of place; sustainability; urban development; urbanization","","","","","","","Afshari H., Agnihotri S., Searcy C., Jaber M.Y., Social sustainability indicators: A comprehensive review with application in the energy sector, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 31, pp. 263-286, (2022); Ali S.S., Kaur R., Effectiveness of corporate social responsibility (csr) in implementation of social sustainability in warehousing of developing countries: A hybrid approach, Journal of Cleaner Production, 324, (2021); Azad Z., Partovi P., Comparative analysis on role of tehran's squares in promoting the collective memory of citizens, case studies: Baharestan square and tajrish square, Motaleate-Shahri), 4, pp. 1-21, (2013); Azizi M.M., Sustainable Residential Neighborhood: The Case Study of Narmak Neighborhood.

Using a systematic literature review, we identified 46 proposed solutions, which we then investigated individually using targeted literature reviews. The proposed solutions addressed diverse conservation threats and human infectious diseases, and thus, the proposed interventions varied in scale, costs, and impacts. Some potential solutions had medium-quality to high-quality evidence for previous success in achieving proposed impacts in one or both sectors. However, there were notable evidence gaps within and among solutions, highlighting opportunities for further research and adaptive implementation. Stakeholders seeking win–win interventions can explore this Review and an online database to find and tailor a relevant solution or brainstorm new solutions. © 2022 The Author(s).

This paper develops a conceptual model of factors underlying frontier agricultural expansion—the predominant driver of deforestation worldwide—from the perspective of small farm households—the majority of farmers globally. The framework consists of four causal rubrics: demographic, socioeconomic, political–economic, and ecological. Following this approach, the article explores the current state of knowledge on tropical deforestation in tropical agricultural frontiers with a focus on Latin America, the region of greatest deforestation worldwide during recent decades. Neo-Malthusian arguments notwithstanding, in many tropical nations, deforestation has proceeded unabated in recent years despite declining rural populations. However, evidence from the global-to-household scale suggests that population size and composition are also related to farm forest conversion. Existing particularist or behaviorialist theories sometimes fail to capture key geographical and temporal dimensions, yet studies support the notion that certain cultural, individual, and household characteristics are crucial determinants of forest clearing. Conversely, while institutional arguments sometimes fail to emphasize that the ultimate land use change agents are local resource users, their livelihood decisions are shaped and constrained by policies governing economic subsidies, and market and infrastructure development. Further, although ecological change is usually modeled as an outcome in the deforestation literature, increasingly acute climate change and natural farm endowments form a dynamic tabula rasa on which household land use decisions are enabled. To more fully comprehend frontier forest conversion and to enhance protection and conservation while promoting vital local livelihoods, future research may fruitfully investigate the interaction of demographic, social, political, economic, and ecological factors across spatial scales and academic disciplines. © 2021 by the author.

This essay is an overview of the population-food-environment nexus, providing recent history and statistics on these processes at several crude scales. We include a discussion of theory, review different drivers of the population-food-environment processes, provide a global overview of population and agricultural statistics from 1970 to 2010, and discuss trends and implications for Latin America, as well as some specific multi-scale case studies.

Santa Barbara, United States","We model Central American migrant-sending household agricultural practices given labor losses and the concomitant infusion of remittances. Under the new economics of labor migration (NELM) framework, it is hypothesized that smallholder farm households invest remittance income in their land either to increase crop production or to transition to cattle ranching. We test this hypothesis by developing a combination of multivariate logistic, Poisson and beta regression techniques using Latin American Migration Project data to determine how agricultural land use change compared among migrant and non-migrant households in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Results indicate that a rise in months spent abroad and remittances returned do not translate into a higher percentage of farm sales, intensification or transition to cattle ranching - counter to NELM. However, farmers are investing remittances to increase row crop and pasture land holdings. These findings suggest remittance investments in quantitative increase rather than qualitative change in land use practices. Given the expansive land demands supporting low intensity smallholder agriculture and cattle, and the land degradation cattle precipitate particularly, the trend does not augur well for the sustainability of rural landscapes increasingly transformed by international remittances. Appropriate policies to champion coupled human-land system sustainability in Central America might usefully consider viable land use alternatives to remittance investments dedicated to crop and pasture expansion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Cattle ranching; Central America; New economics of labor migration; Remittances; Smallholder farming","Costa Rica; El Salvador [Central America]; Guatemala [Central America]; Latin America; cattle; decision making; labor migration; land use change; migrants remittance; multivariate analysis; ranching; smallholder","","","","","Department of Education; National Science Foundation's Coupled Natural and Human Systems, (EF 0709627); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (K99 HD049008); National Institutes of Health, NIH; Association of American Geographers, AAG","This research was supported by a Jacob K.

Scope and approach: This study aimed to examine whether climate-smart agriculture can enhance adaptation to climate change impacts and achieve food security. To fulfill this purpose, 180 agricultural specialists from Mazandaran Province, Iran, were chosen using the proportional stratified random selection approach, and a structured questionnaire was used to gauge their perspectives. Key findings and conclusions: The results showed that innovation, investment, and supportive institutions would be crucial in encouraging the use of climate-smart agriculture. Moreover, this study underscored the importance of improving farmers' awareness of the benefits of agricultural insurance. Enhancing insurance services specifically tailored to agricultural needs, both by the public and private sectors can significantly promote the adoption and implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices. Climate-smart agriculture may considerably increase food security by serving as a mediator between climate change adaptation and food security. It is indispensable to prepare the agricultural sectors in order to rapidly change the environmental landscape, utilize new technologies, increase the investment of public and private institutions, and provide more government support for climate-smart farming methods. The findings of this study could be employed to design suitable policies, investments, and institutional measures needed to properly monitor climate-smart agriculture and achieve food security. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural productivity; Climate crises; Food safety; Mitigation; Risks and responses; Vulnerability","Agricultural productivity; Climate change adaptation; Climate crisis; Food security; Food-safety; Mazandaran provinces; Mitigation; Risk and response; Smart agricultures; Vulnerability; Food security","","","","","Ministry of Education, Science and Sports of the Republic of Lithuania and Research Council of Lithuania; LMTLT, (S-A-UEI-23-14)","Under the current realities of CC, CSA is a strategy for altering and reorienting agricultural systems to support food security. CSA strives to induce biodiversity, efficiency, self-sufficiency, self-regulation, and self-reliance in agricultural systems by combining plants, livestock, and crops. Enhancing pest and disease management, water, and nutrient management, as well as landscape, grassland, and forest management, are additional elements that can enhance adaptability and reduce the risk of food insecurity (Fig. 1) (Partey et al., 2018; Thornton et al., 2014).

Thus, this study unravels consumer segments, their preferences, and socio-economic composition so that stakeholders in Pakistan’s mandarin (locally known as Kinnow) industry can improve their practices and supply consumers’ desired quality. Primary data were collected through an intercept survey of 540 mandarin consumers in four major cities of Pakistan. Collected data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis, Mean ANOVA, and Post-Hoc tests for consumer segmentation and profiling. The study classified consumers into three groups: ‘value seekers’ (45.74%), ‘Kinnow lovers’ (26.85%), and ‘perfectionists’ (27.41%) related to their choice of various attributes of fresh mandarin fruits. The three segments significantly differed in their preferences for quality attributes, consumption and purchase preferences, and socio-economic composition. The study highlights the implications of understanding consumer preferences and market segmentation for private and public stakeholders in the mandarin industry. The existence of consumer segments with distinct quality preferences urges value chain actors to upgrade and align their practices with consumer requirements. The study findings provide insights for deciding relevant crop/cultivar mix with due consideration to geographically distinct consumer segments and land suitability. The findings may also be useful to relevant public-sector institutions in developing policies and programs for the development of the horticultural industries in Pakistan. © 2023 by the authors.","agri-food industry; consumer value; consumption preferences; land suitability; mandarin; segmentation; value chain","Pakistan; agroindustry; consumption behavior; cultivar; developing world; food industry; food safety; food security; fruit production; horticulture; industrial development; institutional framework; land use; market conditions; preference behavior; public sector; relocation; stakeholder","","","","","Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR, (C2016/197); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR","This research was funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) grant number C2016/197, 2017.","The Role of Consumer Preferences in Agricultural Production Practices from the Perspective of Food Health and safety.

However, few studies have considered future land use/cover change (LUCC) and urban sprawl in identifying KENPRA for ESP maintenance. To optimize KENPRA, we took Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, China as a case study area, a typical unit for Chinese Land Spatial Planning and a suburb of Yangtze River Delta agglomeration challenging LUCC and ecological security pattern maintenance. A comprehensive framework for optimizing KENPRA has been established by integrating ESP and land use conflict (LUC) to adapt to land use change for corresponding urbanization processes. A CA-Markov model was used to predict future land use under different KENPRA-based scenarios in 2030. The results found that the total area of 4,357.2 ha priority restoration areas and 17 key ecological nodes was KENPRA, which were approximately 50% and concentrated in intensive LUC areas. The result of the simulation model showed that KENPRA-based scenarios integrating LUC indicated less urban expansion and better effectiveness for maintaining ESPs in 2030. The findings and proposed framework provide new and important information and implications for planners and policymakers to understand and improve land planning/policy; the results also can provide better understanding of the coupled human–nature system linking LUCC, ecosystem services, and land and restoration planning.

Migration to Petén since the 1950s has eliminated 60% of Petén's forests. We analyze panel-data consisting of household interviews conducted with subsistence farmers living in the SLNP or its buffer zone in 1998 and 2009: 247 household interviews in eight communities in 1998, and repeat interviews conducted in 2009 when present. In the intervening 11 years, there has been substantial consolidation and splintering of the 1998 farm parcels. Half of the landowning households in 1998 sold land by 2009. The most commonly cited reason for a household to sell its land is for payments related to a medical emergency or debt. Regression analysis suggests early adopters of cattle and higher value crops were less likely to have sold their land by 2009. © Association of European Geographers.","Cattle; Guatemala; Hollow frontier;

We explored landscape structures and dynamics between 2000 and 2010 in Shaanxi Province, the Chinese province with the greatest amount of cropland conversion and reforestation in recent decades. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-derived data and landscape metrics for six land cover classes to determine (1) the major land cover changes during enforcement of the policy, (2) the spatial and temporal variations in these changes, and (3) the effects of land cover changes on landscape structure and dynamics. The results suggested that provincial-level land cover changes modestly reflected the goals of the GFG. Over the 10-year study period, the forest and grassland coverages expanded from 95,737.9 to 97,017.4 km2 and from 37,235.9 to 40,613.1 km2, respectively, while the cropland coverage decreased from 59,222.8 to 54,007.6 km2. The conversion direction differed regionally: the targeted croplands in Shanbei, namely, types III and IV, were mainly transformed into grassland while those in Shannan were mainly transformed into forestland. Reforestation was associated with increased inter-landscape aggregation and connection. Despite this large-scale reforestation trend, we found notable and significant differences in the land cover changes at the subprovincial level. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Grain for Green (GFG) policy; Land cover change; Payment for environmental/ecosystem services (PES); Shaanxi Province","Agriculture; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Forestry; Forests; Government Programs; Grassland; China; Shaanxi; Forestry; Reforestation; Forest and grassland; Grain for greens; Land-cover change; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Landscape structures; Payment for environmental/ecosystem services (PES); Shaanxi Province; Spatial and temporal variation; alternative agriculture; environmental economics; forest cover; grassland; land cover; land use change; landscape change; policy implementation; reforestation; satellite data; Article; China; cropland; dynamics; environmental change; environmental management; environmental planning; forest management; grassland; land use; landscape ecology; reforestation; rural area; agriculture; crop; economics; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; forestry; government; growth, development and aging; procedures; trends; Geomorphology","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, (40901093, 41271103)","","Aide T.M., Clark M.L., Grau H.R., Carr D.L., Deforestation and reforestation of Latin America and the Caribbean (2001-2010), Biotropica, 45, 2, pp. 262-271, (2013); Alo C.A., Pontius R.G., Identifying systematic land-cover transitions using remote sensing and GIS: the fate of forest inside and outside protects areas of Southwestern Ghana, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 35, 2, pp. 280-295, (2008); Anderson J.R., Hardy E.E., Roach J.T., Witmer W.E., A land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensing data.

In this study we examine how Water User Associations in the Eastern Andes of Colombia perceive water scarcity and the relationship between this perception and observed climate, land use, and demographic changes. Results demonstrate a complex relationship between perceptions and observed changes. On the one hand, observed changes in land cover match perceptions of deforestation as the primary cause of increasing water scarcity. On the other hand, perceptions of climate driven changes in water availability are not reflected in observed precipitation data. Furthermore, water scarcity was perceived in regions where seasonal rainfall variability is higher but not in regions where annual rainfall is lower. We discuss how these results contribute to our understanding of adaptation to climate change and the implications of possible mismatches between environmental changes and local perceptions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptation; Andes; Climate change; Community-based water management; Latin America; Perceptions","Andes; Colombia; climate change; community resource management; deforestation; environmental change; land cover; land use change; local adaptation; local participation; perception; socioeconomic conditions; water availability; water management; water supply","","","","","DDIG, (0926584); National Science Foundation, NSF; Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center, University of California Santa Barbara, SSLEEC; Inter-American Foundation, IAF","Acknowledgments This research would not have been possible without the support of National Science Foundation (DDIG# 0926584), Inter-American Foundation, Proyecto Páramo Andino and University California Santa Barbara.

However, little is known about the specific impact of the pandemic on agriculture and food production workers in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess the mental health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among avocado farmworkers in Michoacan, Mexico. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult farmworkers (n = 395) in May 2021. We collected survey data, nasal swabs and saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, and blood samples for immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity measurements. Results: None of the farmworkers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, among unvaccinated farmworkers (n = 336, 85%), approximately one-third (33%) showed evidence of past infection (positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2). Unvaccinated farmworkers who lived with other farmworkers (aRR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.05), had ever lived with someone with COVID-19 (aRR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.43), and who had diabetes (aRR = 2.19; 95% CI: 1.53, 2.85) had a higher risk of testing IgG-positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, unvaccinated farmworkers living in more rural areas (outside of Tingambato or Uruapan) (aRR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.96) or cooking with wood-burning stove (aRR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.96) had a lower risk of IgG-positivity. Moreover, 66% of farmworkers reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their lives, 29% reported experiencing food insecurity and difficulty paying bills, and 10% reported depression or anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the mental health and financial well-being of avocado farmworkers. Consequently, the implementation of interventions and prevention efforts, such as providing mental health support and food assistance services, is imperative.

Places with high or growing human population as well as increasing climate variability, have a reduced ability to provide ecosystem services just as the need for these services is most critical. A spiral of vulnerability and ecosystem degradation often ensues in such places. We apply different global conservation schemes as proxies to examine the spatial relation between wet season precipitation, population change over three decades, and natural resource conservation. We pose two research questions: 1) Where are biodiversity and ecosystem services vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change and population growth? 2) Where are human populations vulnerable to degraded ecosystem services? Results suggest that globally only about 20% of the area between 50 degrees latitude North and South has experienced significant change-largely wetting-in wet season precipitation. Approximately 40% of rangelands and 30% of rainfed agriculture lands have experienced significant precipitation changes, with important implications for food security. Over recent decades a number of critical conservation areas experienced high population growth concurrent with significant wetting or drying (e.g. the Horn of Africa, Himalaya, Western Ghats, and Sri Lanka), posing challenges not only for human adaptation but also to the protection and sustenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Identifying areas of climate and population risk and their overlap with conservation priorities can help to target activities and resources that promote biodiversity and ecosystem services while improving human well-being. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

We then discuss shifts in sensibilities around marine-space, especially with concern to notions of fishing communities and their inclusion in planning and management processes. Through this, we underscore a problematic pervasive in conceptual models used to account for relations between humans and marine-spaces and how this contributes to failures to fulfill regulatory responsibilities to fishing communities. We then draw on new materialist insights into assemblages and affect and emotion to offer alternative ways to think about, research, approach, and manage marine-spaces through more nuanced and informed considerations of their broad, complex, and ever-present human and socio-cultural components. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Assemblages; Emotion and affect; Fisheries; Fisheries management; Marine-space(s); New materialism","","","","","","","","Abbott-Jamieson S., Clay P.M., The long voyage to including sociocultural analysis in NOAA's national marine fisheries service, Marine Fisheries Review, 72, 2, pp. 14-33, (2010); Agardy T., Information needs for marine protected areas: scientific and societal, Bulletin of Marine Science, 66, 3, pp. 875-888, (2000); Anderson B., McFarlane C., Assemblage and geography, Area, 43, 2, pp. 124-127, (2011); Anderson K., Smith S.J., Editorial: emotional geographies, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 26, 1, pp. 7-10, (2001); Armitage D.R., Plummer R., Berkes F., Arthur R.I., Charles A.T., Davidson-Hunt I.J., Et al., Adaptive co-management for social-ecological complexity, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 7, 2, pp. 95-102, (2008); Begossi A., Local knowledge and training towards management, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 10, 5, pp. 591-603, (2008); Linking social and ecological systems: Management practices and social mechanisms for building resilience, (2000); Berry K.A., Actor-network theory and tradtional cultural properties: exploring irrigation as a hybrid network in 19th Century Hawai'i, Human Geography, 7, 2, pp. 73-87, (2014); Bolster W.J., Opportunities in marine environmental history, Environmental History, 11, 3, pp. 567-597, (2006); Bondi L., Davidson J., Smith M., Introduction: geography's ""emotional turn, Emotional geographies, pp. 1-18, (2012); Braun B., Towards a new earth and a new humanity: nature, ontology, politics, David harvey: A critical reader, pp. 191-222, (2006); Byg A., Theilade I., Nielsen M.R., Lund J.F., Local ecological knowledge and its relevance for management and research, Development Briefs.

In California, pier fishers are an often overlooked and potentially vulnerable community of practitioners who may include subsistence fishers. Pier fishers' informal, unlicensed status means their rates of catch and consumption of fish are scarcely documented, and scant research probes the demographics, motivations, and practices of the pier fishing community. Using survey data collected at active fishing piers in Santa Barbara County, we examine the perceptions, practices, and characteristics of pier fishers. We present common attributes used to define subsistence fishing in the literature and discuss their application in a “recreational” urban context. Although the specific qualities will vary across contexts, we suggest three suitable and interdependent factors for recognizing urban subsistence fishing: 1) reported consumption frequency, 2) fishers' socioeconomic status, and 3) the social, cultural and psychological “process benefits” identified by fishers. Our findings indicate that pier fishing is a form of subsistence, particularly benefiting low-income, Latino and Asian/Pacific Islander fishers in Santa Barbara County. These results challenge commonly used criteria and assumptions about subsistence practices, and demonstrate the flexibility of fishers to meet multiple individual and collective needs. We propose that marine regulations and policies recognize subsistence fishing as a dimension of coastal resource use in California, and consider its potential contributions to urban food security and community well-being. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","","California; Santa Barbara [California]; United States; Martes; angling; fishing community; food security; pier; regulatory framework; socioeconomic status; subsistence; urban economy; vulnerability","","","","","University of California, Santa Barbara, UCSB","The authors wish to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful and beneficial feedback on this article.

Fine spatial resolution (FRes) commercial satellite image in conjunction with geographic object-based image change analysis (GEOBICA) methods have been used to generate detailed and accurate urban LCLU maps. The integration of a backdating approach improves LCLU change classification results for the first date of a bi-temporal image sequences. Conversely, moderate spatial resolution satellite images such as those from Landsat sensors may not allow for detailed urban land use and land cover mapping. The objective of this study is to test a new bi-temporal change identification approach that integrates image classification of fine spatial resolution satellite imagery at time-2 and moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery (Landsat) at time-1, in a backdating and GEOBICA framework for mapping urban land use change. We compare the results from this approach to those of a GEOBICA approach based on fine spatial resolution imagery in both periods. The overall accuracy of the time-1 Landsat image classification is 0.82 and that of the fine spatial resolution image is 0.87. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the areal change data estimated from the pixel-wise spatial overlay of bi-temporal FRes LCLU maps is 0.80 while that from overlaying a time-2 FRes-generated map to that from a Landsat time-1 image is 0.81. The proposed method can be used in areas that lack FRes data due to limited coverage in the early 2000s. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Backdating; Change detection; Fine spatial resolution; GEOBICA; Land cover; Land use; Landsat; Urban","Change detection; Image analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Land use; Mapping; Remote sensing; Backdating; Change analysis; Change detection; Fine spatial resolution; Geographic object-based image change analyse; Geographic objects; Land cover; LANDSAT; Object based; Objects-based; Spatial resolution; Urban; accuracy assessment; detection method; image analysis; image classification; land cover; land use change; Landsat; map; model; pixel; remote sensing; satellite sensor; spatial resolution; urban area; Landsat","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (G00009708)","This research was supported by the Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science (IDS) program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NASA award number G00009708 .

This study addresses the mismatch between global climate change narratives and local perceptions of environmental change in Moorea, French Polynesia. This study builds on CCV risk perception and adaptation research by analyzing how temporal and historical socio-economic, cultural, political, and ecological contexts shape local perceptions of environmental change among a sample of environmental stakeholders in Moorea. The data were collected prior to the widespread global narrative and social amplification of climate change risk and its particular impact on islands. As such, they offer an important portrait of environmental perceptions in French Polynesia prior to the influence of a circumscribed climate change narrative, which has since come to shape government and NGO responses to environmental change in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories. The data presented in this paper illustrate that perceptions of drivers and effects of environmental change and risk in Moorea are embedded in larger social processes of political economy and ecology, particularly related to contemporary environmental politics, contextualized within the histories of colonialism and tourism-led economic development. Integrating the complexity of local environmental risk perceptions into CCV policy will help to avoid maladaptation, social movements against CCV planning, and may help maximize government and donor investments. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adaptation; Climate change; Moorea; Pacific Islands; Political ecology; Risk perception","Moorea; Society Islands; Windward Islands [Society Islands]; Ecology; Economics; Investments; Risk perception; Adaptation; Environmental perceptions; Environmental politics; Environmental risk perceptions; Environmental stakeholders; Moorea; Pacific islands; Political ecology; adaptive management; climate change; colonization; economic development; environmental change; global change; political economy; risk perception; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; Climate change","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (SBR-9806256, SES-0137458); John D. and Catherine T.

This has sparked scientific debate on how to achieve natural climate solutions. Central to this debate is whether sustainably managing forests and protected areas will deliver global climate mitigation benefits, while ensuring local peoples’ health and well-being. Here, we evaluate the 10-y impact of a human-centered solution to achieve natural climate mitigation through reductions in illegal logging in rural Borneo: an intervention aimed at expanding health care access and use for communities living near a national park, with clinic discounts offsetting costs historically met through illegal logging. Conservation, education, and alternative livelihood programs were also offered. We hypothesized that this would lead to improved health and well-being, while also alleviating illegal logging activity within the protected forest. We estimated that 27.4 km2 of deforestation was averted in the national park over a decade (∼70% reduction in deforestation compared to a synthetic control, permuted P = 0.038). Concurrently, the intervention provided health care access to more than 28,400 unique patients, with clinic usage and patient visitation frequency highest in communities participating in the intervention. Finally, we observed a dose–response in forest change rate to intervention engagement (person-contacts with intervention activities) across communities bordering the park: The greatest logging reductions were adjacent to the most highly engaged villages. Results suggest that this community-derived solution simultaneously improved health care access for local and indigenous communities and sustainably conserved carbon stocks in a protected tropical forest. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Prior to the MPAs enclosing 17% of the islands' lobster fishing grounds, 25 commercial lobster fishermen caught 50% of the regional annual landings from the Channel Islands. To best manage MPAs and affected fisheries we ask a critical question: Where did the fishermen go? Spillover theory emerging from models of MPAs and adjacent fisheries suggests displaced fishermen will concentrate their effort along MPA borders; a phenomenon called ""fishing the line"". These models do not consider habitat-specific fishing effort, habitat heterogeneity, nor fixed-gear fisheries such as lobster where traps are set, soaked for 1 to 3 nights, pulled and re-set. With fixed-gear fishing, space is ""marked"" or occupied, and reduces the possibility of another fisherman to fish that space. Lobster trap fisheries are notoriously territorial as a result. Lobster fisheries therefore stand to experience a skewed impact based on a priori territorial distributions and habitat quality. We use a Geographic Information System (GIS) to map 10 years (5 before reserves and 5 after) of fishery-dependent logbook data assisted with fishery interviews to test if commercial lobster fishermen aggregated fishing effort at MPA borders as an adaptive fishing strategy. We found that fishermen around the Channel Islands MPAs did not concentrate effort at MPA boundaries but instead the proportion of total traps pulled in close proximity (within 1km of reserve borders) to MPAs declined from 10% to 5%. Chi2 analysis found a significant decrease in the proportion of a season's traps pulled in areas near MPA borders (n=157,071; p<.001). T test analysis testing the difference in CPUE between areas far from MPAs and areas adjacent to MPA borders showed a significant reduction in the difference between CPUE following MPA designation (n=50,206; p<.001). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive fishing strategies; Displaced fishing effort; Fishery management; Marine protected areas","","","","","","NSF LTER (for the Santa Barbara Channel) Social Science; UC Marine Council; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1232779)","We thank the regional commercial lobster fishermen and the CA Department of Fish and Game for sharing fishery dependent data.

In particular, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3 aims to, “by 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world”. Addressing this challenge is essential for improving the livelihoods of those most affected by DLDD and for safeguarding against the most extreme effects of climate change. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for improved monitoring of DLDD in the context of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Strategic Objective 2 (SO2) and its expected impacts: food security and adequate access to water for people in affected areas are improved; the livelihoods of people in affected areas are improved and diversified; local people, especially women and youth, are empowered and participate in decision-making processes in combating DLDD; and migration forced by desertification and land degradation is substantially reduced. While it is critical to develop methods and tools for assessing DLDD, work is needed first to provide a conceptual roadmap of the human dimensions of vulnerability in relation to DLDD, especially when attempting to create a globally standardized monitoring approach. © 2023 by the authors.","desertification, land degradation, and drought (DLDD); sustainable development goals; UNCCD Strategic Objectives","conceptual framework; desertification; drought; environmental monitoring; food security; land degradation; livelihood; nature-society relations; strategic approach; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; vulnerability","","","","","Alex Zoleff; Global Environment Facility, GEF","This research was funded by Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Grant.

METHODS Decennial census data of Ghana are used to estimate rates of 5q0 in 2000 and in 2010 and to note changes between 2000 and 2010 for the neighborhoods of Accra. Remote sensing data and methods are then used to derive urban land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC) information for the same neighborhoods and during the same time period. Population and housing demographic characteristics are derived and summarized at the neighborhood level to serve as potential covariates of the measures of urban change. Regression analyses are utilized to evaluate the relationships between child mortality and neighborhood environmental factors. RESULTS Results indicate spatial variability in rates of 5q0 in Accra for the year 2000. Such variations are minimal in 2010 due to the dramatic decline in child mortality between 2000 and 2010. Under-five child mortality was 20% in 2000 and 12% in 2010. Nontraditional toilet types and water supply sources are associated with high rates of 5q0.CONCLUSIONS Less reliance on public and informal toilets as well as improving housing drinking water quality have the potential to reduce under-five child mortality in Ghana. CONTRIBUTION By analyzing an extensive list of exploratory variables derived by combining remote sensing and demographic data, this paper increases our understanding of the factors associated with under-five child mortality. © 2020, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research.","","","","","","","","","Achebe C., Things Fall Apart, (1958);

Direct contact with snail-infested freshwater is the primary route of exposure. Water management infrastructure, including dams and irrigation schemes, expands snail habitat, increasing the risk across the landscape. The Diama Dam, built on the lower basin of the Senegal River to prevent saltwater intrusion and promote year-round agriculture in the drought-prone Sahel, is a paradigmatic case. Since dam completion in 1986, the rural population-whose livelihoods rely mostly on agriculture-has suffered high rates of schistosome infection. The region remains one of the most hyperendemic regions in the world. Because of the convergence between livelihoods and environmental conditions favorable to transmission, schistosomiasis is considered an illustrative case of a disease-driven poverty trap (DDPT). The literature to date on the topic, however, remains largely theoretical. With qualitative data generated from 12 focus groups in four villages, we conducted team-based theme analysis to investigate how perception of schistosomiasis risk and reported preventive behaviors may suggest the presence of a DDPT. Our analysis reveals three key findings: 1) rural villagers understand schistosomiasis risk (i.e., where and when infections occur), 2) accordingly, they adopt some preventive behaviors, but ultimately, 3) exposure persists, because of circumstances characteristic of rural livelihoods. These findings highlight the capacity of local populations to participate actively in schistosomiasis control programs and the limitations of widespread drug treatment campaigns. Interventions that target the environmental reservoir of disease may provide opportunities to reduce exposure while maintaining resource-dependent livelihoods. © 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Agriculture; Animals; Child; Ecosystem; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk; Rivers; Schistosoma; Schistosomiasis; Senegal; Snails; Water; Young Adult; water; adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; behavior; controlled study; environmental exposure; female; geographic distribution; health care policy; health education; health program; high risk behavior; human; infection control; infection risk; male; poverty; risk assessment; rural area; schistosomiasis; Senegal; social determinants of health; water contact behavior; adolescent; agriculture; animal; child; ecosystem; middle aged; parasitology; physiology; risk; river; Schistosoma; schistosomiasis; Senegal; snail; young adult","","water, 7732-18-5; Water, ","","","CNH; Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources; James and Nance Kelso Fellowship; National Science Foundation Coupled Natural-Human Systems program; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1414102); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Fogarty International Center, FIC, (R01TW010286); Fogarty International Center, FIC; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1114050); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Stanford University, SU; Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University; Stanford School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences","Financial support: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Coupled Natural-Human Systems program (grant 1414102), a McGee/Levorsen grant from the School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences, and a summer research grant from the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER) at Stanford University.

Each summer the COEMH hosts a Summer Institute, including workshops featuring new research by doctoral students and early career scholars on this topic. Several presenters also received grants from the Research Program on Migration and Health (PIMSA) at UC Berkeley. Although most of the presenters (and many of the contributors to this special issue) are from the UCs, some are from Mexican universities or US universities located in states along the Mexican border, who collaborate via PIMSA.

However, this growth has also caused inequality of household income in developing regions. Using survey data on rural household livelihoods in Shenmu county, Shaanxi Province, in northwestern China, this paper analyzes the relationship between coal exploitation and income inequality. Four multivariate econometric analyses are developed. We find evidence for the resource curse theory of natural resource exploitation leading to inequality: the Gini coefficient for household revenue is discovered to be markedly related with the location of and participation in coal exploitation. Nevertheless, this correlation is not linear. Rather, household income inequality primitively rises with environmental and resource subsidies. We analyze the impacts of household income inequality and contrast the characteristics of household livelihood and location characteristics in the coal exploitation site of northern Shenmu with those in the whole survey site. Our statistical analysis shows that out-migration, the level of total household income, and convenience of household transportation are the important elements devoting to household income in northern Shenmu, the coal resources endowment region. However, the environmental damage and pollution caused by coal exploitation has substantial negative impacts upon household income, especially for households not participating in coal activities. Overall, we found that coal exploitation did not develop local industries. Adversely, the ecological environment problem and the high subsidy for coal mining caused by the exploitation of coal resources have aggravated the inequality of household income in the sample areas. Additionally, the development of coal resources attracted youth labor from agriculture to the coal industry, which exacerbated the lack of labor force and weakened village agricultural productivity. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","China; Shaanxi; data set; econometrics; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; household survey; income distribution","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42061037)","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 42061037.

Land plays a key role in the global cycles of GHG (i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrogen oxide (N2O)), and land use change (LUC) can lead to the release of such gases into the atmosphere or the removal of them from the atmosphere. One of the most common forms of LUC is agricultural land conversion (ALC) where agricultural lands are converted for other uses. This study aimed to review 51 original papers from 1990 to 2020 that investigate the contribution of ALC to GHG emissions from a spatiotemporal perspective using a meta-analysis method. The results of spatiotemporal effects on GHG emissions showed that the effects were significant. The emissions were affected by different continent regions representing the spatial effects. The most significant spatial effect was relevant to African and Asian countries. In addition, the quadratic relationship between ALC and GHG emissions had the highest significant coefficients, showing an upward concave curve. Therefore, increasing ALC to more than 8 % of available land led to increasing GHG emissions during the economic development process. The implications of the current study are important for policymakers from two perspectives. First, to achieve sustainable economic development, policymaking should prevent the conversion of more than 90 % of agricultural land to other uses based on the turning point of the second model. Second, policies to control global GHG emissions should take into account spatial effects (e.g., continental Africa and Asia), which show the highest contribution to GHG emissions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Greenhouse gases emissions; Land use; Quality evaluation; Spatiotemporal effects","Africa; Asia; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Economics; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Quality control; Agricultural land; CH 4; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Land conversion; Landuse change; Meta-analysis; Quality evaluation; Spatial effect; Spatiotemporal effects; agricultural land; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; land use change; meta-analysis; qualitative analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; Africa; agricultural land; article; Asia; economic development; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas emission; human; land use; meta analysis; sustainable development; Land use","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32071655, 42230708); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (2021VCA0004); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Česká Zemědělská Univerzita v Praze, (2022B0008); Česká Zemědělská Univerzita v Praze","This work was partly supported by the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (project No. 2022B0008 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number: 32071655 ; 42230708 ); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative, PIFI (Grant Number: 2021VCA0004 ).","Alexander P., Rabin S., Anthoni P., Henry R., Pugh T.A.M., Rounsevell M.D.A., Arneth A., Adaptation of global land use and management intensity to changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide, Glob.

But are these benefits offset by increased infectious disease risk? Dam construction on the Senegal River in 1986 was followed by agricultural expansion and increased transmission of human schistosomes. Yet the mechanisms linking these two processes at the individual and household levels remain unclear. We investigated the association between household land use and schistosome infection in children. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional household survey data (n = 655) collected in 16 rural villages in August 2016 across demographic, socio-economic and land use dimensions, which were matched to Schistosoma haematobium (n = 1232) and S. mansoni (n = 1222) infection data collected from school-aged children. Mixed effects regression determined the relationship between irrigated area and schistosome infection presence and intensity. Results: Controlling for socio-economic and demographic risk factors, irrigated area cultivated by a household was associated with an increase in the presence of S. haematobium infection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.03–1.28) but not S. mansoni infection (OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.93–1.11). Associations between infection intensity and irrigated area were positive but imprecise (S. haematobium: rate ratio [RR] = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98–1.13, S. mansoni: RR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.89–1.32). Conclusions: Household engagement in irrigated agriculture increases individual risk of S. haematobium but not S. mansoni infection. Increased contact with irrigated landscapes likely drives exposure, with greater impacts on households relying on agricultural livelihoods.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Exposure; Livelihoods; Planetary health; Schistosomiasis; Senegal; Water contact","Adolescent; Agricultural Irrigation; Animals; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Parasitic Diseases; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Schistosoma; Schistosomiasis; Senegal; Water Microbiology; praziquantel; Article; child; cross-sectional study; environmental health; fecal egg count; feces analysis; female; household; human; infection risk; irrigation (agriculture); land use; landscape; major clinical study; male; parasite transmission; prevalence; questionnaire; Schistosoma haematobium; Schistosoma mansoni; schistosomiasis; school child; socioeconomics; urine sampling; adolescent; animal; microbiology; parasitosis; risk factor; rural population; Schistosoma; schistosomiasis; Senegal","","praziquantel, 55268-74-1","","","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1114050); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; CNH, (1414102); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Science Foundation Coupled Natural Human Systems; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01TW010286); National Institutes of Health, NIH; Freeman Spogli Institute; Stanford University, SU; James and Nance Kelso Fellowship","The authors acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation Coupled Natural Human Systems (CNH) program (Grant 1414102) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1114050).
