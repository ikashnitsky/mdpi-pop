Lovell) decision to adopt community-engaged research was driven by an interest in using research to achieve goals of social justice. While conducting interviews and working with the results of my master’s thesis, I had become acutely aware of how one-directional the relationship between participants and researchers can be in traditional research. The feminist methodologies I had adopted suggested that the interview process should be an empowering experience for the participant as the researcher in valuing and validating the participant’s perspectives. However, like many geographers who have adopted activist and participatory approaches, I found this to be a fairly shallow level of empowerment and commitment to the participant. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Nancy E.

Divided into three sections, Part I reviews how the methods of contemporary human geography reflect the changing intellectual history of human geography and events both within human geography and society in general. In Part II, authors critically appraise key methodological and theoretical challenges and opportunities that are shaping contemporary research in various parts of human geography. Contemporary directions within the discipline are elaborated on by established and emerging researchers who are leading ontological debates and the adoption of innovative methods in geographic research. In Part III, authors explore cross-cutting methodological challenges and prompt questions about the values and goals underpinning geographical research work, such as: Who are we engaging in our research? Who is our research ‘for'? What are our relationships with communities? Contributors emphasize examples from their research and the research of others to reflect the fluid, emotional and pragmatic realities of research. This handbook captures key methodological developments and disciplinary influences emerging from the various sub-disciplines of human geography. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Sarah A.

The incorporation of meaningful activity or occupation in supporting those transitioning from homelessness to being housed has been promoted by researchers; however, there is little evidence to support the promotion of initiatives encouraging its use in support models. Purpose. This manuscript aims to advocate for further research into the role of occupation in supporting persons transitioning from homelessness to permanent housing. Key Issues. The transition from homelessness to becoming housed can be facilitated through use of occupation as a way of promoting the security of meaningful roles and a ""housed identity"" among persons experiencing homelessness. Implications. By promoting an emphasis on occupation, persons experiencing homelessness may undergo a positive change in identity. This change may improve housing tenure and the likelihood of a more permanent transition away from homelessness. More research is required to identify the relationship between occupation and the transition from homelessness. © CAOT 2014.","Homeless persons; Housing; Human activities; Occupational therapy; Social welfare","Homeless Persons; Housing; Humans; Occupational Therapy; Vocational Guidance; homelessness; housing; human; occupational therapy; vocational guidance","","","","","","","Improving the Health of Canadians: Mental Health and Homelessness, (2007); Cauce A., Paradise M., Ginzler J., Embry L., Morgan C., Lohr Y., Theofelis J., The characteristics and mental health of homeless adolescents: Age and gender differences, Journal of Emotional & Behavioral Disorders, 8, pp. 230-239, (2000); Cauce A.M., Whitbeck L.B., Johnson K.D., Hoyt D.R., Mental disorder and comorbidity among runaway and homeless adolescents, Journal of Adolescent Health, 35, pp. 132-140, (2004); Chapleau A., Voices from the street: How structural and individual factors influence homelessness, Occupational Therapy in Mental Health, 26, pp. 387-400, (2010); Cornejo C., Intersubjectivity as co-phenomenology: From the holism of meaning to being in the world with others, Integrative Psychological and Behavioural Science, 42, pp. 171-178, (2008); Corvinelli A., Boredom in recovery for adult substance users with HIV/AIDS attending an urban day treatment program, Occupational Therapy in Mental Health, 28, pp. 201-319, (2012); Coumans M., Spreen M., Drug use and the role of homelessness in the process of marginalization, Substance Use and Misuse, 38, 3-6, pp. 311-338, (2003); Czikszentmihalyi M., Beyond Boredom and Anxiety: Experiencing Flow in Work and Play, (2000); Dejong I., Housing First, (2012); Eakman A., Eklund M., The relative impact of personality traits, meaningful occupation and occupational value on meaning in life and life satisfaction, Journal of Occupational Science, 19, pp. 165-177, (2012); Echenberg H., Jensen H., Defining and Enumerating Homelessness in Canada, (2008); Eklund M., Occupational Therapy in Mental Health: A Vision for Participation, pp. 649-658, (2011); Fischer B., Rudzinski K., Ivsins A., Gallupe O., Patra J., Krajden M., Social, health and drug use characteristics of primary crack users in three mid-size communities in British Columbia, Canada, Drugs: Education, Prevention, and Policy, 17, pp. 333-353, (2010); Fleetwood M., Housing services in the US: Looking back, looking forward: An open letter to policy makers, advocates, and providers, Open Health Services and Policy Journal, 3, pp. 27-29, (2010); Gaetz S., The struggle to end homelessness in Canada: How we created the crisis, and how we can end it [Editorial], Open Health Services and Policy Journal, 3, pp. 21-26, (2010); Gaetz S., Making Research Matter: Creating Impact for Housing and Homelessness Research, (2012); Gaetz S., The Real Cost of Homelessness: Can We Save Money by Doing the Right Thing?, (2012); Gaetz S., Donaldson J., Richter T., Gulliver T., The State of Homelessness in Canada, 2013, (2013); Gillis L., Dickerson G., Hanson J., Recovery and homeless services: New directions for the field, Open Health Services and Policy Journal, 3, pp. 71-79, (2010); Glisson G., Thyer B., Fischer R., Serving the homeless: Evaluating the effectiveness of homeless shelter services, Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare, 28, 4, pp. 89-97, (2001); Goldberg B., Brintnell E.S., Goldberg J., The relationship between engagement in meaningful activities and quality of life in persons disabled by mental illness, Occupational Therapy in Mental Health, 19, 2, pp. 17-44, (2002); Goodman L.A., Saxe L., Harvey M., Homelessness as psychological trauma: Broadening perspectives, American Psychologist, 46, pp. 1219-1225, (1991); Harmer B., Orrell M., What is meaningful activity for people with dementia living in care homes?

This study evaluated the relationship between colonoscopy availability and the length of the CRC diagnostic interval. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of CRC patients diagnosed in Ontario, Canada, in 2008–2012. We used administrative health data to characterise colonoscopist density, private colonoscopy clinic access, distance to the closest colonoscopist and the diagnostic interval, defined as the time from patients’ first cancer-related healthcare encounter to their cancer diagnosis date. We used multivariable quantile regression to evaluate the association between colonoscopy availability and the diagnostic interval, modelling the median and 90th percentile. Results: The median diagnostic interval was 84 days (90th percentile 323 days). The diagnostic interval was longer in patients residing in areas with lower colonoscopists density or private clinic access (adjusted median difference = 9 and 19 days, respectively), with evidence of effect modification by symptom status. Increased distance to a colonoscopist was associated with a longer diagnostic interval in asymptomatic patients, but a shorter diagnostic interval in symptomatic patients (adjusted median difference = 29 and −25 days, respectively). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that reduced colonoscopy resource availability is associated with longer diagnostic intervals for CRC patients. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","administrative data; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; diagnostic interval; health services accessibility","Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delayed Diagnosis; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Health Resources; Health Services Accessibility; Health Workforce; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Physicians; Private Facilities; Time Factors; Travel; Young Adult; adenocarcinoma; adult; aged; building; colonoscopy; colorectal tumor; cross-sectional study; delayed diagnosis; early cancer diagnosis; female; health care delivery; health care planning; human; male; middle aged; Ontario; physician; time factor; travel; very elderly; young adult","","","","","Canadian Institute for Health Information; Cancer Care Ontario, CCO; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, ICES; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR; Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, MOHLTC","Funding text 1:  This study demonstrated that reduced colonoscopy resource availability is associated with longer diagnostic intervals for CRC patients.

Drawing on 27 semi-structured interviews with former partners in care in Southwestern and Northern Ontario, Canada, we examine experiences of providing and accessing care over the course of the condition and across various settings. Our findings illustrate the challenges associated with navigating the system of care, finding people who understand dementia in the surrounding community, negotiating hours of home support, facing resistance to respite from the person with dementia, and feeling pressured into long-term care. We argue that partners' time, bodies and choices are spatially constrained within rural and small-town settings and the current systems of home, community and long-term care. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Canada; care; dementia; qualitative; rural; settings; transitions","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; mental health; qualitative analysis; rural area","","","","","","","Adelman R.D., Tmanova L.L., Delgado D., Dion S., Lachs M.S., Caregiver burden: A clinical review, JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, 311, 10, pp. 1052-1060, (2014); Andrews G., Evans J., Wiles J.L., Re-spacing and re-placing gerontology: Relationality and affect, Ageing & Society, 33, 8, pp. 1339-1373, (2013); Andrews G.J., Grenier J.M., Ageing movement as space-time: Introducing nonrepresentational theory to the geography of ageing, Progress in Geography, 34, 122, pp. 1512-1534, (2015); Atkinson S., Lawson V., Wiles J., Care of the body: Spaces of practice, Social & Cultural Geography, 12, 6, pp. 563-572, (2011); Baxter J., Case studies in qualitative research, Qualitative Research Methods in Human Geography.

However, there is limited knowledge or research on the effect of place, chronic health conditions, and socioeconomic status on the risk of overnight hospital admission or the frequency of hospitalisation among older adults in Ghana. Using the WHO SAGE (Wave 1) data, we examine the influence of place of residence, chronic health conditions, and socioeconomic status on overnight hospital admission, as well as, frequency of hospital admission among older adults in Ghana. Multivariate logistic regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were used to study the influence of place, health conditions, and socioeconomic status on overnight hospital admission. The findings show that older adults with functional limitations and chronical health conditions were more likely to have experienced an overnight hospital admission. The expected number of overnight hospital admission was greater among chronically ill older adults than their healthy counterparts. However, the findings show that socioeconomically vulnerable older adults were less likely to have overnight hospital admission and they had lower admission rates. The presence of chronic health conditions is associated with overnight hospital admission, while poor socioeconomic status may imply underutilization or limited access to healthcare for the socioeconomically vulnerable. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Chronic health;

Drawing on a mobilities perspective, changes in everyday life are represented by spatial mobilities and the impacts of social mobilities on them are assessed at a household level. Employing rural survey data for 2007 and 2017 conducted in Jianghan Plain, China, results reveal that everyday life in central rural China has undergone an uneven development and is significantly impacted by social mobilities. As one of the main agricultural production regions in China, the livelihood strategies in the study area have been shifting from full-time farming to part-time farming and non-farm. The effects of the process of social mobilities on working, consuming and leisure mobilities are also unevenly distributed. Our findings suggest that the perspective of everyday life deserves further investigation for its important role in exploring the human–land relationship in a rural context. And the mobilities paradigm can provide an alternative insight into rural restructuring and its social effects. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Everyday life; Jianghan Plain; mobilities; rural restructuring; rural transformation","China; Hubei; Jianghan Plain; agricultural production; mobility; rural area; rural development; social behavior","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41671179, 42071170); China Scholarship Council, CSC","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance from China Scholarship Council. ; Funding text 2: The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41671179, No. 42071170).

IPV leads to negative health outcomes among women, including vulnerability to HIV infection, depression and suicide. Lower socioeconomic status among women has been identified as a major risk factor for exposure to IPV. Evidence from existing studies shows that higher education level among women serves as a protective measure against IPV. However, knowledge about spatial variations in IPV and higher education among women is limited. Using estimates from the 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey data, we employed geographically weighted regression analysis to examine the spatial variability of the relationship between women's post-secondary education and IPV. The results of our OLS and GWR models show that women's post-secondary education significantly reduce their exposure to IPV. Mapping the GWR coefficient estimates of women's post-secondary education shows that the protective effect of women's post-secondary education is high in the eastern and central parts of Uganda. The findings suggest geographical variations in the relationship between women's post-secondary education and IPV. It also offers insight on areas for possible interventions measures to reduce IPV rates among women and increase women's access to post-secondary education. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Geographically weighted regression; Intimate partner violence; Post-secondary education; Uganda; Women","Uganda; geographical variation; health impact; higher education; regression analysis; risk factor; socioeconomic status; spatial variation; violence; womens status","","","","","Canada Research Chairs","We are grateful for helpful comments from the editors and anonymous reviewers.

We considered environmental and nutritional factors relating to longevity in Chinese cities. We found higher 85+/65+ distribution ratios, indicating enhanced longevity, in the coastal and southern regions of China. These areas also featured higher humidity, low standard deviation of monthly temperature, higher levels of selenium (Se) distribution in soil, and greater sea fish consumption. Moderate climate is more conducive to longevity, however, there is no significant difference in longevity between different sub-climatic types within moderate climate; the relation between humidity and longevity is not always positive, the relation between altitude and longevity is not always negative. Nutritional factors like Se and omega-3 fatty acids contained in sea fish were crucial to longevity. In contrast, the consumption of meat and freshwater fish were less related to longevity. Taken together, humidity, altitude, and per capita sea fish consumption, when evaluated via geographically weighted regression, explained 66% and 68% of longevity among Chinese individuals in 2000 and 2010, respectively. Other factors require further discussion. © 2017 by the authors.

The off-reserve Indigenous population represents the fastest growing segment of the Indigenous population, with over 50% living in urban settings. Despite the size of the off-reserve population, research on the health of Indigenous peoples tends to remain focused on reserve-based populations. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of health and social determinants of health among off-reserve Indigenous peoples in Canada. Using data from the 1991 and 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Surveys this paper examines changes in health status and the social determinants of health over a 20-year time span. Results show a decline in health care use and self-reported health status in the period between 1991 and 2012. The results may be related to urbanization, aging, and increased prevalence of some chronic conditions. The findings may also be tied to barriers to achieving adequate off-reserve health care—jurisdictional disputes, disjointed program coverage, systemic racism, and a lack of equity-oriented health services. There remains a pressing need for Indigenous and non-Indigenous governments, researchers, and policymakers to build new relationships that bridge these gaps in health and access to timely care. © 2020 Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association canadienne des géographes","Aboriginal Peoples Survey; Indigenous health; social determinants of health; urban health","Canada; health care; health status; indigenous population; public access; public health; trend analysis","","","","","","","Adelson N., The embodiment of inequity: Health disparities in Aboriginal Canada, Canadian Journal of Public Health, 96, 2, pp. S45-S61, (2005); Allan B., Smylie J., First Peoples, second class treatment: The role of racism in the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples in Canada, (2015); Auger M., Howell T., Gomes T., Moving toward holistic wellness, empowerment and self-determination for Indigenous Peoples in Canada: Can traditional Indigenous health care practices increase ownership over health and health care decisions?, Canadian Journal of Public Health, 107, 4-5, pp. e393-e398, (2016); Browne A.J., McDonald H., Elliott D., Urban First Nation health research discussion paper, (2009); Browne A.J., Varcoe C., Lavoie J., Smye V., Wong S.T., Krause M., Tu D., Godwin O., Khan K., Fridkin A., Enhancing health care equity with Indigenous populations: Evidence-based strategies from an ethnographic study, BMC Health Services Research, 16, 1, pp. 1-17, (2016); Budinski R., Langlet E., Aboriginal Peoples Survey 2012: User's guide to the public use microdata file (PUMF), (2015); Chiripanhura B., Median and mean income analyses: Their implications for material living standards and national well-being, Economic and Labour Market Review, 5, 2, pp. 45-63, (2011); Cloutier E., Langlet E., Aboriginal Peoples Survey, 2012: Concepts and methods guide, (2014); Costa R.G.B., The 1991 post-censal Aboriginal Peoples Survey: An overview of the development of the survey, its content and planned outputs, (1992); DeVerteuil G., Conceptualizing violence for health and medical geography, Social Science & Medicine, 133, pp. 216-222, (2015); DeVerteuil G., Wilson K., Reconciling Indigenous need with the urban welfare state?

There is an urgent need to understand the spatial patterns and factors that influence older adults to migrate, especially the role of environmental health. However, this issue has been under-studied. This study focused on intra-provincial and inter-provincial older adult migrants as research subjects, estimated their spatial concentration index based on the iterative proportional fitting approach, and explored the factors influencing their migration using the GeoDetector Model. The results showed the following: (1) In 2015, more than 76% of inter-provincial older adult migrants were distributed in Eastern China, and most intra-provincial older adult migrants were scattered in sub-provincial cities. (2) Compared to factors relating to economy and amenities, environmental health by itself played a relatively weak role in the migration of older adults, but the interaction among environmental health, economy, and amenities was a key driving force of older adult migration. (3) There were significant differences in the dominant environmental health factors between inter-provincial migration and intra-provincial migration, which were temperature and altitude, respectively. Our findings can help policymakers focus on the composition of older adult migrants based on urban environmental health characteristics and rationally optimize older adult care facilities to promote supply-demand matching.

Universal coverage and access to health care in the country are narrowly limited to hospital-based and physician-based services—“medically necessary services.” In view of the variations in public support programs for dental care, our study examines differences in the use of dental care services among different socio-economic groups in Alberta, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The study used 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey data. Our analyses find that in all the three provinces persons of lower socio-economic status have lower utilization of dental care. However, the study further reveals that the gaps between age and household income groups was wider in Newfoundland and Labrador compared to the other provinces. These findings suggest that public support for dental care reduces socio-economic disparities in the use of dental services. © 2018 Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association canadienne des géographes","Alberta; CCHS; dental care; Manitoba; Newfoundland and Labrador","Alberta; Canada; Manitoba; Newfoundland and Labrador; comparative study; dental health; health services; health survey; public health; socioeconomic conditions","","","","","Canada Research Chairs","We are grateful for helpful comments from the anonymous referees.

Understanding the role of system-level resources in colonoscopy utilisation may point to a potential intervention target to improve colonoscopy use. This study characterises colonoscopy resource availability in Ontario, Canada and evaluates its relationship with colonoscopy utilisation. Design We conducted a population-based study using administrative health data to describe regional variation in colonoscopy availability for Ontario residents (age 18-99) in 2013. We identified 43 colonoscopy networks in the province in which we described variations across three colonoscopy availability measures: colonoscopist density, private clinic access and distance to colonoscopy. We evaluated associations between colonoscopy resource availability and colonoscopy utilisation rates using Pearson correlation and log binomial regression, adjusting for age and sex. Results There were 9.4 full-time equivalent colonoscopists per 100 000 Ontario residents (range across 43 networks 0.0 to 21.8); 29.5% of colonoscopies performed in the province were done in private clinics (range 1.2%-55.9%). The median distance to colonoscopy was 3.7 km, with 5.9% travelling at least 50 km. Lower colonoscopist density was correlated with lower colonoscopy utilisation rates (r=0.53, p<0.001). Colonoscopy utilisation rates were 4% lower in individuals travelling 50 to <200 km and 11% lower in individuals travelling ≥200 km to colonoscopy, compared to <10 km. There was no association between private clinic access and colonoscopy utilisation. Conclusion The substantial variations in colonoscopy resource availability and the relationship demonstrated between colonoscopy resource availability and use provides impetus for health service planners and decision-makers to address these potential inequalities in access in order to support the use of this medically necessary procedure.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Employing data produced from a household survey, we developed a composite index for accessibility of rural life space incorporating spatial and temporal attributes of a household’s daily activities and then explored the mediation effect of rural livelihood capital and transitions on accessibility. Results revealed a pattern of diversification in terms of life space accessibility undertaken for daily activities across households. Both livelihood capital and transitions had significant mediation effects on the relationship between socio-economic characteristics of rural households and accessibility of rural life space. The effects of livelihood capital on livelihood transitions also influenced the path on rural households’ accessibility of rural life space. One of the implications of this article is to link rural transformation to the context of urbanization and rural access issues from a perspective of daily activity, and then to figure out the best method for rural development policy and service planning. © 2021 by the authors.

We conducted a case study of Wangqing County, a frontier minority area in Northeast China to examine spatial patterns and income differentials among poor rural households in this area. We quantified existing associations between household-level and environmental-level characteristics and income by applying hierarchical linear models. We subsequently applied Geographically Weighted Regression to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of the environmental-level variables and develop an understanding of the interaction mechanism of influencing factors. The results revealed that the distribution of villages, where income levels were similar, showed significant spatial agglomeration characteristics. Our findings also provide empirical evidence that household- A nd village-level characteristics together determine the income of poor households, but that household-level characteristics determine destitution to a greater extent than environmental characteristics. More specifically, the sex, health condition, and labor capacity of the household head, household size, the dependency ratio, social welfare, and off-farm work are significantly associated with household income. At the environmental level, arable land, the distance to the county center, and the average altitude had spatially heterogeneous impacts that varied in direction and intensity. This systematic study provides a more comprehensive and integrated understanding of the factors influencing the income of poor households in a frontier minority area in Northeast China.  © 2021 Binyan Wang et al.","","Sustainable development;

The book focuses on the philosophical commitments that shape their conceptualisations and practices of research. It explains the ethical shifts that have been made in human geography research. The book argues that, in many ways, there was a time and place for damage-centered research. It explores the consideration of decision making in research as a political act that serves to reinforce or resist existing power structures emerges as a predominant theme. The book provides postgraduate students and more senior academics alike with reference points for summative methods discussions within some of the core sub-disciplinary areas. It emphasises examples from their research and the research of others to reflect the fluid, emotional, and pragmatic realities of research. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Sarah A.

However, no study has examined the association between caregiver burden and HRQoL among informal caregivers of older adults in Ghana to date. Understanding this association may well help to inform health and social policy measures to improve HRQoL among informal caregivers of older adults in Ghana. Situated within a conceptual model of HRQoL, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between caregiver burden and HRQoL among informal caregivers of older adults in Ghana. Methods: We obtained cross-sectional data from informal caregiving, health, and healthcare (N = 1853) survey conducted between July and September 2022 among caregivers (≥ 18 years) of older adults (≥ 50 years) in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The World Health Organization Impact of Caregiving Scale was used to measure caregiver burden. An 8-item short form Health Survey scale developed by the RAND Corporation and the Medical Outcomes Study was used to measure HRQoL. Generalized Linear Models were employed to estimate the association between caregiver burden and HRQoL. Beta values and standard errors were reported with a significance level of 0.05 or less. Results: The mean age of the informal caregivers was 39.15 years and that of the care recipients was 75.08 years. In our final model, the results showed that caregiver burden was negatively associated with HRQoL (β = −.286, SE =.0123, p value = 0.001). In line with the conceptual model of HRQoL, we also found that socio-economic, cultural, demographic and healthcare factors were significantly associated with HRQoL. For instance, participants with no formal education (β = −1.204, SE=.4085, p value = 0.01), those with primary level of education (β = −2.390, SE=.5099, p value = 0.001) or junior high school education (β = −1.113, SE=.3903, p value= 0.01) had a significantly decreased HRQoL compared to those with tertiary level of education. Participants who were between the ages of 18–24 (β = 2.960, SE=.6306, p value=0.001), 25–34 (β = 1.728, SE=.5794, p value = 0.01) or 35–44 (β = 1.604, SE=.5764, p value= 0.01) years significantly had increased HRQoL compared to those who were 65 years or above. Also, participants who did not utilize healthcare services in the past year before the survey significantly had increased HRQoL compared to those who utilized healthcare services five or more times in the past year (β = 4.786, SE=. 4610, p value= 0.001). Conclusion: Consistent with our hypothesis, this study reported a significant negative association between caregiver burden and HRQoL. Our findings partially support the conceptual model of HRQoL used in this study. We recommend that health and social policy measures to improve HRQoL among informal caregivers of older adults should consider caregiver burden as well as other significant socio-economic, cultural, demographic, and healthcare factors. © The Author(s) 2024.","Caregiver burden; Ghana; Health-related quality of life; Informal caregivers; Older adults","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Caregiver Burden; Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ghana; Humans; Quality of Life; Young Adult; adult; aged; article; caregiver; caregiver burden; conceptual model; cross-sectional study; developing country; female; Ghana; human; informal care; informal caregiver; major clinical study; male; middle school; quality of life; Short Form 8; adolescent; caregiver; caregiver burden; Ghana; young adult","","","","","","","Population Facts; The Elderly in Ghana, (2013); Agyemang-Duah W., Asante D., Oduro Appiah J., Morgan K.A., Mensah I.V., Peprah P., Mensah A.A., System, institutional, and client-level factors associated with formal healthcare utilisation among older adults with low income under a social protection scheme in Ghana, Arch Public Health, 81, 68, pp. 1-11, (2023); Audain K., Carr M., Dikmen D., Zotor F., Ellahi B., Exploring the health status of older persons in Sub-Saharan Africa, Proc Nutr Soc, 76, 4, pp. 574-579, (2017); Gyasi R.M., Phillips D.R., Aging and the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-and middle-income countries: a call for holistic action, Gerontologist, 60, 5, pp. 806-811, (2020); Ayernor P.K., Diseases of ageing in Ghana, Ghana Med J, 46, 2, pp. 18-22, (2012); Agyemang-Duah W., Peprah C., Arthur-Holmes F., Prevalence and patterns of health care use among poor older people under the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty program in the Atwima Nwabiagya District of Ghana, Gerontol Geriatr Med, 5, pp. 1-13, (2019); Minicuci N., Biritwum R.B., Mensah G., Yawson A.E., Naidoo N., Chatterji S., Kowal P., Sociodemographic and socioeconomic patterns of chronic non-communicable disease among the older adult population in Ghana, Glob Health Action, 7, 1, (2014); Awoke M.A., Negin J., Moller J., Farell P., Yawson A.E., Biritwum R.B., Kowal P., Predictors of public and private healthcare utilization and associated health system responsiveness among older adults in Ghana, Glob Health Action, 10, 1, pp. 1-11, (2017); Banerjee C., Multi-morbidity-older adults need health care that can count past one, Lancet, 385, 9968, pp. 587-589, (2015); Adatara P., Amooba P.A., A qualitative exploration of barriers to the utilisation of outpatient healthcare services among older persons in the Ho Municipality of Volta Region of Ghana, Int J Afr Nurs Sci, 15, pp. 1-8, (2021); Agyemang-Duah W., Peprah C., Peprah P., Barriers to formal healthcare utilisation among poor older people under the livelihood empowerment against poverty programme in the Atwima Nwabiagya District of Ghana, BMC Public Health, 19, 1, pp. 1-12, (2019); Integrated care for older people (ICOPE).

However, there is no study to understand their physical and mental health status. We hypothesized that most of these immigrant workers have elevated physical and mental health problems because of lowered self-esteem, job dissatisfaction, and work-related stress. A survey questionnaire containing 49 questions was designed to collect quantitative data (n = 146) from skilled immigrants working as taxi drivers, convenience store workers, and gas station workers in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Analysis of the data involved the use of descriptive as well as inferential statistics to understand the predictors of self-reported health status. Skilled immigrants who are working in an occupation that underutilizes their knowledge, skills, and experience are found to have elevated levels of work-related stress, poor quality of life, and deteriorated physical and mental health. Ethnic origin of the participant, level of education, years spent on current occupation, degree of job satisfaction, level of work-related stress, Body Mass Index (BMI), and chronic health conditions are good predictors of self-reported health of skilled immigrants working in these occupations. © 2015 Canadian Association of Geographers.","Canada; health; immigrants; occupation; stress","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Ottawa; health status; immigrant; mental health; migrant worker; occupation; questionnaire survey; skilled labor","","","","","","","Aldwin M.C., Yancura L.A., Effects of stress on health and aging: Two paradoxes, California Agriculture, 64, 4, pp. 183-188, (2010); Wilson K., Education?

While challenges to the doctor-patient relationship are a global concern, complex social contexts which introduce familial collectivism and totalitarian bureaucracy to maintain a doctor's authority have complicated doctor-patient relationships in China. This study delineates a multi-dimensional therapeutic landscape of hospitals in China, focusing on the doctor-patient relationship performances used to improve patients' healing experiences. Based on fieldwork in two primary hospitals in Eastern China, we find that primary hospitals in China are not only professional spaces, but hybrids of professional and non-professional spaces. In these spaces, both professional and other discourses in various forms of social-environmental engagement affect therapeutic experiences. Varying time and space in hospitals allow doctors to construct multi-dimensional therapeutic landscapes vis-a-vis patients to secure patients' compliance with their recommendations, and thus improve health outcomes. We argue that these dimensions may also cause negative therapeutic experience such as unnecessary health care. This study contributes to the literature on therapeutic landscapes of health care by providing a critical view on the construction of multi-dimensional therapeutic hospital landscapes. Furthermore, it links the critical health geographies literature with China's broader social context to explicate the cultural and social transformation of health care spaces in contemporary China. Findings from this study inform both theoretical and empirical debates regarding therapeutic landscapes of health care by embedding the professional spaces of health care into broader geographical discourses. This calls for health professionals to reflect on ethical concerns in multi-dimensional health care landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Doctor-patient relationship; Hospital; Multi-dimensionality; Temporality; Therapeutic landscapes","China; Friends; Hospitals; Humans; Physician-Patient Relations; Physicians; China; disease treatment; health care; health geography; health services; health worker; hospital sector; adult; article; China; embedding; field work; friend; human; medical geography; social environment; theoretical study; China; doctor patient relationship; friend; hospital; physician","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41901185); Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (GXWD20201230155427003-20200821180448001)","The author would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

In this article, we take up recent arguments on the potential of indoor spaces to illuminate processes shaping health, together with social theories of gender, to conceptualize the place of the gym as a window into understanding and intervening in wider gender disparities in physical activity. Using a triangulated strategy of qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews, drawing, and journaling with men and women in a mid-sized Canadian city, we examine how gender influences exercise practices and mobilities in gym environments. Results of our thematic analysis reveal three socio-spatial processes implicated in the gendering of physical activity: 1) embodying gender ideals, 2) policing gender performance, and 3) spatializing gender relations. A fourth theme illustrates the situated agency some individuals enact to disrupt gendered divisions. Although women were unduly disadvantaged, both women and men experienced significant limitations on their gym participation due to the presiding gendered social context of the gym. Gender-transformative interventions that go beyond engaging women to comprehensively contend with the place-based gender relations that sustain gender hegemony are needed. While gyms are potentially sites for health promotion, they are also places where gendered inequities in health opportunities emerge. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gender; Gyms; Health inequities; Physical activity; Place","Adult; Canada; Exercise; Female; Fitness Centers; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Sex Factors; Canada; gender disparity; gender relations; health care; mobility; physical activity; social theory; urban area; adult; drawing; exercise; female; gender; health promotion; human; human experiment; male; physical activity; qualitative analysis; semi structured interview; social environment; thematic analysis; Canada; exercise; health center; health disparity; middle aged; qualitative research; sex factor","","","","","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR; Queen's University","SEC's doctoral research was supported by a Frederick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship (# 134844 ) from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , an Ontario Graduate Scholarship , and Graduate Awards from Queen's University .

We propose a conceptual framework through which urban open spaces are transformed into “therapeutic public spaces”. Following eight months of fieldwork in public parks in two Chinese cities, we found that the assemblage of physical and social elements, as well as elderly people’s performances, facilitated a collective identity among elderly people, a new norm of pursuing health, and a reciprocal relationship between disparate participants. This, in turn, delivers the health sense to various participants in urban open spaces. This study contributes to a relational conceptualization of therapeutic landscapes and public spaces by blueprinting a therapeutic public space that is constructed through the collaboration of various social groups. This study also contributes to a greater understanding of elderly people’s role in the conceptualization of “age-friendly” and “healthy” cities. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aging; China; healthy cities; leisure activities; Public spaces; therapeutic landscapes","China; aging population; elderly population; open space; public space; recreational activity; urban geography","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41901185); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (GXWD20201230155427003-20200821180448001)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901185]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission [GXWD20201230155427003-20200821180448001].","Amin A., Thrift N., Cities: Reimaging the urban, (2002); Andrews G.J., Co-creating health’s lively, moving frontiers: Brief observations on the facets and possibilities of non-representational theory, Health & Place, 30, pp. 165-170, (2014); Andrews G.J., Health geographies II: The posthuman turn, Progress in Human Geography, 43(6), (2018); Andrews G.J., Evans J., Wiles J.L., Re-spacing and re-placing gerontology: Relationality and affect, Ageing and Society, 33, 8, pp. 1339-1373, (2013); Bell S.L., Foley R., Houghton F., Maddrell A., Williams A.M., From therapeutic landscapes to healthy spaces, places and practices: A scoping review, Social Science & Medicine, 196, pp. 123-130, (2018); Brajer V., Mead R.W., Valuing air pollution mortality in China’s cities, Urban Studies, 41, 8, pp. 1567-1585, (2004); Bray D., Social space and governance in urban China: The Danwei system from origins to reform, (2005); Carpiano R.M., Come take a walk with me: The “Go-Along” interview as a novel method for studying the implications of place for health and well-being, Health & Place, 15, 1, pp. 263-272, (2009); Cattell V., Dines N., Gesler W., Curtis S., Mingling, observing, and lingering: Everyday public spaces and their implications for well-being and social relations, Health & Place, 14, 3, pp. 544-561, (2008); Chen J., Chen N., Everyday knowledge on the move: Dynamic process and micro politics of the transfer of Guangchang wu, Mobilities, 13, 6, pp. 921-936, (2018); Chen N.N., Breathing spaces: Qigong, psychiatry, and healing in China, (2003); Cheng Y., Rosenberg M.W., Wang W., Yang L., Li H., Aging, health and place in residential care facilities in Beijing, China, Social Science & Medicine, 72, 3, pp. 365-372, (2011); Conradson D., Landscape, care and the relational self: Therapeutic encounters in rural England, Health & Place, 11, 4, pp. 337-348, (2005); Corburn J., Toward the healthy city: People, places, and the politics of urban planning, (2009); Dirksmeier P., Helbrecht I., Intercultural interaction and “situational places”: A perspective for urban cultural geography within and beyond the performative turn, Social Geography, 5, 1, pp. 39-48, (2010); Duff C., Exploring the role of ‘enabling places’ in promoting recovery from mental illness: A qualitative test of a relational model, Health & Place, 18, 6, pp. 1388-1395, (2012); Farquhar J., Zhang Q., Ten thousand things: Nurturing life in contemporary Beijing, (2012); Finlay J., Franke T., McKay H., Sims-Gould J., Therapeutic landscapes and wellbeing in later life: Impacts of blue and green spaces for older adults, Health & Place, 34, pp. 97-106, (2015); Flock R., Breitung W., Migrant street vendors in urban China and the social production of public space, Population, Space and Place, 22, 2, pp. 158-169, (2016); Foley R., Performing health in place: The holy well as a therapeutic assemblage, Health & Place, 17, 2, pp. 470-479, (2011); Foley R., Kistemann T., Blue space geographies: Enabling health in place, Health & Place, 35, pp. 157-165, (2015); Franck K.A., Stevens Q., Loose space: Possibility and diversity in urban life, (2006); Gaubatz P., New public space in urban China.

While its health care system is an important part of Canadian identity, recent immigrants living in some provinces and territories are not covered by the publicly funded healthcare system until they have met a minimum residency requirement. This article seeks to understand the multiple manifestations of financial and emotional precarity that recent immigrants face as they navigate a lack of access to health care during their first three months of arrival in Ontario. This paper draws on qualitative semi-structured interview data from 46 recent immigrants who came from 12 different countries and had been living in Ontario, Canada. We found that the wait period to obtain health care often added to the prohibitive costs associated with immigration and settlement. During the wait period, recent immigrants faced financial burdens and their inability to access publicly funded hospitals and medical services when needed which resulted in feelings of vulnerability, anxiety, and emotional hardship. Given the financial and emotional precarities faced by recent immigrants during the wait period, we argue that the Canadian ‘universal’ healthcare system excludes and creates barriers to timely and equitable access to healthcare services for recent immigrants. We recommend to permanently eliminate the wait period policy to ensure the health and wellbeing of recent immigrants. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Access to healthcare; Precarity; Qualitative method; Recent immigrants; Wait-period","Canada; Emigrants and Immigrants; Emigration and Immigration; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Negotiating; Ontario; anxiety; article; Canada; health care access; health care system; health service; human; immigrant; immigration; negotiation; Ontario; perception; qualitative analysis; semi structured interview; vulnerability; wellbeing; Canada; migrant; migration; Ontario","","","","","Newcomer Centre of Peel; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek, TNO","The authors would like to thank all the participants who took part in this study, and the Newcomer Centre of Peel and TNO - The Neighbourhood Organization for assistance with the research.

The gender gap in physical activity is well-documented, with women around the world less likely than men to meet the minimum physical activity recommendations for health. Fitness gyms are popular venues for physical activity, but they are not necessarily inclusive places. Through a reflexive thematic analysis of interview and journaling data with 52 Canadian women and men gym users, we identify five visceral domains through which the gym enacts gender boundaries: the imaginary, bodily haptics, the soundscape, visual fields, and material “stuff“. Each of these revealed a series of gendered dichotomies that, taken together, contribute to an overarching gender binary of unbounded masculinity and bounded femininity. We argue that these “visceralities“ matter because the gym as an institution comes to codify gender differences in ways that perpetuate possibilities for practising physical activity as bifurcated ways of doing gender. One of our key findings is how women’s participation in the gym was underwritten by material expense and bodily preparatory practices that extend far beyond the gym into the geographies of their daily lives. Physical activity interventions that do not account for the multisensorial features of place may miss opportunities to reduce gendered inequities. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Gender; gyms; health; performativity; visceral geography","","","","","","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, IRSC","Coen’s doctoral research was supported by Frederick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship Doctoral Awards [#134844] from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).

This research aims to understand the intergenerational differences of social support for the elderly in the socio-cultural context of Beijing. Methods and Results: To answer this research question, we collected 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews from elders aged 60 and over in three communities in Beijing. The constant comparative method was used for analysis. The results show that the young-old (people aged 60 to 74) received more formal social support and less informal social support compared to their parents' generation. The formal social support they received was not much different but they received less informal social support compared to the older-old (people aged 75 and over) living in the same communities. The young-old expect to receive more formal social support when they become the older-old, as the informal social support from their children would be reduced due to the one-child policy and socio-cultural changes. Conclusions: Intergenerational differences of social support for the elderly do exist in the form of instrumental, financial, and emotional support. The findings help us understand how socio-economic development and urbanization processes affect the daily life and social support of the community-living elderly from different age groups, and also provides knowledge for improving the quality of life for the elderly in Beijing. © 2018 The Authors.

Most of their financial support came from the informal support by their children. The young‐old mentioned that the health care expenses of their parents used to be a heavy burden for the family, as there was not a universal health insurance system that can cover everyone in their parents' generation.

Drawing on our research that explored women's and men's emotional geographies of an everyday exercise environment – the gym – in a Canadian city, we show how this approach can identify otherwise invisible environmental influences on physical activity participation. Our thematic analysis reveals that the gym environment is generative of three place-based emotive processes of dislocation, evaluation, and sexualisation that collectively configure an unevenly gendered emotional architecture of place. Through this interstitial structure, the boundaries of localised hierarchies of masculinities and femininities become felt in ways that create tensions and anxieties, which in turn reinforce gendered boundaries on physical activity participation. Two additional themes reveal how gendered motivation and individual factors mediate negative emotional experiences. Our findings indicate that emotional geographies are one way in which gender disparities in physical activity are naturalised at the scale of the everyday exercise environment. Interventions for gender equity in physical activity would benefit from being empathetically attuned to the subtleties of place-based experiences. More widely, bringing emotions into geographies of physical activity sheds light on the larger question of the role of place in (re)producing gendered health inequities, with implications for geographical research on health and social justice. Future critical geographical inquiry is necessary to ensure that public health interventions are grounded in the experiential realities of practising physical activity in particular places.

This paper applies binary logistic regression analysis to data on the oldest-old aged 80 years old and higher from the 2011 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS). Socioeconomic determinants of the self-reported quality of life (QoL) and self-reported health (SRH) of the oldest-old population are explored, with special attention paid to the role of residence and region. The results indicate that, after controlling for individual demographic and health behavior variables, both economic status and social welfare have a significant effect on self-reported QoL and SRH. There are also significant differences in self-reported QoL among cities, towns and rural areas, with the oldest-old respondents living in Central rural, Western town and Western rural areas being significantly less likely to report good QoL, compared to the oldest-old living in Eastern cities. Significant differences in SRH exist among Eastern China, Western China and Northeastern China, with the oldest-old from Western towns being significantly less likely to report good health, and the oldest-old from Northeastern cities being significantly more likely to report good health than those from Eastern cities. The results of this study indicate that socioeconomic factors that explain self-reported QoL and SRH of the older population are in general factors that explain the self-reported QoL and SRH of the oldest-old cohorts. The interaction effect of residence and region matters more than each of the individual factors, in providing us with more detailed information on the role of geography in explaining QoL and health of the oldest-old. At a time when the oldest-old cohorts in China are at the beginning of their projected growth, these findings are vital for providing policy makers with more information on the urgency of making more geographically targeted policy to improve more effectively the self-reported QoL and SRH of the oldest-old population. © 2019 by the authors.

Considering the relationality of differential contributions to care, we propose a conceptualisation of multiple interrelated approaches by: (1) extending the critical frameworks of care to understand the broader frames of institution, market, and morality in mediating interpersonal connectedness of elder care; (2) thinking care relationally, we challenge the dominant conceptualisation of care and power as unidirectional flows and elder care relationships as a receiver–giver dyad; (3) emplacing care, we focus on the actual conditions of care through which ethics are assembled in their geo-historical context; (4) treating care as grounded, we centre voices from both older people and LEC workers and how ethics of care are comprehended in the everyday rather than prescribed for commodified care. Our thematic analysis starts with a commodification process where LEC is negotiated in tensions; yet moving beyond arguments around systems of dominance and ideal ethics of care, findings show LEC also creates a space of care where LEC workers and older people constantly negotiate norms, boundaries, and care as a relational process. Conceptually, this paper recognises the role of power in shaping the market and intimate relationships of elder care by elaborating on the inequities of age, gender, and place (not just gender). Moving beyond critiques, this paper emphasises the entangled and relational nature of care as grounded in a series of everyday concerns and resistance, where ethics of difference are negotiated and a cultural-historical configuration of care still perpetuates in its locale. Finally, this paper speaks to the active yet overlooked role of age and ageing in constructing an ethics of care.

Under this new disciplinary framework, the focus of geographic research has gradually shifted from disease and medical services to health and well-being in a broad sense, and related studies have had a significant impact in the fields of geography and social sciences. These studies on healing share a common theoretical foundation—the concept of ""therapeutic landscape"" proposed by Gesler in 1992—and gradually developed a set of influential theories in the subsequent development, becoming a well-deserved important theoretical contribution to health geography. As a core theoretical framework of health geography, the study of therapeutic landscapes is rarely mentioned in geographic research in China. This article reviewed the theoretical development process and current research progress on the use of therapeutic landscapes since the 1990s. The therapeutic landscape concept draws on structuralist and humanistic theories of new cultural geography. Influenced by the relational turn of geography in the later period, it gradually developed into the most influential theoretical framework of health geography. Therapeutic landscape research from a relational perspective has been deeply influenced by theories such as non-representational theory, actor network theory, and the mobility turn, and has gradually developed branch theories such as therapeutic assemblage, enabling place, therapeutic mobility, and therapeutic ""taskscapes"". Finally, the article summarized some challenges in the current research on therapeutic landscapes, and put forward suggestions for the development of health geography under the framework of therapeutic landscapes in the future. © 2023, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

The social determinants of health (SDH) perspective has become a basic part of our underlying approach to research in many fields of study related to health, including serving as an important marker in the cultural turn from medical to health geography. The Government of Ghana enacted the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) into law in 2003, and the scheme was active nationwide within the next few years.

However, research on how 3D building morphology affects energy consumption at a macroscopic scale is lacking. In this study, we measured the mean building height (BH), mean building volume (BV), and mean European nearest neighbor distance (MENN) of the city to quantify the 3D building morphology. We then used a spatial regression model to analyze the quantitative impact of urban 3D building morphology on per capita electricity consumption (PCEC). Results indicate that at the macroscopic scale of the city, the BH and the MENN have a significant positive impact on the PCEC, while the BV has a significant negative impact on the PCEC. Moreover, the inclusion of the 3D building morphology greatly improves the model’s ability to explain building energy efficiency, surpassing the impact of traditional economic factors. Considering the 3D building morphology indicators together, buildings with a lower height, a larger volume, and a more compact 3D morphology have greater potential for energy savings and are more conducive to electricity conservation. This study offers valuable insights for the energy-efficient arrangement of buildings. © The Author(s) 2024.","3D building morphology; Building energy consumption; Electricity consumption; Energy conservation; Large cities in China; Spatial Durbin model","article; China; economic aspect; electricity; energy; energy conservation; energy consumption; morphology; oral drug administration; regression model; spatial regression","","","","","Yunnan Province Innovation Team Project, (202305AS350003); Yunnan Revitalization Talent Support Program” in Yunnan Province, (XDYC-QNRC-2022-0740, XDYC-WHMJ-2022-0016); Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects, (202401AT070108, 202401AS070037, 202301AT070062); Yunnan Science and Technology Program, (202305AP350016)","This research was funded by Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects (Grant Nos. 202401AT070108; 202301AT070062; 202401AS070037), Yunnan Science and Technology Program (Grant No. 202305AP350016), Yunnan Province Innovation Team Project (202305AS350003), and the \u201CYunnan Revitalization Talent Support Program\u201D in Yunnan Province (Grant Nos.

The purpose of this paper is to understand the self-perceived health and social status of skilled immigrants who were working in low-skilled jobs in the service sector in Ottawa, Canada. Design/methodology/approach - In this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews with 19 high-skilled immigrants working as taxi drivers and convenience store workers in the city of Ottawa, Canada were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Findings - Five major themes emerged from the data: high expectations but low achievements; credential devaluation, deskilling and wasted skills; discrimination and loss of identity; lifestyle change and poor health behaviour; and poor mental and physical health status. Social implications - The study demonstrates the knowledge between what skilled immigrants expect when they arrive in Canada and the reality of finding meaningful employment in a country where international credentials are less likely to be recognized. The study therefore contributes to immigration policy reform which would reduce barriers to meaningful employment among immigrants reducing the impacts on health resulting from employment in low-skilled jobs. Originality/value - This study provides unique insights into the experience and perceptions of skilled immigrants working in low-skilled jobs. It also sheds light on the ""healthy worker effect"" hypothesis which is a highly discussed and debated issue in the occupational health literature. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Canada; Health; Low-skilled jobs; Skilled immigrant; Social status; Stress","Canada; driver; expectation; grounded theory; health behavior; health status; human; human experiment; immigrant; immigration; lifestyle modification; occupational health; perception; qualitative research; semi structured interview; skill; social status; stress; worker","","","","","","","Asanin J.D., Wilson K., I spent nine years looking for a doctor': Exploring access to health care among immigrants in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, Social Science and Medicine, 66, 6, pp. 1271-1283, (2008); Asanin J.D., Wilson K., Education?

Better understanding how the spatial differences of life expectancy and longevity are affected by air pollutants is needed for generating public health and environmental strategies since the whole of China is now threatened by deteriorated air quality. 85 major city regions were chosen as research areas. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Stepwise Regression (SR) were used to find the spatial correlations between health indicators and air pollutants, adjusted by per capita GDP11GDP, gross domestic product. The results were, regions with higher life expectancy were mainly located in the east area and areas with good air quality, a regional difference of 10μg/m3 in ambient air SO222SO2, sulfur dioxide. could cause adjusted 0.28year's difference in life expectancy, a regional difference of 10μg/m3 in ambient air PM1033PM10, particular matter with diameter <10μm. could lead to a longevity ratio difference of 2.23, and per capita GDP was positively associating with life expectancy but not longevity ratio, with a regional difference of 10,000RMB44RMB, renminbi. associating with adjusted 0.49year's difference in life expectancy.

The prevalence of IPV in sub-Saharan Africa is considerably higher than the global estimate. In Ghana, it is estimated that 24% of women have experienced physical and/or sexual IPV in their lifetime. Studies point to the association between alcohol misuse by intimate male partners and violence against women. However, there has been no consideration for potential spatial variation or heterogeneity in this association. Using estimates from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey Data, we employed geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis to examine spatial variations in the relationship between male partner’s alcohol misuse and IPV among women in Ghana. We fitted three models to assess the relationship using a step-wise approach. The first model has alcohol misuse as the only predictor, whereas the second model included other male partner characteristics, such as post-secondary education and employment status. The final introduced female characteristics as additional covariates. The result of the GWR analysis shows that the effect of alcohol misuse on IPV is elevated in the south-western part of Ghana. The findings suggest the potential influence of place-based or contextual factors on the association between alcohol misuse and women’s exposure to IPV. © The Author(s) 2020.","alcohol misuse; geographically weighted regression; Ghana; intimate partner violence; women","Alcoholism; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Ghana; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Spatial Regression; adult; alcohol abuse; article; demography; education; employment status; female; geographically weighted regression; Ghana; health survey; human; male; partner violence; alcoholism; cross-sectional study; Ghana; prevalence; risk factor; sexuality; spatial regression","","","","","United States Agency for International Development, USAID","We are grateful for helpful comments from the editors and anonymous reviewers.

These have often been locations of population aging but have not had concomitant development of required community care services for older persons. This study aims to understand the perception and utilization of newly developed community care services by the older persons living in this region for providing knowledge to improve the services. Methods: Applying Andersen's behavior model, this study used binary logistic regression of the factors influencing the perception and utilization of community care services and analyzed data collected by questionnaires to 301 older persons in the new urban areas of Beijing. Results: Education, income, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, mental health, and economic needs are statistically significant factors affecting older persons' perception of community care services. Age, perception of community care services, income, neighborhood relationships, mental health, and emotional needs are significant factors affecting older persons' utilization of community care services. Conclusion: Demographic characteristics, health status, social support, and care needs were significant factors in the perception and utilization of community care services, after controlling for many variables. Improving older persons' perceptions of community care services is likely to promote their access to the services, which should help meet the challenges of rapid population aging in providing community care services to support aging in place in the new urban areas of Beijing, China. © 2023 The Authors.

The evolution and factors of home-based care utilization are the prerequisites for the formulation of a support policy. However, no extant research has studied home-based elder care on a national scale. Aim This paper aims to examine changing caregiving relationships nationwide for home-based elderly individuals and investigate the changing factors of care utilization in a ten-year period, with special attention to the effects of “location” on care patterns. Methods The data come from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Andersen and Newman's behavioral model is employed as the theoretical framework for this research. The trends in care use from 2002 to 2011 are explored and multilevel multinomial analyses are performed to investigate the changing factors of care patterns between 2002 and 2011. Results From 2002 to 2011, China saw a sharp decrease in children as caregivers, a significant increase in spousal caregivers, and a gradual decrease in other caregivers. Compared to 2002, the effects of the predisposing and enabling factors are more important than the need factors in 2011. Location and the interactions of the north-south divide and the urban-rural divide had a significant effect on care patterns. Conclusions From 2002 to 2011, there was a decline in the traditional values-advocated care system and the elderly had to rely more on their own resources to find caregivers. In the design of a support program, there is an urgent need for policy makers to take social inequality among elderly individuals and the effects of location into consideration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Home-based care; Multi-level multinomial model; Social inequality","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Caregivers; China; Female; Health Policy; Health Services Needs and Demand; Health Surveys; Home Care Services; Humans; Male; Population Dynamics; Residence Characteristics; Social Support; Urbanization; aged; Article; caregiver; China; conceptual framework; demography; female; geriatric care; health care need; health care policy; health care utilization; home care; human; longitudinal study; male; rural area; social status; spouse; transitional care; trend study; urban area; very elderly; health service; health survey; population dynamics; social support; urbanization","","","","","Center for Healthy Aging and Development Studies, Peking University; China Social Science Foundation; National Institute on Aging, NIA; United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Data used for this research was provided by the study entitled “Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey” (CLHLS) managed by the Center for Healthy Aging and Development Studies, Peking University.

Using the 2014 General Social Survey (GSS) data on Canadians’ safety, we examine neighborhood, social capital, and socioeconomic characteristics as predictors of the incidence of victimization among seniors and their satisfaction with personal safety from crime. Generally, seniors with poor neighborhood ties and social capital were more likely to have experienced victimization and have a lower satisfaction with personal safety. Seniors who viewed people in their neighborhood as unhelpful were more likely to have experienced some form of victimization and more likely to have a lower satisfaction with personal safety. Highly educated and high-income seniors were also more likely to have experienced some form of victimization. Paradoxically, such seniors were less likely to have lower satisfaction with personal safety. The results also show that place, defined as population centers (urban and rural) may have a significant influence on variations in victimization and satisfaction with personal safety. A significant proportion of the variance in victimization (38%) and satisfaction with personal safety (23%) are largely the result of differences in place of residence (urban and rural). Our findings suggest that there is the need to improve neighborhood social capital, reduce neighborhood disorder and improve the socioeconomic status of community-dwelling seniors in order to minimize their susceptibility to victimization as well as to improve their sense of safety from crime. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Canada; Multilevel analysis; Seniors; Sense of safety; Victimization","Aged; Canada; Crime; Crime Victims; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Residence Characteristics; Social Capital; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Canada; crime; elderly care; elderly population; neighborhood; safety; social capital; socioeconomic status; article; Canada; Canadian; crime; highest income group; human; incidence; multilevel analysis; neighborhood; satisfaction; social capital; aged; Canada; crime victim; cross-sectional study; demography; female; male; questionnaire; social capital; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data","","","","","Canada Research Chairs","We are grateful for helpful comments from the editors and anonymous reviewers.

Despite geographical variation in physical activity participation and gender differences across types of physical activities, physical activity is frequently assessed at national scales using only select indicators. Using 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey data, we undertake a gender-based analysis using cross tabulations, chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression models to investigate whether gender differences in physical activity vary across geographical scales and physical activity types in Canada. We examine: (1) whether gender gaps in physical activity change across geographical scale (national, provincial, city); (2) if any geographical variation in gender differences varies by activity type (active leisure time, weight-training, home exercises); (3) whether age and/or income help to explain geographical variation in gender differences in physical activity; and (4) if gender, age, marital status, education, and income level predict variation in differences in physical activity at different geographical scales. Results demonstrate that both scale and activity type matter for how gender differences in physical activity are observed. By zooming in or out, or by changing the activity lens, gender gaps emerged or disappeared. We conclude that physical activity interventions need to be gender-sensitive in ways that are place-specific.

In China, there are many climate types. According to national population censuses from 1982 to 2000, most provinces with a high ratio of centenarians are located in western and northwestern China far from the sea; these areas are characterized by a dry, cold climate, very high altitude, very high daily temperature range, strong winds, and partial hypoxia. Meanwhile, provinces with a high ratio of nonagenarians from 1982 to 2000 are located in southern China near the sea. Previous studies have attributed the high ratio of centenarians in western and northwestern China to the extreme local climate. However, centenarians in these areas decreased greatly in 2010, whereas residents in southern China frequently reached 90 to 100 years old in 2010. This study aims to explain this strange phenomenon and find whether extreme climate in Tibetan plateau and northwestern China or moderate climate in southern China is more conducive to longevity. The study found that mortality rate in Tibetan plateau is much higher than southern China, then a population evolution experiment was proposed to compare longevity indicators between low mortality rate and high mortality rate and shows that longevity indicators will decrease in the near future and increase above their original levels after several decades when the mortality rate is decreased. Results of this study show individuals in northwestern China do not live as long as those in eastern and southern China. A moderate climate is more conducive to longevity than extreme climate in China. The longevity of a region should be judged by long-term longevity indicators. © 2018, ISB.","Centenarian; Extreme climate; Hypoxia; Longevity zone; Moderate climate; Mortality rate","Aged; China; Climate; Humans; Longevity; Mortality; aged; China; climate; human; longevity; mortality","","","","","Key Laboratory Foundation of Nantong City; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (201710304036, BK20150405)","Funding information This study is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20150405), the National Students’ Innovation Training Program for undergraduate students (No. 201710304036) and Key Laboratory Foundation of Nantong City (No. CP12016005).","Ballester F., Michelozzi P., Iniguez C., Weather, climate and public health, J Epidemiol Community Health, 57, pp. 759-760, (2003); Basu R., High ambient temperature and mortality: a review of epidemiologic studies from 2001 to 2008, Environ Health, 8, 1, (2009); Bell M.L., O'Neill M.S., Ranjit N., Borja-Aburto V.H., Cifuentes L.A., Gouveia N.C., Vulnerability to heat-related mortality in Latin America: a case-crossover study in São Paulo, Brazil, Santiago, Chile and Mexico City, Mexico, Int J Epidemiol, 37, 4, pp. 796-804, (2008); Braga A.L., Zanobetti A., Schwartz J., The time course of weather-related deaths, Epidemiology, 12, 6, pp. 662-667, (2001); Braga A.L., Zanobetti A., Schwartz J., The effect of weather on respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in 12 U.S. cities, Environ Health Perspect, 110, 9, pp. 859-863, (2002); Chen K., Zhou L., Chen X., Urbanization level and vulnerability to heat-related mortality in Jiangsu Province, China, Environ Health Perspect, 124, 12, pp. 1863-1869, (2016); Tabulation of the 2010 population census of China, (2000); Tabulation of the 2010 population census of China, (2010); Dimitriou K., McGregor G., Kassomenos P., Paschalidou A., Exploring winter mortality variability in five regions of England, using back trajectory analysis, Earth Interact, 20, 1, pp. 1-27, (2016); Go'mez-Acebo I., Dierssen-Sotos T., Llorca J., Effect of cold temperatures on mortality in Cantabria (Northern Spain): a case-crossover study, Public Health, 124, pp. 398-403, (2010); Heaviside C., Tsangari H., Paschalidou A., Et al., Heat-related mortality in Cyprus for current and future climate scenarios, Sci Total Environ, 569-570, pp. 627-633, (2016); Hertel S., Le Tertre A., Jockel K.H., Hoffmann B., Quantification of the heat wave effect on cause-specific mortality in Essen, Germany, Eur J Epidemiol, 24, 8, pp. 407-414, (2009); Kalkstein L.S., Greene J.S., An evaluation of climate/mortality relationship in large U.S. cities and the possible impacts of a climate change, Environ Health Perspect, 105, pp. 84-93, (1997); Lv J.M., Wang W.Y., Li Y.H., Effects of environmental factors on the longevous people in China, Arch Gerontol Geriatr, 53, 2, pp. 200-205, (2011); Ma W., Yang C., Chu C., Li T., Tan J., Kan H., The impact of the 2008 cold spell on mortality in Shanghai, China, Int J Biometeorol, 57, 1, pp. 179-184, (2013); Magnolfi S.U., Petruzzi E., Pinzani P., Et al., Longevity index (LI%) and centenarity index (CI%): new indicators to evaluate the characteristics of aging process in the Italian population, Arch Gerontol Geriatr, 44, pp. 271-276, (2007); Magnolfi S.U., Noferi I., Petruzzi E., Et al., Centenarians in Tuscany: the role of the environment factors, Arch Gerontol Geriatr, 48, pp. 263-266, (2009); Paschalidou A.K., Kassomenos P.A., McGregor G.R., Analysis of the synoptic winter mortality climatology in five regions of England: searching for evidence of weather signals, Sci Total Environ, 598, pp. 432-444, (2017); Population Census of China in 1982.

In this study, we ask how obstacles in the urban environment are associated with the need for help to go to places in the community. To respond to this question, we used the Annual Household Survey of the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina 2018, which had a specific questionnaire for people with disabilities. From this sample, we selected adults aged 65 years or older with difficulties in at least one of six domains: vision; hearing; upper and lower body mobility; cognition; self-care; and communication. The final sample consisted of 513 persons (weighted = 109,316). First, we conducted a principal component analysis identifying three factors from variables of obstacles to access and use the urban environment: transportation; outdoor spaces; and information. Second, through a logistic regression model, we observed a direct relationship between these factors and the need for help to move in the community, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and number of disabilities. This paper provides evidence on the significance of improving urban spaces to reduce dependent mobility. In Latin America, cities still face many challenges in becoming more age-friendly. © 2021 by the authors.

Incremental multivariate logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models assessed the relationship between selected predictors, overnight admission, and duration of stay. The findings show that all chronic health conditions and socio-economic factors examined were significantly associated with overnight hospital admission. However, seniors with cardiovascular health conditions, the very old, and seniors living in lower-income households had a greater risk of longer stays. Canadian seniors diagnosed with hypertension, cancer, diabetes, and stroke had greater risk of longer overnight hospital stays. Seniors aged 75 to 79 years, 80 years or older, and those living in lower-income households (≤ $39,999) were more likely to have a longer overnight hospital stay. Findings suggest that improving seniors' health and socio-economic status may reduce the risk of overnight admission and longer stays of hospitalisation.  © Canadian Association on Gerontology 2020.","ageing; CCHS; chronic health conditions; hospitalisation; seniors; socio-economic status","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Canada; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors; aged; Canada; chronic disease; cross-sectional study; female; health survey; human; length of stay; male; risk assessment; socioeconomics; very elderly","","","","","Canada Research Chairs","We are grateful for helpful comments from the editors and anonymous reviewers.

Such plans, however, often fail to account for the wide diversity of older people in cities, with the result that some older people, including Indigenous older people, do not see their needs reflected in age-friendly planning and policies. This article reports on a study involving 10 older First Nations and Métis women in the city of Prince George, Canada, comparing the expressed needs of these women with two age-friendly action plans: that of the city of Prince George, and that of the Northern Health Authority. Four main categories were raised in a group discussion and interview with these women at the Prince George Native Friendship Centre: availability of health care services, accessibility and affordability of programs and services, special roles of Indigenous Elders, and experiences of racism and discrimination. There are many areas of synergy between the needs expressed by the women and the two action plans; however, certain key areas are missing from the action plans; in particular, specific strategies for attending to the needs of Indigenous and other older populations who often feel marginalized in health care and in age-friendly planning.  © ","age-friendly communities; aging; Indigenous people; Prince George; qualitative research","Aged; Aging; Canada; Cities; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Indigenous Peoples; aged; aging; article; Canada; city; controlled study; exploratory research; female; First Nation; friendship; human; interview; practice guideline; qualitative research; racism; World Health Organization; aging; Canada; city; health care delivery","","","","","","","An overview of First Nations Health Governance in Northern British Columbia, (2014); Welcome to the Aboriginal Housing Society of Prince George., (2018); Barrera J., Vancouver Island hospital named in allegations of racist 'game' that sparked investigation, (2020); Baskin C., Davey .

Methods: Beijing hospital was picked as the surveillance area, and self-report questionnaires from the AR patients and data from medical examinations by specialists of otolaryngology were collected. The burden of patients with AR was evaluated by the combined results from patient-questionnaires and specialist examination reports. Results: AR imposed a substantial burden on patients regarding everyday life limitations and work performance; AR affected patients' noses, ears, throats, and eyes in various ways. The basic daily average medicine cost was 10 RMB for each patient, and the cost for an outpatient in the hospital was 10 RMB for a basic nasal examination and more than 200 RMB if the patient needed further physical examinations. Conclusions: AR imposed burdens on everyday activities and work performance; the patients needed to wait a long time before being diagnosed, and the costs of diagnosis and treatment imposed economic burden on patients. © 2017 by the authors.","Allergic rhinitis; Beijing; Disease burden; Outpatients","Beijing [China]; China; allergy; disease incidence; financial crisis; hospital sector; medicine; questionnaire survey; symptom","","","","","","","Pawankar R., Canonica G., Holgate S., Lockey R., Wao White Book on Allergy, pp. 1-216, (2011); Bousquet J., Khaltaev N., Cruz A.A., Denburg J., Fokkens W.J., Togias A., Zuberbier T., Baena-Cagnani C.E., Canonica G.W., Van Weel C., Et al., Allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) 2008, Allergy, 63, pp. 8-160, (2008); Terreehorst I., Hak E., Oosting A.J., Tempels-Pavlica Z., de Monchy J.G., Bruijnzeel-Koomen C.A., Aalberse R.C., vanWijk R.G., Evaluation of impermeable covers for bedding in patients with allergic rhinitis, N.

There is little knowledge of the possible association between social capital and depression among the growing older population in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigates the effect of cognitive social capital (trust and sense of safety) and structural social capital (social participation or engagement in social activities) on depression among older adults in Ghana. Utilizing multilevel mixed-effect analysis, we investigate the effect of individual-level and neighborhood-level social capital (cognitive and structural) on depression using data from the World Health Organization Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE) survey (Wave 1). The findings show that at an individual level, older adults who felt safe at home were less likely to have depression. We observed mixed results for elements of structural social capital at the individual level. Older adults who frequently engaged in club or group meetings, worked with neighbors and engaged in social outings were more likely to have depression; while attending public meetings and socializing with co-workers were associated with reduced likelihood of having depression. At the neighborhood level, increased trust in neighbors was associated with an increased likelihood of having depression (OR = 1.01, p < 0.05) while higher levels of neighborhood safety and structural social capital were associated with a reduced likelihood of having depression. The findings suggest that the differential associations between elements of social capital and depression may be the result of contextual factors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","chronic health; individual-level social capital; neighborhood-level social capital; socioeconomic status","Aged; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Ghana; Humans; Multilevel Analysis; Residence Characteristics; Social Capital; Social Support; adult; aged; aging; article; controlled study; coworker; cross-sectional study; female; Ghana; human; male; neighborhood; social capital; social participation; social status; structure activity relation; trust; World Health Organization; cognition; cross-sectional study; demography; depression; Ghana; multilevel analysis; social support","","","","","BERTHA; Danish Big Data Centre for Environment and Health; Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research; Novo Nordisk Foundation Challenge Programme, (NNF17OC0027864); World Health Organization, WHO; Canada Research Chairs","Funding text 1: We are grateful for helpful comments from the editor and anonymous reviewers.

A thematic analytical technique was used to analyse the data. Seven key themes emerged: access to social support; caregiving burden; abuse and discrimination; ill health; increased dependence on available institutional support programs; and personal coping strategies. Our findings suggest that the absence of adult children negatively affects older people left behind. We recommend more social welfare programs and a retooling of current social protection programs to meet the complex and evolving needs of older adults left behind. © 2022 The African Specialty Group of the American Association of Geographers.","ecological systems theory; Ghana; migration; older adults; Upper West Region","","","","","","Canada Research Chairs; Queen's University","We want to thank the Research Assistants and community leaders in Ghana for helping with the data collection.

The data for the study comes from a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 273 sub-Saharan African immigrants living in the GTA. ~ 21% of respondents surveyed had unmet TCAM needs in the 12-month period prior to the survey. Persons with chronic health conditions, lower socioeconomic status, and those with previous history of TCAM use before immigrating were more likely to have unmet TCAM need. The study suggests that the current TCAM healthcare environment in the GTA limits that ability of sub-Saharan immigrants to meet their healthcare needs, especially persons in most need of such treatments—persons with chronic health conditions and those of lower socioeconomic background. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Canada; complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM); Immigrants; Sub-saharan africans; Traditional; Unmet healthcare needs","Africa South of the Sahara; Complementary Therapies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Africa south of the Sahara; alternative medicine; cross-sectional study; human; questionnaire; socioeconomics","","","","","Canada Research Chairs","Professor Mark Rosenberg is the Tier I Canada Research Chair in Development Studies.

The current generation of older Chinese has experienced the transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economy. Urban changes have taken place in various ways. This study explains the spatio-temporal processes of older people with their changing places by conducting in-depth interviews with 47 older people living at home in Beijing. Their generational consciousness and old place identities are deeply rooted in pre-reform Collectivism and shaped by socialist ideologies of the past. The representation of the old identity among older people is circumscribed by their living situations and selectively manifested. In most cases, there are limited mechanisms formed to recreate positive place meanings and reintegrate older people and place. The processes reflect the growing social inequality and changing cultural values in a society in transition. Growing social inequality and changing cultural values have a great impact on older people's health and well-being. © 2017","Aging; Place; Urban China; Well-being","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Beijing; Culture; Female; Humans; Independent Living; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Residence Characteristics; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; aging; cultural change; elderly population; health status; income distribution; policy reform; political ideology; urban geography; urban society; aging; anticipation; Article; China; cultural value; financial management; human; interview; marketing; practice guideline; priority journal; social aspect; social inequality; urban area; wellbeing; aged; cultural anthropology; demography; female; independent living; male; middle aged; social environment; socioeconomics; very elderly","","","","","","","Andrews G.J., Kearns R.A., Everyday health histories and the making of place: the case of an English coastal town, Social.

There is a need for more research to disentangle the complexity within housing types and between housing and socioeconomic development as they influence health. To enhance the evidence base for the understanding of the association between housing and health, from a geographic perspective, we applied spatial multilevel analyses to census and statistical yearbook data of China to investigate what and how housing conditions were associated with life expectancy at birth (LEB). The results found significant spatial auto-correlation of LEB across nearby counties and significant spatial clustering of LEB across provinces. Spatial multilevel models fit the data better than regular regression models. Housing conditions, including housing tenure and internal housing quality, were significantly associated with LEB independent of socioeconomic factors. Compared to access to clean energy and tap water, where the associations with LEB were conditional on housing tenure, having a washroom inside the house, crowding and housing tenure were robustly related to LEB. The associations between internal housing quality and LEB were confounded by housing tenure. The coefficients of housing facilities decreased or became insignificant and the coefficients of crowding increased after housing tenure was considered. Housing tenure might be one of the mediators of the economy to indirectly impact LEB, and an independent social indicator which might affect LEB directly. The associations between housing conditions and LEB were stronger in counties situated in less-developed provinces. These findings indicate that, to narrow regional gaps in life expectancy, improving the housing facilities in the least developed regions should be a priority. With rapid urbanization and the vast migration, ensuring urban dwellers have access to houses and reducing housing congestion should be the primary policy concerns all over China, but especially in the less-developed regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; County; Housing conditions; Life expectancy at birth; Spatial multilevel model","China; birth rate; complexity; housing conditions; housing policy; life expectancy; socioeconomic conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41901179); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (GHJ-ZLZX-2018-14); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2018M640171)","This study was funded by the Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41901179 ), the Chinese Academy of Sciences Special Program (No. GHJ-ZLZX-2018-14 ), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018M640171 ).

Although volunteer-based organizations provide community support services across a range of Western countries, little attention has been directed towards understanding the organization and actions of volunteers and voluntarism in dementia care. To address this gap, we conducted a case study of Alzheimer support organizations in Ontario, Canada, using questionnaires with service providers (N=20) and semi-structured interviews with people with dementia (N=46) and partners in care (N=43). In our analysis, we identify challenges related to increasing demands for support, partner relations, reaching rural communities, a lack of early stage supports, a lack of volunteers for programs that families have requested, and loss of volunteers in programs families depended on. Moreover, we argue that the current model of voluntary sector service provision for people living with dementia is unevenly developed and potentially unsustainable. © 2016","Care and caregiving; Dementia; Older people; Rural; Voluntary sector","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Caregivers; Dementia; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Interprofessional Relations; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Organizational Case Studies; Organizations, Nonprofit; Respite Care; Rural Health Services; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Volunteers; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; elderly care; elderly population; health care; mental health; rural area; service provision; voluntary approach; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; Canada; case study; clinical article; controlled study; dementia; female; human; male; middle aged; priority journal; questionnaire; rural health care; rural population; semi structured interview; sociology; support group; very elderly; voluntary program; volunteer; Alzheimer disease; caregiver; dementia; health care delivery; health services research; interview; non profit organization; Ontario; organization and management; psychology; public relations; respite care; rural health care; social support; volunteer","","","","","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR","The research herein was funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research .

Yet much of what we know about geographical disparities in access comes from studies of regional and urban/rural contrasts, or from studies of intra-urban, neighborhood-level variations. We know relatively little about variations in access to primary health care across different urban areas, and whether such variations translate into differences among residents health. This study examines how health status and access to primary care vary across five of Canadas largest cities, paying particular attention to populations that may be particularly vulnerable based on age and income. Across all outcomes, there was a consistently strong relationship with individual socioeconomic status. We show that city of residence is important for access to health care but not for health status. Results are discussed in terms of their relevance for urban health-care policy and delivery, and impacts on health and access to care. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","access to health care; geographies of health; inequality; large cities; urban health","","","","","","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (201302MFE-300183-205287)","This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research under a Postdoctoral Fellowship held by the first author [grant number 201302MFE-300183-205287].","Arild A., Holmas Tor H., Access to primary health care and health outcomes: The relationships between GP characteristics and mortality rates, Journal of Health Economics, 25, pp. 1139-1153, (2006); Aday Lu A., Ronald A., A framework for the study of access to medical care, Health Services Research, 9, pp. 208-220, (1974); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, (2005); Diane A., Denise C., Health service utilization among older adults in British Columbia: Making sense of geography, Canadian Journal on Aging, 25, 2, pp. 219-232, (2006); Ronald A., Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care Does it matter?, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 36, 1, pp. 1-10, (1995); Ronald A., Aday Lu A., Access to medical care in the US: Realized and potential, Medical Care, 16, pp. 533-546, (1978); Jennifer A., Kathi W., I spent nine years looking for a doctor Exploring access to health care among immigrants in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, Social Science & Medicine, 66, pp. 1271-1283, (2008); Jaya A., John O.E., Ayanian John Z., Neighborhood characteristics associated with access to patient-centered medical homes for children, Health Affairs, 30, 11, pp. 2080-2089, (2011); Collins Patricia A., Hayes Michael V., The role of urban municipal governments in reducing health inequities: A meta-narrative mapping analysis, International Journal for Equity in Health, 9, (2010); Crooks Valorie A., Nadine S., Interpreting the results of a modified gravity model: Examining access to primary health care physicians in five Canadian provinces and territories, BMC Health Services Research, 12, (2012); Curtis Lori J., MacMinn William J., Health care utilization in Canada: Twenty-five years of evidence, Canadian Public Policy, 34, 1, pp. 65-87, (2008); Jishnu D., Jeffrey H., Location, location, location: Residence, wealth, and the quality of medical care in Delhi, India, Health Affairs, 26, 3, pp. w338-w351, (2007); Gorey Kevin M., Luginaah Isaac N., Fung Karen Y., Emma B., Caroline H., Wright Frances C., Holowaty Eric J., Physician supply and breast cancer survival, The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 23, 1, pp. 104-108, (2010); Local Community Service Centres, (2014); Harrington Daniel W., Kathi W., Scott B., Nazeem M., Jesse R., Realizing neighbourhood potential? the role of the availability of health care services on contact with a primary care physician, Health & Place, 18, pp. 814-823, (2012); Harrington Daniel W., Kathi W., Rosenberg Mark W., Scott B., Access granted! barriers endure: Determinants of difficulties accessing specialist care when required in Ontario, Canada, 13; BMC Health Services Research Canada Health Act Ottawa: The Queen's Printer 2013, (1984); Isaacs Stephen L., Schroeder Steven A., Class - The ignored determinant of the nation's health, The New England Journal of Medicine, 351, 11, pp. 1137-1142, (2004); Marina K., Literature review Healthy cities: A guide to literature, Public Health Reports, 115, pp. 279-289, (2000); Kirby James B., Poor people, poor places and access to health care in the United States, Social Forces, 87, 1, pp. 325-355, (2008); Kirby James B., Toshiko K., Access to health care Does neighborhood residential instability matter?, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 47, 2, pp. 142-155, (2006); Lasser Karen E., Himmelstein David U., Steffie W., Access to care, health status, and health disparities in the United States and Canada: Results of a cross-national population-based survey, American Journal of Public Health, 96, 7, pp. 1300-1307, (2006); Thomas L., Keshia P., Roland T., Ruth F., Darrell G., Place, not race: Disparities dissipate in southwest Baltimore when blacks and whites live under similar conditions, Health Affairs, 30, 10, pp. 1880-1887, (2011); Michael L., Kathi W., John E., Susan E., Michael J., Tina M., Isaac L., Meeting health need, accessing health care: The role of neighbourhood, Health & Place, 11, pp. 367-377, (2005); Lopez-Cevallos Daniel F., Chunhuei C., Assessing the context of health care utilization in Ecuador: A spatial and multilevel analysis, BMC Health Services Research, 10, 64, (2010); James M., Barbara S., Temitope E., The impact of primary healthcare on population health in low- and middle-income countries, Journal of Ambulatory Care and Management, 32, 2, pp. 150-171, (2009); James M., Barbara S., Leiyu S., Is primary care effective?.

However, the relation between temperature effects and permanent settlements of older migrants remains unclear. Based on the data obtained from China Migrants Dynamic Survey, this paper examined how four temperature effects (i.e., cold effect, heat effect, temperature gap effect, and temperature zone effect) play a role in shaping older migrants’ intentions to settle permanently in a destination place by conducting logistic regression analysis. Our findings show that: (1) extreme cold (rather than extreme heat or mild temperature) was found to have significant effects on settlement intentions of older people; (2) relative winter temperature between origin and destination places rather than absolute winter temperature in the destination place has a significant positive effect on the settlement intentions; (3) spatially, older migrants tend to migrate to geographically adjacent temperature zones. Our findings will inform a more effective planning and allocation of services for supporting older people by better understanding trends and intentions of older migrants. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper draws insights from ecological systems theory and the “geographies of older people” literature to examine the lived experiences of older people in Ghana. Data for the study were gathered using interviews (42) and sharing circles (10). Our findings reveal a complex mix of experiences consistent with the different levels of the environment. Dominant themes include access to social support, functional impairment and poor health status, social status, poor access to water and sanitation services, food insecurity, economic insecurity, and caregiving burden. These findings support the wide-held notion that the experiences of older people are complex and produced by the interplay of both individual and structural factors. Our findings demonstrate that sociocultural, economic, political, and climatic factors are important consideration in promoting elderly wellbeing and quality of life in Ghana. © 2021 by the authors.

However, data on what factors are associated with healthcare utilization among informal caregivers of older adults are not known in a sub-Saharan African context. Guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM), the principal objective of this study was to examine the association between the dimensions of the HBM and healthcare utilization among informal caregivers of older adults in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Methods: Data were extracted from a large cross-sectional study of informal caregiving, health, and healthcare survey among caregivers of older adults aged 50 years or above (N = 1,853; mean age of caregivers = 39.15 years; and mean age of care recipients = 75.08 years) in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the association between the dimensions of the HBM and healthcare utilization among informal caregivers of older adults. Statistical significance of the test was set at a probability level of 0.05 or less. Results: The results showed that 72.9% (n = 1351) of the participants were females, 56.7% (n = 1051) were urban informal caregivers and 28.6% (n = 530) had no formal education. The results further showed that 49.4% (n = 916) of the participants utilized healthcare for their health problems at least once in the past year before the survey. The final analysis showed a positive and statistically significant association between perceived susceptibility to a health problem (β = 0.054, IRR = 1.056, 95% CI = [1.041–1.071]), cues to action (β = 0.076, IRR = 1.079, 95% CI = [1.044–1.114]), self-efficacy (β = 0.042, IRR = 1.043, 95% CI = [1.013–1.074]) and healthcare utilization among informal caregivers of older adults. The study further revealed a negative and statistically significant association between perceived severity of a health problem and healthcare utilization (β= − 0.040, IRR = 0.961, 95% CI= [0.947-0.975]) among informal caregivers of older adults. The results again showed that non-enrollment in a health insurance scheme (β= − 0.174, IRR = 0.841, 95% CI= [0.774-0.913]) and being unemployed (β= − 0.088, IRR = 0.916, 95% CI= [0.850-0.986]) were statistically significantly associated with a lower log count of healthcare utilization among informal caregivers of older adults. Conclusion: The findings of this study to a large extent support the dimensions of the HBM in explaining healthcare utilization among informal caregivers of older adults in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Although all the dimensions of the HBM were significantly associated with healthcare utilization in Model 1, perceived barriers to care-seeking and perceived benefits of care-seeking were no longer statistically significant after controlling for demographic, socio-economic and health-related variables in the final model. The findings further suggest that the dimensions of the HBM as well as demographic, socio-economic and health-related factors contribute to unequal healthcare utilization among informal caregivers of older adults in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Ghana; Health Belief Model; Healthcare utilization; Informal caregivers; Older adults","","","","","","","","Roth D.L., Fredman L., Haley W.E., Informal caregiving and its impact on health: a reappraisal from population-based studies, Gerontologist, 55, 2, pp. 309-319, (2015); Bom J., Bakx P., Schut F., Van Doorslaer E., The impact of informal caregiving for older adults on the health of various types of caregivers: a systematic review, Gerontologist, 59, 5, pp. e629-e642, (2019); Nemcikova M., Katreniakova Z., Nagyova I., Social support, positive caregiving experience, and caregiver burden in informal caregivers of older adults with Dementia, Front Public Health, 11, (2023); Verbakel E., Metzelthin S.F., Kempen G.I., Caregiving to older adults: determinants of informal caregivers’ subjective well-being and formal and informal support as alleviating conditions, The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, 73, 6, pp. 1099-1111, (2018); Tur-Sinai A., Teti A., Rommel A., Hlebec V., Yghemonos S., Lamura G., Cross-national data on informal caregivers of older people with long-term care needs in the European population: Time for a more coordinated and comparable approach, J Biosoc Sci, pp. 1-5, (2022); Lam W.W.Y., Nielsen K., Sprigg C.A., Kelly C.M., The demands and resources of working informal caregivers of older people: A systematic review, Work & Stress, pp. 1-23, (2022); Longacre M.L., Valdmanis V.G., Handorf E.A., Fang C.Y., Work impact and emotional stress among informal caregivers for older adults, Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 72, 3, pp. 522-531, (2017); Lee K., Revelli M., Dickson D., Marier P., Who cares?

Although insight from existing studies suggests plausible pathways between ambient air pollution exposure and stunting, there are limited studies on the effect of different ambient air pollutants on stunting among children. Objective: Explore the effect of early-life environmental exposures on stunting among children under the age of five years. Methods: In this study, we used pooled health and population data from 33 countries in SSA between 2006 and 2019 and environmental data from the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group and NASA’s GIOVANNI platform. We estimated the association between early-life environmental exposures and stunting in three exposure periods – in-utero (during pregnancy), post-utero (after pregnancy to current age) and cumulative (from pregnancy to current age), using Bayesian hierarchical modelling. We also visualise the likelihood of stunting among children based on their region of residence using Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Results: The findings show that 33.6% of sampled children were stunted. In-utero PM2.5 was associated with a higher likelihood of stunting (OR = 1.038, CrI = 1.002–1.075). Early-life exposures to nitrogen dioxide and sulphate were robustly associated with stunting among children. The findings also show spatial variation in a high and low likelihood of stunting based on a region of residence. Impact Statement: This study explores the effect of early-life environmental exposures on child growth or stunting among sub-Saharan African children. The study focuses on three exposure windows – pregnancy, after birth and cumulative exposure during pregnancy and after birth. The study also employs spatial analysis to assess the spatial burden of stunted growth in relation to environmental exposures and socioeconomic factors. The findings suggest major air pollutants are associated with stunted growth among children in sub-Saharan Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc. 2023.","Air pollution; Bayesian models; Demographic and Health Survey (DHS); Malnutrition; Risk exposure","Africa South of the Sahara; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bayes Theorem; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Growth Disorders; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; adverse event; Africa south of the Sahara; air pollutant; air pollution; Bayes theorem; environmental exposure; epidemiology; etiology; female; growth disorder; human; infant; male; newborn; particulate matter; pregnancy; prenatal exposure delayed effect; preschool child","","Air Pollutants, ; Particulate Matter, ","","","United States Agency for International Development, USAID; NASA’s Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center; Big Data Centre for Environment and Health; Canada Research Chairs; Novo Nordisk Foundation Challenge Programme, (NNF17OC0027864)","Funding text 1: Prince M.

In Beijing, older people’s immediate environments have seen great changes and are important for their everyday aging experiences. This study explains the changing relationships between older people and their living environments by conducting in-depth interviews with 47 older people living at home in Beijing. Results show that older people’s perceptions of their living environments can be categorized by their relocation experience, residential and neighborhood type. Growing housing inequality in post-reform urban China reflects how older people assess their built environments changes. Social relations have changed tremendously with the formation of new social and residential spaces in the city, especially for those who have relocated to different types of residences. Current urban spaces create a sense of insecurity for the older generation that is familiar with the previous Work-unit system. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Methods: From a health geographical perspective, we conceptualize community as enabling places that are produced by the interaction of material, social, and symbolic resources. Focusing on a community-based care centre (CBCC) in Beijing, China, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 older persons to examine how a CBCC enabled AIC. Results: The CBCC site created three interdependent spaces and material/social/affective resources for enabling AIC: (1)living space (residential care beds) to create a sense of connection and safety; (2) a CBCC-supported care space at home to create an atmosphere of trust and safety; and (3) a social space to create feelings of belonging and contribution. Variations in how the three resources interacted produced not only different spaces at the same site for various users but also different AIC experiences for the same user. Conclusions: Community is not simply a static research context or spatial container. Rather, community as an enabling place involves a dynamic process in which spatial/social/affective resources are encountered and interact. Older people's AIC experiences change as their encounters change in the three types of resources we described and thus their capacities for ageing well change correspondingly. Furthermore, the binary idea of community versus institution needs to be expanded to explore how home, community, and institution are related, in order to create enabling spaces for AIC. © 2022 AJA Inc’.","ageing well; China; community care networks; community-dwelling; human geography","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Beijing; China; Humans; cyclobutanecarbonylcarnitine; aged; aging; China; human; very elderly","","cyclobutanecarbonylcarnitine, ","","","Professor Shiufai Wong at Macao Polytechnic Institute; Queen's University; China Scholarship Council, CSC","Funding text 1: The authors thank Professor Shiufai Wong at Macao Polytechnic Institute, Professor Qingwen XU at New York University, and Professor Heying Zhan at Georgia State University, for their insightful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

However, it is unclear to what extent different commuting behaviors are a source of air pollution compared to non-commuters, and if air pollution exposure actually differs by the mode of commuting. This study aimed to examine the relationships between commuting behaviors and air pollution exposure levels measured by urinary 1-OHP (1-hydroxypyrene), a biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Methods: A cross-sectional study of 174 volunteers living in Montreal, 92 females and 82 males, aged 20 to 53. years was conducted in 2011. Each participant completed a questionnaire regarding demographic factors, commuting behaviors, home and workplace addresses, and potential sources of PAH exposure, and provided a complete first morning void urine sample for 1-OHP analysis. Multivariable general linear regression models were used to examine the relationships between different types of commuting and urinary 1-OHP levels. Results: Compared to non-commuters, commuters traveling by foot or bicycle and by car or truck had a significantly higher urinary 1-OHP concentration in urine (p. = 0.01 for foot or bicycle vs. non-commuters; p. = 0.02 for car or truck vs. non-commuters); those traveling with public transportation and combinations of two or more types of modes tended to have an increased 1-OHP level in urine (p. = 0.06 for public transportation vs. non-commuters; p. = 0.05 for commuters with combinations of two or more types of modes vs. non-commuters). No significant difference in urinary 1-OHP variation was found by mode of commuting. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that despite the mode of commuting, all types of commuting during rush hours increase exposure to air pollution as measured by a sensitive PAH metabolite biomarker, and mode of commuting did not explain exposure variation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","1-OHP; Air pollution; Commuters; Commuting behavior; PAH; Transportation","Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Automobiles; Biological Markers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Pyrenes; Quebec; Transportation; Young Adult; Canada; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]; Air pollution; Body fluids; Regression analysis; Transportation; Trucks; 1 hydroxypyrene; creatinine; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; 1-hydroxypyrene; air pollutant; biological marker; particulate matter; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene derivative; 1-OHP; Air pollution exposures; Commuters; Commuting behavior; General linear regression models (GLM); Outdoor air pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Public transportation; atmospheric pollution; commuting; PAH; pollutant source; pollution exposure; public transport; road transport; traffic emission; adult; air pollution; Article; attitude; Canada; commuting behavior; controlled study; creatinine urine level; cross-sectional study; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; human; male; middle aged; population exposure; questionnaire; urban population; urinalysis; urine level; young adult; air pollutant; air pollution; car; environmental exposure; metabolism; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; traffic and transport; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","","1 hydroxypyrene, 5315-79-7; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; 1-hydroxypyrene, ; Air Pollutants, ; Biological Markers, ; Particulate Matter, ; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic, ; Pyrenes, ","","","Cancer Research Society, CRS; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR","This work was funded by the Cancer Research Society (Montreal) 2009–2011.

In this study, walking preferences are analyzed taking into account the built environment, network design, and safety features for 15 intermediate-sized Iranian cities. Using a stated preference survey, a sample of more than 3600 work-trip cases was created and multinomial logit modeling was employed to determine significant contributing factors to a preference to walk. The findings indicate that network design variables have the greatest impact on the changes in walking mode choices, and improving them will increase walking choices by more than double. Safety variables increase walking choices by about 12%. Built environment factors only increase walking by about 9%. The results demonstrate that variables such as the level of traffic stress, intersections traffic control, pedestrian utilities, street network connectivity, and marked crosswalks and pedestrian bridges have the most influence on choosing to walk. Also, the modal shift analysis shows that changes in the quality of the variable groups have substantial effects on the choice to walk. Investments in upgrading the built environment, network design, and safety could lead to more than 47% of trips shifting from buses and private cars to walking. The proposed choice behavior analysis framework can be applied to active travel planning and policy evaluation. This research contributes to the growing debate about how to best assess, and model different approaches to active travel development for better public policy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Built environments; Choice modeling; Networks design; Stated preference experiment; Traffic safety; Walking","Iran; commuting; experiment; network design; pedestrian; transportation safety; urban planning; walking","","","","","","","Adamowicz W.L., BoxalJ P.C., Louviere J.J., Swait J., Williams M., Stated preference methods for environmental valuation, Department of Rural Economy, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Alberta, 94, (1994); Alawadi K., Khanal A., Doudin A., Abdelghani R., Revisiting transit-oriented development: alleys as critical walking infrastructure, Transport Pol., 100, pp. 187-202, (2021); Allison P.D., Logistic Regression Using SAS: Theory and Application, (2012); Ao Y., Zhang Y., Wang Y., Chen Y., Yang L., Influences of rural built environment on travel mode choice of rural residents: the case of rural Sichuan, J.

Based on statistics, interview data, and policy documents, this study analyses the provision and utilisation of community care facilities in Beijing by conducting spatial and qualitative analysis based on structuration theory. The mapping and spatial analysis reveal spatial inequity in the allocation of community care facilities in Beijing, which increased from 494 in 2017 to 1,201 in 2020. Communities in suburban areas, where the older population is growing the fastest, have poorer spatial accessibility to community care services than those located in the central city. Qualitative analysis based on interviews with 28 older residents in six communities, and six managers and staff members of community care facilities, revealed high demands for community care services including daily life support, emotional support, and healthcare services, with low utilisation of the services and many challenges for service provision. Poor perception and evaluation of the services by older persons result in low utilisation of the services. Financial difficulties in service provision and limited support from the government are the major challenges reported by the managers. Strategies have also been developed to meet these challenges by the older persons and managers. Text analysis of policy documents shows the development of regulations and policies on the construction, support, and quality management of the community care system. The complex dynamics of interaction between structure and agency in resource allocation and daily practice of service delivery shapes the provision and utilisation of community care services as a relatively new mode for aged care in China. The findings support understanding the challenges of community care service provision and utilisation from a health geography perspective. Joint efforts from local governments, communities, the private sector, and older residents are needed to support ageing in place in Beijing. © 2023 The Authors.","ageing in place; Beijing; community care services; provision and utilisation; structuration theory","","","","","","Lingnan University, LU, (DR182B); Lingnan University, LU","We received support from Lingnan University and have no financial conflicts of interest to report [Grant number DR182B].","Chen X., John G.I.L.E.S., Yao Y.A.O., Winnie Y.I.P., Qinqin M.E.N.G., Lisa B.E.R.K.M.A.N., He C.H.E.N., Et al., The Path to Healthy Ageing in China: A Peking University-Lancet Commission, The Lancet, 400, pp. 1967-2006, (2022); Dong K., Zhenzhen W.A.N.G., Zhang D., China’s Population Ageing and the Construction of the Old-Age System, 1, pp. 53-64, (2020); Fang E.F., Morten S.-K., Heiko J.A.H.N., Juan L.I., Li L.I.N.G., Hongwei G.U.O., Xinqiang Z.H.U., Et al., A Research Agenda for Ageing in China in the 21st Century, Ageing Research Reviews, 24, pp. 197-205, (2015); Giddens A., The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration, (1984); Golant S.M., Residential Normalcy and the Ageing in Place Behaviours of Older Americans, 34, 12, pp. 1535-1557, (2015); Gu L., Mark W.R.O.S.E.N.B.E.R.G., Juxin Z.E.N.G., Changing Caregiving Relationships for Older Home-based Chinese People in a Transitional Stage: Trends, Factors, and Policy Implications, Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics, 70, pp. 219-229, (2017); Harman D., The Ageing Process, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 78, 11, pp. 7124-7128, (1981); He H., Chenyu Y.A.N., Impact of Living Styles and children’s Support on the Demand for Primary Health Services of the Elderly under the Willingness of Community Home Care, 14, 3, pp. 64-72, (2021); Li Y., Jie Y.U., Xiaolu G.A.O., Mark W.R.O.S.E.N.B.E.R.G., What Does Community-embedded Care Mean to Ageing-inplace in China?

The results show that the population is more aged and aging more rapidly in rural areas than in urban areas. Spatial clusters of population aging expanded from the east coastal region in 2000, to inland provinces such as Sichuan and Chongqing in 2010.

This scoping review synthesized and characterized the current research to prompt a more critical examination of food insecurity and aging. Data extraction included reviewing and characterizing the empirical, methodological and conceptual contributions of each study, accessed from selected health sciences and social sciences databases. Thirty-eight studies were included from 2,041 titles. Different methods and operationalizations of FI and age were found to be used across studies. Thematic analysis revealed, with few exceptions, consistent tendencies towards the biomedicalization of the FI issue alongside aging. These findings reinforce the value of population-level monitoring of FI and uptake of standard measures. Moving forward, the issue of FI and aging is an opportune topic for critical social analysis.  © Canadian Association on Gerontology 2020.","aging; aging; food insecurity; scoping study","Aging; Food Insecurity; Humans; Research Design; aging; article; data extraction; food insecurity; human; sociology; thematic analysis; methodology","","","","","Canada Research Chairs","Mark Rosenberg is the Tier I Canada Research Chair in Development Studies.

Promoting an understanding of both group experience and a broader conceptualization of age-friendly development, we argue that the notion and implications of a spatial ethnic enclave are replaced in the Saskatoon context by a social enclave. This network of social support is evident in Chinese-Canadian older adults' access to housing, recreation, transportation, and health services. The article concludes with lessons learned that would help enhance culturally pluralistic age-friendly development. This work underlines the significance of social capital development within more marginalized older-adult communities, both as a reaction to outside discrimination, and as a means of ensuring healthy and inclusive community aging. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

We employed longitudinal data analysis to examine the association between social frailty, socioeconomic status and depression using data from the WHO-SAGE survey. Our descriptive and cross-tabulation analyses show that the prevalence of depression and social frailty among older adults decreased considerably in 2014/2015 compared to 2007/2008. The finding also reveals a huge reduction in social frailty among older adults in northern Ghana–the most deprived regions in Ghana–compared to those in southern Ghana. The multivariate panel data analysis reveals that depression was significantly associated with social isolation, financial needs, and physical needs. The findings suggest an over time decline in social frailty and depression among older adults, as well as, reduction in regional differences in social frailty and depression among older adults in Ghana. © The Author(s) 2020.","financial needs; food security; Ghana; longitudinal analysis; physical needs; social isolation","Aged; Depression; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Ghana; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; World Health Organization; aged; depression; frail elderly; frailty; Ghana; human; questionnaire; World Health Organization","","","","","BERTHA; Danish Big Data Centre for Environment and Health; Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research; Novo Nordisk Foundation Challenge Programme, (NNF17OC0027864); World Health Organization, WHO","Funding text 1: We are grateful for helpful comments from the editor and anonymous reviewers.

A food security index composed of three indicators (food intake, food quality and food affordability) was developed to measure the food security status of community-living elderly people. Food security was then examined among community-living elderly in the central urban districts of Beijing, China. Data were collected by a questionnaire survey in the summer of 2013 and the response rate was 78.5%. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were applied to analyse food security and the associations between food security and demographic and socioeconomic factors. The results showed that 54.2% of the surveyed elderly experienced food security. Participants with better education (OR = 1.68) and better health (OR = 1.47) were more likely to experience food security. The young-old were less likely to experience food security than the older old (OR = 0.94). Elderly people who lived with their children were less likely to experience food security than those who lived alone (OR = 0.43). The results of impact factors on food security highlight both similarities with studies from more developed countries and the unique challenges faced in a rapidly changing China with its unique social, cultural and political systems. The food security index we developed in this study is a simple and effective measure of food security status, which can be used in surveys for evaluating the food security status of elderly people in the future. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Beijing; community-living elderly people; food programmes; food security","Aged; Beijing; China; Food Supply; Humans; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; aged; catering service; China; human; quality of life; questionnaire","","","","","Beijing Normal University, BNU","The authors acknowledge the research assistants for data collection from the Class of 2011 in the School of Geography, Beijing Normal University.

The chapter is divided into four parts. In the first part, Setting the Stage, the argument as to why models and systems thinking came to dominate the Quantitative Revolution is explained. What follows in the next part is a recounting of some of the best known and arguably most important examples of how modelling and systems thinking developed in human geography. The third part examines how the limitations of models and systems thinking evoked reactions that were both philosophic and methodological rejections of what the Quantitative Revolution had become. The other sub-theme that is highlighted is how changes in technology (e.g., the shift from mainframe computing to personal computing), also weakened the importance of statistical and mathematical modelling in favour of geographical information systems. In the conclusion, it is argued that the Quantitative Revolution was the starting point for a series of methodological shifts in human geography that were tied to philosophic and technological shifts that are likely to continue to shape human geography in new ways in the future. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Sarah A.

This study aims to understand how Chinese rural-urban migration in older age is influenced by, and impacts on the migrants’ mobilities. This study draws on a new conceptual framework of mobile vulnerability, influenced by physical, economic, institutional, social and cultural mobility, to understand older people’ experiences of migration from rural to urban areas. Forty-five structured in-depth interviews with older rural-urban migrants aged 55 and over were undertaken in four study sites in Beijing, using the constant comparative method. Results demonstrate that rural household registration (hukou) is an important factor that restricts rural older migrants’ institutional mobility. As older migrants’ physical mobility declines, their mobile vulnerability increases. Economic mobility is the key factor that influences their intention to stay in Beijing. Older migrants also described coping strategies to improve their socio-cultural mobility post-migration. These findings will inform service planning for older rural-urban migrants aimed at maintaining their health and wellbeing. © 2019 by the authors.

Four main levels were identified in these cases: (1) direct demands for changes in health care, (2) social issues, (3) spatial organization and (4) redefining the tasks of public authority in the face of identified challenges. The basic working method used in the study assumed a critical analysis of the literature on the subject. The time scope of the search covered articles from January 2020 to the end of August 2021 (thus covering the period of three pandemic waves). Combinations of keywords in the titles were used to search for articles. The health perspective pointed to the need for urban policies to develop a balance between health and economic costs and for coordination between different professionals/areas. A prerequisite for such a balance in cities is the carrying out of social and spatial analyses. These should illustrate the diversity of the social situations in individual cities (and more broadly in urban areas, including, sometimes, large suburbs) and the diversity’s relationship (both in terms of causes and consequences) to the severity of pandemics and other health threats. © 2022 by the authors.

The similarities stem from a shared belief in a western, biomedical model of health and healthcare. The three countries also share many of the same health problems that drive how healthcare is delivered in urban places. The differences, however, stem first and foremost from the political and economic differences that characterize the three countries and how these differences structure the consumption and geographies of healthcare. A second set of differences stem mainly from those parts of the population who are the most vulnerable to diseases, injury and violence and who are therefore most likely to show up in the respective healthcare systems. The analysis of the three countries and their urban populations shows that, while much has improved in health and healthcare in the cities of North America, what also remains true is that the overall improvements mask growing health inequities associated with differences in socio-economic status, race and where people live. Only through processes that engage the people living in their neighborhoods will the growing inequities in urban health in North American cities be reduced. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","Andrews G.J., Hall E., Evans B., Colls R., Moving beyond walkability: On the potential of health geography, Social Science and Medicine, 75, pp. 1925-1932, (2012); Asanin J., Wilson K., “I spent nine years looking for a doctor�?: Exploring access to health care among immigrants in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, Social Science and Medicine, 66, pp. 1271-1283, (2008); Beaulac J., Kristjansson E., Cummins S., A systematic review of food deserts, 1966-2007, Preventing Chronic Disease, 6, (2009); Bell S., Wilson K., Bissonnette L., Shah T., Access to primary health care: Does neighbourhood of residence really matter?, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 103, pp. 85-105, (2013); Berenzon Gorn S., Saavedra Solano N., Medina-Mora Icaza M.E., Aparicio Basauri V., Galvan Reyes J., Evaluación del sistema de salud mental en México: Hacia dónde encaminar la atención?

Four databases were searched in June 2021. Studies were eligible for inclusion if published within the last 20 years, peer-reviewed, examined apparently healthy older adults, and anal-ysed ≥2 movement behaviours together. QOL was represented by the World Health Organization Quality of Life measure which conceptualizes QOL by distinct domains. Study results were categorized and presented by domain. Risk of bias was completed for all included studies using methods described in the Cochrane Handbook. Thirty-one studies with 307 292 participants were included that examined QOL outcomes across seven domains: superdomain (composite measures), perceived physical health, mental and psychological states, level of independence, social relationships, environment, and general health. Findings in-dicated that moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was favourably associated with QOL. Time re-allocation studies that showed moving time into physical activity from sedentary behaviour were associated with favourable QOL changes. The evidence regarding sedentary behaviour and sleep duration was inconsistent. The quality of evidence was very low for all do-mains. In conclusion, there is consistent evidence that physical activity improves QOL in adults ≥65 years of age.

A noticeable disparity in the accessibility to existing residential care facilities, however, is demonstrated in existing studies. The spatial optimization of residential care facility (RCF) locations is urgently needed to promote equal access to residential care resources among the elderly population.Methods: A two-step floating catchment area method with an additional distance-decay function is adopted to measure accessibility to residential care facilities. The spatial optimization model is developed to maximize equity in accessibility by minimizing the total square difference between the accessibility score of each demand location and the weighted average accessibility score. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is implemented for the solution.Results: The optimized RCF layouts improve equal spatial access to residential care resources with very low accessibility standard variation (0.0066). A relatively large number of beds (51% of the total beds) to be located in the suburban districts between the central and periphery districts of Beijing are optimized. A smaller number of beds to be located in the central and periphery districts (33% and 16% respectively) are optimized. The gaps between the existing and optimized layouts suggest that more RCF beds (5961 beds) are needed in suburban districts, while the RCF beds in some subdistricts located in the central and periphery districts are oversupplied (5253 and 1584 surplus beds respectively).Conclusions: The optimized results correspond to the municipal special plan proposed by the Beijing government. The optimization objective of this study is different from traditional facility location optimization models, and the method is efficient in maximizing equal access to residential care facilities. This method can support knowledge-based policy-making and planning of residential care facilities. © 2014 Tao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Accessibility; Equity; PSO algorithm; Quadratic programming; Residential care facilities; Spatial optimization","Aged; China; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Population Surveillance; Residential Facilities; Beijing [China]; China; accessibility; algorithm; elderly care; equity; health care; optimization; residential location; spatial analysis; aged; China; ethnology; health care delivery; health care disparity; health survey; human; procedures; residential home; standards","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (41301164); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (985)","All the authors gratefully thank the reviewers and editor for their insightful and constructive comments.

There has been relatively little research, however, on the experiences and desires of people with dementia themselves as they negotiate informal and formal support in rural and small town settings. In this article, we draw on semi-structured interviews with 46 community-dwelling people with dementia and 43 partners in care in rural Ontario, Canada to examine how people with dementia relate to and within their communities as well as their perceptions of community support services. We identify the continued contributions of people with dementia to their own care and the care of others as well as common social, cultural, and organizational factors related to delayed service use and refusal to use particular services. We argue that care is “not there yet” for people in the earlier stages of dementia and that more attention needs to be paid to what people with dementia can offer their communities as well as the role of culture and gender in developing support. Our findings make an important contribution to understanding the experience of dementia in rural and small town Canada, which is relevant to rural healthcare and community support in other industrialized countries. © 2016","Dementia; Gender; Place; Rural; Support","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Community Networks; Dementia; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Perception; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Self-Help Groups; Social Support; Spouses; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; gender; health care; mental health; rural area; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; community care; community living; cultural factor; dementia; family; female; friend; gender; health care utilization; human; male; Ontario; patient attitude; rural area; rural health care; semi structured interview; social aspect; community care; complication; dementia; middle aged; perception; psychology; qualitative research; rural population; self help; social support; spouse; standards; statistics and numerical data; trends; very elderly","","","","","","","Alzheimer Society of B.C, Reactive Behaviours, (2011); Andrews G.J., Evans J., Wiles J.L., Re-spacing and re-placing gerontology: relationality and affect, Ageing Soc., 33, 8, pp. 1339-1373, (2013); Baxter J., Case studies in qualitative research, Qualitative Research Methods in Human Geography, pp. 130-146, (2016); Bartlett R., Scanning the conceptual horizons of citizenship, Dementia, 15, 3, pp. 453-461, (2016); Black B.S., Johnston D., Rabins P.V., Morrison A., Lyketsos C., Samus Q.M., Unmet needs of community-residing persons with dementia and their informal caregivers: findings from the maximizing independence at home study, J.

However, there is a lack of a theoretical model that illustrates the general patterns of rural evolution and transformation in these areas during structural transformation and outlines their future trajectories. Through case studies of a well-known grain base in China, this paper explores this issue using an analytical framework consisting of the trajectory of agricultural transformation associated with rural residents' livelihood changes and the trajectory of rural community restructuring induced by these livelihood changes. The results show that, since structural transformation, the grain-dependent countryside of China has roughly undergone an evolution from a stage of relative isolation and self-sufficiency, marked by agricultural involution, to a stage of accelerating factor flows between cities and the countryside, marked by part-time livelihoods, and finally to the current stage of accumulating “potential energies” for rural restructuring, marked by population aging. Meanwhile, challenges to the further transformation of the countryside are rooted in the socioeconomic characteristics of the middle-income period, which underscores the significance of overcoming the middle-income trap. Finally, we propose theoretical patterns for the future trajectories of China's grain-dependent countryside through the scenario analysis based on overcoming the middle-income trap and discuss the implications for rural revitalization in these areas. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Food security; Middle-income trap; Newly industrializing countries; Rural livelihoods; Rural restructuring; Structural transformation","China; agricultural development; analytical framework; food security; future prospect; livelihood; rural development","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42071223, 42471223); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Northeast Normal University, NENU, (2022zc002); Northeast Normal University, NENU; Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2020F009); Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 42071223, 42471223], the Major Cultivation Project of Medium-long Term Research in Philosophy and Social Sciences of Northeast Normal University [grant number 2022zc002], and Social Science Foundation Project of Shaanxi Province [grant number 2020F009].","Akram-Lodhi A.H., Kay C., Surveying the agrarian question (part 2): current debates and beyond, J.

Using descriptive statistics and binary regression analysis, we investigate the factors underlying rural residents' decision making to seek non-agricultural work, their work time, and work location based on data collected in Weifang, a city in the Shandong Province of China. The results show that economic factors play a pivotal role in rural residents' decision making to seek non-agricultural employment, full-time non-agricultural employment, or employment outside of their home county. Non-economic factors such as age, gender, social ties, education, access to arable land, geographical location, neighborhood effects, and self-perception are also significant factors in the decision-making process. The findings of this study shed light on future research regarding the impact of urbanization on rural residents.

However, informal caregivers encounter economic, physical, social, financial and psychological challenges when caring for older adults. The caregiving literature has shown variations in caregiving intensity and motivation between rural and urban informal caregivers of older adults. This situation is likely to result in rural-urban disparities in caregiver burden. However, the literature on predictors of caregiver burden is more focused on demographic, socio-economic, caregiving and health-related factors with very little attention to geographical dynamics. For this reason, the effects of demographic, socio-economic, caregiving, and health-related factors on the variations in caregiver burden between rural and urban informal caregivers of older adults are yet to be known in the sub-Saharan African context, including Ghana. Notably, the impact of geographical location on caregiver burden is mainly missing in the informal caregiving literature in Ghana. Situated within the stress process model, we determine the association between geographical location and caregiver burden among informal caregivers of older adults in Ghana. Methods: This study employed data from a large cross-sectional survey on informal caregiving, health, and healthcare among caregivers of older adults aged 50 years or above (N = 1,853) in Ghana. We selected the World Health Organization Impact of Caregiving Scale to measure caregiver burden. Generalized multivariable linear regression models were employed to determine the association between geographical location and caregiver burden among informal caregivers of older adults. We reported beta values and standard errors with significance levels of 0.05 or less. Results: The results showed that rural informal caregivers of older adults significantly have a decreased caregiver burden compared to urban informal caregivers (β = -1.64; SE = 0.41). Also, participants across all the self-rated health categories (poor/very poor: β = 12.63; SE = 1.65; fair: β = 9.56; SE = 1.07; good: β = 11.00; SE = 0.61, very good: β = 7.03; SE = 0.49) have a significantly increased caregiver burden for the full sample and for both rural (poor/very poor: β = 13.88; SE = 2.4; fair: β = 6.11; SE = 1.62; good: β = 9.97; SE = 0.96, very good: β = 6.06; SE = 0.71) and urban (poor/very poor: β = 11.86; SE = 2.25; fair: β = 12.33; SE = 1.42; good: β = 11.80; SE = 0.79, very good: β = 7.90; SE = 0.67) participants. This study further revealed that participants with no financial support needs reported a decreased caregiver burden compared to those with financial support needs for the full sample (β = -2.92, p-value < 0.01) and for both rural (β = -3.20; p-value < 0.01) and urban (β =-2.70; p-value < 0.01) participants. Conclusion: The findings from this study underscore geographical location differences in caregiver burden among informal caregivers of older adults in Ghana. Given these findings, the need to consider geographical location variations in providing welfare and health support programs to lessen caregiver burden among informal caregivers of older adults is welcomed. In line with the stress process model, such welfare and health programs should consider background, context, and stressor factors that contribute to variations in caregiver burden between rural and urban informal caregivers of older adults in Ghana and other sub-Saharan African countries. © The Author(s) 2024.","Caregiver burden; Geographical location; Ghana; Informal caregivers; Older persons","Aged; Caregiver Burden; Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Ghana; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population; adolescent; adult; aged; article; caregiver; caregiver burden; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; Ghana; health care survey; health program; human; informal care; informal caregiver; male; motivation; World Health Organization; economics; Ghana; health status; middle aged; psychology; rural population; socioeconomics; urban population","","","","","","","Kyei-Arthur F., Atobrah D., Exploring the motivations of family caregivers caring for older persons in urban poor Accra, Ghana, J Gerontol Soc Work, 65, 7, pp. 749-765, (2022); Dovie D.A., The status of older adult care in contemporary Ghana: a profile of some emerging issues, Front Sociol, 4, pp. 1-12, (2019); Diameta E., Adandom I., Jumbo S.U., Nwankwo H.C., Obi P.C., Kalu M.E., The burden experience of formal and informal caregivers of older adults with hip fracture in Nigeria, SAGE Open Nurs, 4, pp. 1-10, (2018); Faronbi J.O., Correlate of burden and coping ability of caregivers of older adults with chronic illness in Nigeria, Scand J Caring Sci, 32, 4, pp. 1288-1296, (2018); Sanuade O.A., Boatemaa S., Caregiver profiles and determinants of caregiving burden in Ghana, Public Health, 129, 7, pp. 941-947, (2015); Gillespie R., Mullan J., Harrison L., Managing medications: the role of informal caregivers of older adults and people living with dementia.

Paralleling the growing theoretical pluralism within health geography has been a growing methodological pluralism. As in other parts of human geography, health geographers have embraced historical research, quantitative and qualitative methods, and computer mapping and geographic information science (GIS). Analysing recent contributions by health geographers, the question I seek to answer is whether the growing theoretical and methodological pluralism has paradoxically led to increasing divisions in the topics of study based mainly, but not solely, on what methods are employed in the research. While there are topical overlaps (e.g. quantitative and qualitative studies of particular vulnerable groups), it is less obvious as to how research using one methodology is informing research using the other methodology. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","health geography; methods; qualitative; quantitative; topics of study","GIS; health geography; mapping; methodology; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis","","","","","","","Andrews G.J., Chen S., Myers S., The ‘taking place’ of health and wellbeing: Towards non-representational theory, Social Science & Medicine, 108, pp. 210-222, (2014); Andrews G.J., Evans J., McAlister S., ‘Creating the right therapy vibe’: Relational performances in holistic medicine, Social Science & Medicine, 83, pp. 99-109, (2013); Andrews G.J., Hall E., Evans B., Colls R., Moving beyond walkability: On the potential of health geography, Social Science & Medicine, 75, pp. 1925-1932, (2012); Astell-Burt T., Feng X., Croteau K., Kolt G.S., Influence of neighbourhood ethnic density, diet and physical activity on ethnic differences in weight status: A study of 214,807 adults in Australia, Social Science & Medicine, 93, pp. 70-77, (2013); Bell S., Wilson K., Bissonnette L., Shah T., Access to primary health care: Does neighborhood of residence matter?, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 103, pp. 85-105, (2013); Big-Canoe K., Richmond C.A.M., Anishinabe youth perceptions about community health: Toward environmental repossession, Health & Place, 26, pp. 127-135, (2014); Breyer B., Voss-Andreae A., Food mirages: Geographic and economic barriers to healthful food access in Portland, Oregon, Health & Place, 24, pp. 131-139, (2013); Campbell M., Ballas D., Dorling D., Mitchell R., Mortality inequalities: Scotland versus England and Wales, Health & Place, 23, pp. 179-186, (2014); Campbell R., Longhurst R., Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD): Gendered metaphors, blogs and online forums, The New Zealand Geographer, 69, pp. 83-93, (2013); Carmalt J.C., Faubion T., Normative approaches to critical health geography, Progress in Human Geography, 34, 3, pp. 292-308, (2010); Coombes E., van Sluijs E., Jones A., Is environmental setting associated with the intensity and duration of children’s physical activity?

In this study we examined (a) gender-based predictors of unmet health-care need among seniors and (b) whether access was influenced by wealth status (measured by income quintiles). Gender-specific negative log-log regression models were fitted to data from the Study on Global Ageing and Health to examine associations between unmet health-care need and health insurance status controlling for theoretically relevant covariates. Insurance status was an important determinant of men and women's unmet health-care need but the relationship was moderated by income quintile for women and not men. While occupation was important for men, religion, marital status and income quintile were significantly associated with women's unmet health-care need. Based on the observed gender differences, we recommend the implementation of programmes aimed at improving the economic situation of older people, particularly women. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

However, knowledge is limited about how wait times affect patients' lives. We utilized the 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey to examine the experience of patients requiring a consultation with a medical specialist for a new condition. Multivariate logistic regression predicted the likelihood that a respondent self-reported his or her life was affected. Subsequent cross-tabulations determined the ways in which life was affected. Females, middle-aged respondents, new immigrants and those with low income and poor health status were more likely to report their life was affected. Worry, stress and anxiety were the most frequently reported impacts, followed by pain, stress on family/friends, deterioration of health and loss of work. Our research demonstrates a need to address the impacts of wait times on health and well-being, with a focus on particular subpopulation groups.","","Adult; Anxiety; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Medicine; Middle Aged; Ontario; Referral and Consultation; Stress, Psychological; Waiting Lists; non prescription drug; adult; anxiety; article; Canada; cohort analysis; consultation; daily life activity; deterioration; disease predisposition; educational status; family; female; friend; health status; human; immigrant; income; lowest income group; major clinical study; male; medical specialist; middle aged; patient worry; quality of life; stress; unemployment; epidemiology; etiology; health care delivery; health care survey; hospital admission; medicine; mental stress; patient referral; statistics and numerical data","","","","","","","Aday L.A., Andersen R., A Framework for the Study of Access to Medical Care, Health Services Research, 9, pp. 208-220, (1974); Asanin J., Wilson K., I spent nine years looking for a doctor': Exploring access to health care among immigrants in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, Social Science and Medicine, 66, 6, pp. 1271-1283, (2008); Barua B., Esmail N., Waiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada, (2012); Bichel A., Erfle S., Wiebe V., Axelrod D., Conly J., Improving Patient Access to Medical Services: Preventing the Patient from Being Lost in Translation, Healthcare Quarterly, 13, SPEC.

This paper applies multilevel analysis to the 2013 China General Social Survey data on social development and health to understand this twofold phenomenon. Multilevel models are developed to investigate the impact of socioeconomic development and environmental degradation on self-reported health (SRH) and self-reported happiness (SRHP), differentiating among lower, middle, and higher income groups. The results of the logit multilevel analysis demonstrate that income, jobs, and education increased the likelihood of rating SRH and SRHP positively for the lower and middle groups but had little or no effect on the higher income group. Having basic health insurance had an insignificant effect on health but increased the likelihood of happiness among the lower income group. Provincial-level pollutants were associated with a higher likelihood of good health for all income groups, and community-level industrial pollutants increased the likelihood of good health for the lower and middle income groups. Measures of community-level pollution were robust predictors of the likelihood of unhappiness among the lower and middle income groups. Environmental hazards had a mediating effect on the relationship between socioeconomic development and health, and socioeconomic development strengthened the association between environmental hazards and happiness. These outcomes indicate that the complex interconnections among socioeconomic development and environmental degradation have differential effects on well-being among different income groups in China. © The Author(s) 2016.","environmental justice; happiness; health; multilevel analysis; pollution; socioeconomic development","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; China; Economic Development; Environment; Exercise; Female; Happiness; Health Status; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Income; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Multilevel Analysis; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult; China; environmental degradation; environmental justice; health insurance; low income population; pollution; public health; socioeconomic conditions; China; degradation; education; happiness; health insurance; human; human experiment; justice; middle income group; multilevel analysis; pollutant; social evolution; unhappiness; wellbeing; adolescent; adult; aged; China; economic development; environment; exercise; female; health disparity; health status; human relation; income; male; middle aged; multilevel analysis; social support; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult","","","","","China National Science Foundation; China Natural Science Foundation Program, (41371183, 41501145); China Social Science Foundation; Canada Research Chairs; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE","Funding text 1: The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was partially supported by funding from the Canada Research Chairs Program and the China Natural Science Foundation Program (No. 41371183 and No. 41501145).; Funding text 2: Juxin Zeng is a professor of human geography in the Department of Urban and Environmental Sciences at Central China Normal University in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

Understanding the spatial distribution of the health status of older people has attracted more and more attention in many countries, including China. By employing descriptive analysis, this study uses data from the Chinese Population Censusand Statistical Year Bookto explore the health inequalities of older people at the national level. Based on the Getis-Ord Gi*, this study finds that the uneven spatial distribution of socio-economic status results in health inequalities for older people at the national level. The geographic distribution of life expectancy was correlated with a number of important demographic, socio-economic, and environmental variables.

The root causes of food insecurity are closely linked to poverty, and social policies and income supplements, including public and private pensions, have been shown to sharply curb food insecurity into later life. However, social, economic, and political trends that are closely connected to social and health inequalities threaten to undermine the conditions that have limited food insecurity among older people until now. Exploring the prevalence and predictors of food insecurity among older people across Canada has important implications for domestic policies concerning health, healthcare, and social welfare. Methods: Data come from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2012 Annual Component (n = 14,890). Descriptive statistics and a generalized linear model approach were used to determine prevalence and estimate the associations between food insecurity—as measured by the Household Food Security Survey Module—and social, demographic, geographic, and economic factors. Results: Approximately 2.4% of older Canadians are estimated to be moderately or severely food insecure. Income was by far the strongest predictor of food insecurity (total household income <$20,000 compared to >$60,000, OR: 46.146, 95% CI: 12.523–170.041, p < 0.001). Younger older people, and those with a non-white racial background also had significantly greater odds of food insecurity (ages 75+ compared to 65–74, OR: 0.322, 95% CI: 0.212–0.419, p < 0.001; and OR: 2.429, 95% CI: 1.438–4.102, p < 0.001, respectively). Sex, home ownership, marital status, and living arrangement were all found to confound the relationship between household income and food insecurity. Prevalence of food insecurity varied between provinces and territories, and odds of food insecurity were approximately five times greater for older people living in northern Canada as compared to central Canada (OR: 5.189, 95% CI: 2.329–11.562, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Disaggregating overall prevalence of food insecurity among older people demonstrates how disparities exist among sub-groups of older people. The seemingly negligible existence of food insecurity among older people has obscured the importance, practicality, and timeliness of including this age group in research on food insecurity. The current research underscores the critical importance of an income floor in preventing food insecurity among older people, and contributes a Canadian profile of the prevalence and predictors of food insecurity among older people to the broader international literature. © 2018, MDPI AG.

Combining the material and psychosocial explanations of health, this study explores the potential interactions between social and economic capital in influencing older adults’ health in urban and rural China. Methods: Using data from the China Family Panel Survey, physical and mental health in 2018 were regressed on social and economic capital indicators in 2016, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics of 3535 respondents aged 65 and older. Rothman’s synergy index was calculated to investigate potential interaction effects. Results: Economic hardships were significantly related to both self-reported health and mental health. Neighborhood cohesion and social participation were significantly associated with mental health for all, bonding trust was significantly associated with mental health for urban older people. We found no significant associations between social capital components and self-reported health. There was an interaction effect between low neighborhood cohesion and economic hardships, and between low social participation and economic hardships, creating an increased burden of poor mental health. The interaction effect between low bonding trust and economic hardships on mental health was apparent only among urban older people. Conclusions: Geographical settings are important factors in the complexity between social and economic capital in affecting older health. Intervention efforts directed towards reducing simultaneously multiple dimensions of deprivation, such as poverty, social exclusion, social isolation, could be helpful in improving older people’s health. In materially deprived places, policies to promote health equity by improving social capital but without eliminating poverty may be less effective. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cohesion, trust, and participation; Material and psychosocial mechanisms; Older people; Physical and mental health; Urban and rural","Aged; China; Diagnostic Self Evaluation; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Poverty; Social Capital; China; adult; age structure; economic conditions; mental health; public health; social capital; social participation; spatiotemporal analysis; urban population; aged; article; China; demography; female; health equity; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mental health; neighborhood; poverty; social capital; social exclusion; social isolation; social participation; trust; China; poverty; psychology; self evaluation","","","","","Science and Technology Project of Beautiful China Ecological Civilization Construction, (XDA23100403); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Postdoctoral Research Foundation of China, (2018M640171); Young Scientists Fund, (41901179); Lingnan University, LU, (DR182B)","The research was supported by funding from: the Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (41901179), the Science and Technology Project of Beautiful China Ecological Civilization Construction (XDA23100403), the Direct Grant scheme of Lingnan University, Hong Kong (DR182B) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M640171).

It focuses on women because of their gendered role in providing care and the specific challenges they share in negotiating care. The chapter draws on intersectionality to explore the diversity within these experiences, with attention to the complex social construction of women's identities and place within the Canadian context. It chooses six variables to frame our discussion: education, labor force participation, income, immigration, marital status, and living arrangements. Disputes about the existence of a healthy immigrant effect increasingly have explored the intersectionality and social determinants of immigrant health, in order to shed light on its complex time path. Understanding normative pressures around care and the diversity of older women's experiences of health and health care requires us to engage with ongoing discussions about the differences between, and meanings of, sex and gender. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Melissa D.

Yet, little is known about how such a transition has manifested as a new phenomenon in a non-western country, within a variegated geo-historical context. Using a relational approach, this paper examines what it means to embed care services in a community for supporting aging-in-place through a new model, community-based care centre (CBCC) in Beijing, China. Interview data were obtained from 47 participants (including administrative staff, service providers, and older people) to understand how stakeholders envision the transition towards the CBCC model. Our findings show that embedding CBCCs into communities is a three-dimensional process: 1) the dynamics of locating services and socio-relational distance in shaping a sense of place; 2) the blurring of formal and informal care relations in creating care spaces; and 3) the interweaving of collectivism and individualism in a transition from “work-unit” to community. These interactions indicate that community-embedded care is geographically, socially, politically, and culturally constructed and needs to be understood as dynamic and relational. Our findings suggest that the theoretical underpinnings of aging-in-place need to broaden to include non-western perspectives. © 2021 Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association canadienne des géographes.","a relational approach; aging-in-place; China; community-embedded care; place and space","Beijing [China]; China; aging population; elderly population; health services; local participation; model","","","","","Lorraine Hutton; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41871171); Queen's University; China Scholarship Council, CSC","The research is supported by the Geographies of Aging Projects Lab at Queen's University, the China Scholarship Council, and the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41871171).

However, little is known about the food access experiences of older adults in Ghana. This paper explores if there are barriers to accessing food and if there are, what strategies have been adopted to negotiate these barriers. Through purposive sampling, a total of 123 older adults were recruited in Ghana to participate in sharing circles (n = 10) and semi-structured interviews (n = 42). Data analyses were done in NVivo using a thematic analytical approach. Functional impairment and poor health, poverty, inadequate social support, lack of control over household resources, policy neglect, low crop yields, and sociocultural values were found to hinder older people's access to food. They navigate these barriers by rationing meals, engaging in income-earning activities, seeking support from social networks, and begging. Our findings contribute to discourses on food security and highlight the need for a multilevel, comprehensive approach that targets both the individual and the broader human environment in addressing the food needs of older people. © 2021 Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association canadienne des géographes","coping strategies; food access barriers; food insecurity; Ghana; older adults","Ghana; accessibility; adult; coping strategy; food security; food supply; sustainable development","","","","","","","Aboderin A., Decline in material family support for older people in urban Ghana, Africa: Understanding processes and causes of change, Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 59B, 3, pp. S128-S137, (2004); Agyemang-Duah W., Peprah C., Peprah P., Barriers to formal healthcare utilisation among poor older people under the livelihood empowerment against poverty programme in the Atwima Nwabiagya District of Ghana, BMC Public Health, 19, 1, pp. 1-12, (2019); Akudugu M.A., Alhassan A., The climate change menace, food security, livelihoods and social safety in Northern Ghana, International Journal of Sustainable Development & World Policy, 1, 3, pp. 80-95, (2012); Angeles G., Chakrabarti A., Handa S., Spektor G., Darko R.O., Osei-Akoto I., de Groot R., Livelihood empowerment against poverty programme: Endline impact evaluation report, (2017); Atuoye K.N., Luginaah I., Food as a social determinant of mental health among household heads in the Upper West Region of Ghana, Social Science & Medicine, 180, pp. 170-180, (2017); Braimah J.A., Rosenberg M.W., ‘They do not care about us anymore’: Understanding the situation of older people in Ghana, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 2337, pp. 2-15, (2021); Bronfenbrenner U., Toward an experimental ecology of human development, American Psychologist, 32, 7, pp. 513-531, (1977); Coe C., Negotiating eldercare in Akuapem, Ghana: Care-scripts and the role of non-kin, Africa, 87, 1, pp. 137-154, (2017); Doh D., Afranie S., Aryeetey E.B., Expanding social protection opportunities for older people in Ghana: A case for strengthening traditional family systems and community institutions.

The purpose of this research was to analyze the epidemiological characteristics, temporal variation characteristics, and spatiotemporal clustering of HFMD cases at the town level from 2009 to 2019 to improve public health outcomes. Methods Mathematical statistics, a seasonal index, wavelet analysis, and spatiotemporal scans were used to analyze epidemiological characteristics, time series trends, and spatiotemporal clusters of HFMD in Hubei. Results EV-A71 (Enterovirus A71) and CVA16 (Coxsackievirus A16) constitute the two primary pathogens of the HFMD epidemic in Hubei, among which EV-A71 is the dominant pathogen, especially in 2016. In terms of age distribution, a major peak occurred at 0-5 years and a very small increase appeared at 25-35 years, with the former having a higher incidence among males than females and the latter having the opposite difference between males and females. The number/rate of HFMD cases exhibited a considerable increase followed by a moderate decline from 2009 to 2019, with the first large peak in April-July and a smaller peak in November-December. HFMD in Hubei exhibited the characteristics of a 270-day cycle with multiscale nesting, which was similar to the periodicity of HFMD cases caused by EV-A71 (9 months). Cities with a higher incidence of HFMD formed a part of an ""A-shaped urban skeleton"". Subdistricts had the highest incidence of HFMD, followed by towns and villages. The spatiotemporal scan results showed one most likely cluster and 22 secondary clusters, which was consistent with the geographic location of railways and rivers in Hubei. Conclusions These findings may be helpful in the prevention and control of HFMD transmission and in implementing effective measures in Hubei Province. © 2023 Wang et al.","","Child, Preschool; China;

In this quantitative study, our objectives were to (1): Describe bonding social capital within four distinct First Nations communities in Canada, and (2) Explore the associations between bonding social capital and self-rated health in these communities. With community permission, cross-sectional data were drawn from the Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds study. Four reserve-based First Nations communities were included in the analysis, totaling 591 participants. Descriptive statistics were computed to examine levels of social capital among communities and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify social capital predictors of good self-rated health. Age, sex, education level, and community were controlled for in all models. Across the four communities in this study, areas of common social capital included frequent socialization among friends and large and interconnected family networks. Positive self-rated health was associated with civic engagement at federal or provincial levels (OR=1.65, p<0.05) and organizational membership (OR=1.60, p<0.05), but overall, sociodemographic variables were more significantly associated with self-rated health than social capital variables. Significant differences in social capital were found across the four communities and community of residence was a significant health outcomes predictor in all logistic regression models. In conclusion, this study represents one of the first efforts to quantitatively study First Nations social capital with respect to health in Canada. The results reflect significant differences in the social capital landscape across different First Nations communities and suggest the need for social capital measurement tools that may be adapted to unique Indigenous contexts. Further, the impact of social capital on health may be better explored and interpreted with more community-specific instruments and with supplementary qualitative inquiry. © 2021","Canada; First nations; Indigenous health; Social capital; Social determinants of health; Social epidemiology","adult; article; Canada; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; educational status; female; First Nation; friend; heart; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; sexual education; social capital; social determinants of health; socialization","","","","","Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds study; Canadian Partnership Against Cancer; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, IRSC, (OFM-141086); Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, HSF, (PCS-144022)","The Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds study is supported by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada ( PCS-144022 ), the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research ( OFM-141086 ).

As perceived constructs, self-rated health (SRH) and general life satisfaction (LS) might be more strongly related to perceived weight status than actual weight status. The aim was to assess agreement between perceived weight status and self-reported body mass index (BMI), and to investigate their associations with SRH and LS as indicators of HRQL. Methods Cross-sectional data included 87,545 adults aged 18-65 years from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey. Agreement between perceived weight status and self-reported BMI was assessed. Prevalence of suboptimal SRH and LS was estimated by perceived weight status and BMI, and adjusted logistic regression used to assess the odds of suboptimal outcomes. Results Overall agreement between perceived weight status and self-reported BMI was only moderate (females: j = 0.58; males: j = 0.42). The lowest prevalences of suboptimal SRH and LSwere in thosewho reported both a healthy weight BMI and ""about right"" weight perception. Discordance between perceived weight status and BMI status, and congruence (i.e. perceived weight status = BMI) around underweight or overweight/ obese were associated with poorer SRH and LS. For weight perceptions of ""about right"", BMI status had minimal influence on suboptimal SRH or LS, while perceptions of underweight or overweightwere associatedwith higher odds of suboptimal SRH and LS, independent of BMI. Conclusions Adults' weight status perceptions often do not agree with their actual weight status, even when self-reported. While both perceived and actual weight status influence selfrated health and life satisfaction, perceptions are more strongly associated with theseHRQLindicators and should be considered when informing obesity-targeted policies and programmes. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Body mass index; Health status; Life satisfaction; Quality of life; Weight misperception","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Body Image; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Canada; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Personal Satisfaction; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Self Concept; Self Report; Thinness; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; article; body image; body mass; body weight; Canada; cross-sectional study; female; health status; health survey; human; male; middle aged; obesity; prevalence; psychological aspect; quality of life; satisfaction; self concept; self report; statistical model; young adult","","","","","Institute of Population and Public Health—Public Health Agency of Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR","Acknowledgments K.M.

This ensures access to medically necessary health care services for all Canadians regardless of ability to pay. Despite this important piece of legislation, research has shown persistent inequalities in access between and within socio-demographic groups, and geographic areas. To date, most research has focused on access to primary care, with much less attention paid to specialist care as an important component of the health care continuum. Thus, the objectives of this research are to address this gap in knowledge by examining the factors associated with difficulty accessing specialist services, and the reasons why particular subpopulation groups report experiencing difficulties. Methods. This research uses multivariate logistic regression to analyze data from the Canadian Community Health Surveys' optional content from the province of Ontario (n=21,526) related to accessing specialist health care services. The multivariate logistic regression model identifies several subpopulation groups that are more likely to report difficulty accessing specialist care when required. Cross-tabulations are subsequently used to establish the main reasons why difficulties are faced. Results: Over 26% of respondents required a specialist visit in the 12 months preceding administration of the survey. Of these, 22% reported difficulty accessing specialist care. Those with difficulties were more likely to be immigrants, post-secondary educated, and have one or more chronic conditions. People living in urban health regions were also more likely to report difficulties accessing care. Primarily wait times were cited as reasons for these difficulties, followed by a perceived lack of availability. Conclusions: There are difficulties faced by the general population as a whole (e.g., wait times) as well as particular difficulties experienced more frequently by certain groups (e.g., transportation, language, and cost barriers for newcomers). These issues are important, as they may discourage individuals from using necessary health care services, and may contribute to feelings of dissatisfaction with the health care system. © 2013 Harrington et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Access to health care; Difficulties; Specialist care","Adult; Educational Status; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Medicine; Middle Aged; Ontario; Waiting Lists; adult; Canada; educational status; epidemiology; female; health care delivery; health care survey; hospital admission; human; male; medicine; middle aged; migrant; organization and management; statistical model; statistics and numerical data","","","","","","","Of Commons H., Canada Health Act, (1984); Curtis L.J., MacMinn W.J., Health care utilization in Canada: Twenty-five years of evidence, Canadian Public Policy, 34, 1, pp. 65-87, (2008); Bichel A., Erfle S., Wiebe V., Axelrod D., Conly J., Improving patient access to medical services: Preventing the patient from being lost in translation, Healthc Q, 13, SPEC.

The viability of the nonprofit sector to take up this role, however, remains unclear. This paper explores the changing role of nonprofit organisations with respect to the provision of long-term care in Ontario, Canada, where extensive restructuring of public services occurred during the 1990s. Drawing on a critical review of legislation, government policies and documents, and stakeholder reports, the authors present a comparative study of two distinct long-term care reform models, featuring public and private provision, respectively, which were developed by ideologically opposed provincial governments. The results indicate that despite unanimous promotion of voluntarism (and the attendant ascendancy of the nonprofit sector) as a central feature of health care restructuring, the divergent reform models actually trap nonprofit organisations between direct incorporation within public provision on the one hand, and direct free-market competition on the other. The findings suggest that underscoring long-term care reform in Ontario, and elsewhere, is the co-option of the nonprofit sector, which resonates with concern for its ability to replace effectively the public provision of health care services. The results also point to the need to conceptualise the consequent actions taken by nonprofit organisations in order to inform current debates surrounding health care restructuring and voluntarism.","","Canada;

However, the health conditions of new immigrants deteriorate after a few years of their arrival in Canada. This phenomenon is popularly termed the ""healthy immigrant effect"" (HIE) in the immigrant health literature. Although different hypotheses have been proposed to understand HIE, the causes are subject to ongoing discussion. Unlike previous studies, this study explored the possible causes behind the variations in the health status of recent and more established immigrants comparing 2001 and 2010 Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS). Four different hypotheses - namely lifestyle change, barriers to health care services, poor social determinants of health, and work related stress - were tested to understand variations in health status. The study concludes that there is a statistically significant difference in the socioeconomic characteristics and health outcomes of immigrants having less than and more than 10 years of residency in Canada. Logistic regression models show that the health conditions of immigrants are associated with age, sex, ethnic origin, smoking habit, Body Mass Index (BMI), total household income, number of consultations made with a family doctor per year and work related stress. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Canada; Health; Healthy immigrant effect; Immigrants; Lifestyle; Social determinants of health","Canada; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigrants and Immigrants; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status Disparities; Health Surveys; Humans; Life Style; Logistic Models; Male; Social Determinants of Health; Stress, Psychological; Time Factors; Canada; body mass; health care; health services; health status; health survey; household income; immigrant; lifestyle; smoking; socioeconomic conditions; adult; age; aged; article; body mass; Canada; consultation; controlled study; ethnicity; female; gender; general practitioner; health disparity; health service; health status; health survey; human; immigrant; job stress; lifestyle; male; self report; smoking habit; social determinants of health; very elderly; cross-sectional study; employment; health care delivery; mental stress; migrant; migration; psychology; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; time","","","","","","","Abraido-Lanza A.F., Chao M.T., Florez K.R., Do healthy behaviors decline with greater acculturation?: implications for the Latino mortality paradox, Soc.

A critical examination of recent demographic trends reveals, however, that older cohorts of the Aboriginal population are increasing at a faster rate than younger cohorts, primarily due to improvements in life expectancy and declining fertility rates. Yet, there are surprisingly few health studies that have recognized the aging of the Aboriginal population. The overall goal of this paper is to examine differences in health status, use of conventional health care and traditional approaches to healing between older and younger cohorts of the Aboriginal population as well as to examine the importance of age as a determinant of health and health care use. Using data from the 2001 Statistics Canada Aboriginal Peoples Survey and contingency tables and logistic regression, the results demonstrate that older Aboriginal people face unique challenges - e.g. loss of traditional approaches to healing, geographic isolation, identity politics, constitutional and legal divisions within the Aboriginal community - with respect to their health and access to health services. These outcomes result from a colonial past and contemporary policies that affect all Aboriginal people. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Health care utilization; Health status; Off-reserve; Older Aboriginal people; Reserves; Traditional healing","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Canada; Cohort Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Health Status Disparities; Health Surveys; Humans; Indians, North American; Inuits; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Social Identification; Young Adult; Canada; aging population; health care; health services; health status; indigenous population; traditional medicine; Aborigine; adult; age; aged; article; Canada; cohort analysis; demography; female; geography; health care access; health care delivery; health care policy; health care utilization; health status; human; major clinical study; male; political system; population research; public health service; traditional medicine; adolescent; American Indian; Eskimo; health disparity; health survey; methodology; middle aged; social behavior; statistics; traditional medicine; utilization review","","","","","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR","Funding for this research project was provided by the Institute of Aboriginal Peoples Health of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the SEDAP-II (Social and Economic Dimensions of an Aging Population) Research Program .","Aldrich J.H., Nelson F.D., Linear probability, Logit, and Probit models, (1984); First Nations regional longitudinal health survey (RHS), (2009); History of residential schools, (2009); Buchignani N., Armstrong-Esther C., Informal care and older native Canadians, Ageing and Society, 19, 1, pp. 3-32, (1994); Royal commission on Aboriginal peoples, Looking forward, looking back, 1, (1996); Aboriginal peoples of Canada: A demographic profile, (2003); Aboriginal peoples survey 2001: Concepts and methods guide, (2003); Words first: An evolving terminology relating to Aboriginal peoples in Canada, (2004); Basic departmental data 2004, (2005); Projections of the Aboriginal populations, Canada, provinces and territories, 2001 to 2017, (2005); Aboriginal identity population by age groups, median age and sex, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories - 20% sample, (2008); Population by age groups, sex and Aboriginal identity groups, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories - 20% sample data, (2008); 2006 Census: Aboriginal peoples in Canada in 2006: Inuit, Métis and First Nations, 2006 census.

Little is known, however, about the well-being of elderly residents and the relationship between their health and living in residential care facilities (RCFs). Hence this research aims to understand the well-being of elderly residents in RCFs and how the environment of RCFs affects elderly people's everyday activities and health. The concepts of therapeutic landscapes, active aging, and well-being contribute to understanding the relationships among aging, health, and environment within RCF settings. Qualitative data from 46 in-depth semi-structured interviews with RCF managers, elderly residents, and family members in Beijing were transcribed and analysed using the constant comparative method. The results show that most of the elderly residents are satisfied with their lives in RCFs, but a few of them feel isolated and depressed after their relocation. Each RCF, as a place with its unique physical and social environment, has a significant influence on the elderly residents' physical and psychological well-being. Individual factors such as characteristics of elderly residents, their attitudes on aging and residential care, and family support also play important roles in their adaptation and well-being after relocation from home to RCFs. Although this study focuses on residential care at the local level, it sheds light on future research on geographical and socio-cultural meanings of elder care at local, regional, and national levels in China. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Aging; China; Residential care; Therapeutic landscapes; Well-being","Activities of Daily Living; Adaptation, Psychological; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; China; Environment Design; Facility Design and Construction; Family; Female; Health Status; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nursing Homes; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Social Environment; Beijing [China]; China; aging; elderly care; health care; quality of life; adaptive behavior; adult; aged; aging; article; attitude to aging; China; clinical article; daily life activity; depression; environmental factor; female; health care facility; health status; human; landscape; life satisfaction; male; psychological well being; qualitative analysis; residential care; semi structured interview; social environment; social isolation; social support; adaptive behavior; construction work and architectural phenomena; environmental planning; family; home for the aged; middle aged; nursing home; psychological aspect; qualitative research; quality of life","","","","","Beijing–Tianjin Megacity Area, (2007DFC20180); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST","All the authors gratefully thank the interviewees for participating in the research and Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology for financial support of this research through international collaborative research project “ Research on Environmental Change and Health Security in Beijing–Tianjin Megacity Area” (Grant Agreement No. 2007DFC20180 ).","Andrews G.J., Residential homes: from distributions in spaces to the elements of place, Ageing and place: Perspectives, policy, practice, pp. 61-78, (2005); Andrews G.J., Phillips D.R., Ageing and place: Perspectives, policy, practice, (2005); Bartlett H.P., Peel N., Healthy ageing in the community, Ageing and place, pp. 98-109, (2005); Bartlett H.P., Phillips D.R., Regulating residential aged care homes in Hong Kong: issues for the Asia-pacific region, Asian Journal of Public Administration, 17, 2, pp. 231-247, (1995); Social welfare facilities, (2009); Notice on accelerating the development of residential care facilities; The future 50 years of Beijing municipality, (2000); Bernard M., Bartlam B., Sim J., Biggs S., Housing and care for older people: life in an English purpose-built retirement village, Aging & Society, 27, pp. 555-578, (2007); Bowling A., The concept of successful and positive ageing, Family Practice, 10, 4, pp. 449-453, (1993); Calkins M.P., The physical and social environment of the person with Alzheimer's disease, Aging and Mental Health, 5, pp. 74-78, (2001); A city for all ages: Fact or fiction?, (2000); Chong A.M., Ng S., Woo J., Kwan A.Y., Positive ageing: the views of middle-aged and older adults in Hong Kong, Ageing & Society, 26, pp. 243-265, (2006); Clarke A., Warren L., Hopes, fears and expectations about the future: what do older people's stories tell us about active ageing?, Ageing & Society, 27, pp. 465-488, (2007); Report on elderly population information and development of elder care of Beijing in 2008.

Little is known about the way older people access residential care in the context of Beijing. In this research, qualitative data collected from 46 in-depth semi-structured interviews with residential care facility (RCF) managers, older residents, and their family members in six RCFs in Beijing were transcribed and analysed using the constant comparative method. The findings included the following themes: access to residential care as geographical access, information access, economic access, socio-cultural access, and the socio-managerial environment. Geographical access is influenced by location, distance, and the micro-physical environment and amenities of RCFs. Information access refers to the capability to acquire related information on available resources. Economic access is the financial affordability for the resources. Socio-cultural access is affected by individual attitudes and aggregative cultural values on ageing and care of older people. Additionally, the social-managerial environment such as reputations of RCFs, quality of services, and management mechanisms are also important to the decision-making process. All these factors influence older people and their family members' decision-making process of which RCF to choose. The research provides a multi-perspective analysis of access to residential care and suggestions on improving the accessibility of residential care for older people in Beijing. © Copyright 2011 Cambridge University Press.","access;

Many of these families, in addition to facing daily caregiving responsibilities, must travel substantial distances to access some of the necessary aspects of their child's health care. In this study, the Burke et al. (1994-1996) data of repeatedly hospitalized children and their families are used to explore a geographical dimension of family impact, distance. Outcome measures from the Feetham Family Functioning Survey and the Questionnaire on Resources and Stress are analyzed using exploratory and multivariate analysis. Results show that distance to hospital plays a role in the two areas of family life regarding relationships within the immediate family, and issues surrounding the ability to maintain the child in the family home. The implications of the results for family, health care intervention, and government policies and guidelines are discussed.

To support our theorization, grounded theory is used to capture and interpret the experiences of women caring for children with long-term care needs in the home. Eleven semi-structured interviews conducted with women in Ontario, Canada uncovered differences in the way the women perceived their homes and highlighted their multiple and complex experiences. The findings revealed three key issues. First, women do not want their homes to be completely defined by long-term care activities as many other types of activities are situated in their homes. Second, long-term care activities and schedules are not segregated but become deeply embedded and enmeshed within the spatial and temporal practices and processes of family life. Third, the meanings, characteristics and ideal of 'home' portrayed in popular culture and the academic literature often clashed with what the women experienced on a daily basis. Analysis revealed the tensions surrounding 'reconstructing spaces in the home' and 'the home as a private and public place' which are indicative of the women's struggles with the disjuncture between the ideal and lived home. The women's experiences challenge us to consider new ways of theorizing the home, and the home when it is a place where long-term care is provided.","Caregiving; Children; Health; Home; Long-term care","Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; child care; feminism; gender issue; health care; womens employment; womens status","","","","","Sick Kids Foundation","The authors wish to thank the journal editor, Robyn Longhurst, special issue editors and three anonymous referees for their valuable feedback.

In light of concerns that this language may be that of the presiding bureaucratic elite rather than the realities of those working directly with communities (Laverack & Labonte 2000), we question whether CCB reflects the work of New Zealand health promoters. The aim of this study is to assess what CCB means to health promoters and how relevant it is to their work in New Zealand. Focus groups and interviews were carried out with 64 health promoters between January 2008 and March 2009. The results of this qualitative study indicated that, while the terminology of CCB is poorly established in New Zealand, the overwhelming majority of participants felt that, to be an effective health promoter, they needed the buy-in and support of the communities in which they work. As a result, community-driven approaches have emerged as a core component of good health promotion practice in New Zealand. Yet, the concept of CCB was applied loosely with health promoters adopting language and practices corresponding more with the nuances of community development. The limited use of systematic approaches to building community capacity was accompanied by few successes achieving sustainable health promotion programmes. In prioritising community relationships many health promoters were placed in an ideological bind whereby achieving community ownership over health promotion meant compromising the evidence base of their programmes. Academic discussions of CCB appear to have gained little traction into the realm of health promotion practice in New Zealand highlighting the need for relevant research with a strong grounding in practice. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Community capacity building;

In this paper, the challenges of creating an effective PHWF are at first placed in the context of health promotion and global changes. Using recent experience from the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Canada and work carried out for the Pan American Health Organization, defining the PHW and what is required of a PHW to meet the challenges of health promotion and global changes are discussed. We conclude by assessing the prospects for creating an effective PHW within the framework of health promotion and global changes.","Global changes; Health promotion; Public health; SARS","Canada; atmospheric pollution; developing world; disease spread; health services; immunization; public health; severe acute respiratory syndrome","","","","","","","BARDEN-O-FALLON J., ANGELES G., TSUI, A.lmbalances in the Health Labour Force: An assessment using data from three national health facility surveys, Health Policy and Planning, 21, 2, pp. 80-90, (2006); BEAGLEHOLE R., DAL POZ M.R., Commentary: Public Health Workforce: Challenges and policy issues, Human Resources for Health, 1-4, (2003); J.

A similar question might be asked about Canada's population. The primary purpose of this paper is to answer this question from the perspective of a medical geographer. The analysis incorporates selected data on mortality and morbidity for various age and sex groups at national and regional levels and the findings of various researchers about the links betwen health and the environment. Thus, a second purpose of this paper is to inform the reader about the contributions medical geographers in Canada have made to our understanding of the status of the Canadian people's health. -Authors","","Canada; comparative studies; environmental conditions; health standard; medical geogaphers; public health status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026452492"

Communities across Canada age at different rates, and the forces underlying the differences, such as ""aging in place"" and migration, vary from community to community. we have identified two types of aging communities: service-rich communities, in which seniors have good health status and better amenities, and service-poor communities, in which seniors have poor health status and limited amenities. we also report on results for Atlantic Canada from a national study of service provisions. Three issues stand out: (a) the impact on communities of migration and aging in place, (b) the factors that distinguish service-rich and service-poor communities and (c) the conditions necessary to create a service-rich community. All levels of government in Atlantic Canada must work together to develop policies and programs that create and sustain servicerich communities.","","aging; article; community care; government; health care delivery; health care policy; health service; health status; migration; social welfare","","","","","","","Anderson M., Rosenberg M.W., Ontario's Underserviced Area Program revisited: An indirect analysis, Social Science and Medicine, 30, 1, pp. 35-44, (1990); Aronson J., Women's Sense of Responsibility for the Care of Old People: But who Else Is going to Do It?, Aging: Canadian Perspectives, (1994); Averill J., Keys to the Puzzle: Recognizing Strengths in a Rural Community, Public Health Nursing, 6, pp. 449-455, (2003); Bergob M., Destination Preferences and motives of Seniors and non-Senior Interprovincial migrants in Canada, Canadian Studies in Population, 22, pp. 31-48, (1995); Bryant T., Brown I., Cogan T., Dallaire C., Laforest S., McGowan P., Raphael D., Richard L., Thompson L., Young J., What do Canadian seniors say supports their quality of life?

It has also been demonstrated in various studies of women's health that measures of health and health behaviour vary over different geographic scales. Added into this mix is the fact that historically more women than men in relative terms are found on the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder. What has not been so well-developed is our understanding of the connections among health, gender, poverty and especially location. In 1998, Statistics Canada released the second wave of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS-2). Included with the NPHS-2 public use microdata file are measures of health status, gender, income and location which can be analyzed in the form of logistic regression models. Results are reported which provide a better understanding of the relative roles that gender, poverty and location play in the geography of inequalities.

This activism has continued in large cities alongside new streams of mobilization addressing the needs of groups such as women and Aboriginal peoples living with HIV. We draw on interviews conducted with six people living with HIV/AIDS in a small Ontario city where the population does not allow for services tailored to specific groups. We investigate experiences of social engagement amongst people living with, and affected by, HIV/AIDS and examine why efforts to establish a community-based participatory research project was unsuccessful.

(Health Promot Int 18(4): 339-350, 2003) we identify the role of stigma both amongst different groups living with HIV/AIDS and the wider public as undermining a common sense of community and, potentially, our efforts to establish a community-based participatory research process. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Community capacity; Community-based participatory research; HIV/AIDS","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Research; Common sense; Community capacity; Community-based participatory research; HIV/AIDS; Jackson; Large cities; Mobilisation; Ontario; Social engagement; Social identity; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; gender identity; health services; human immunodeficiency virus; indigenous population; mobilization; participatory approach; social problem; Diseases","","","","","","","Atkins G., Gay Seattle: Stories of Exile and Belonging, (2003); Baker E., Teaser-Polk C., Measuring community capacity: Where do we go from here?, Health Education and Behavior, 25, pp. 279-283, (1998); Bourdieu P., Practical Reason: On the Theory of Action, (1998); Brown M., Ironies of distance: An ongoing critique of the geographies of AIDS, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 13, pp. 159-183, (1995); Brown M., Replacing Citizenship: AIDS, Activism and Radical Democracy, (1997); Brown T., AIDS, risk and social governance, Social Science and Medicine, 50, pp. 1273-1284, (2000); Campbell C., Mzaidume Y., Grassroots participation in health promotional projects: Peer education and HIV prevention by sex workers in South Africa, American Journal of Public Health, 91, 12, pp. 1978-1987, (2001); History of the Canadian AIDS society, (1994); Chiottie Q.P., Joseph A.E., Casey house: Interpreting the location of a Toronto AIDS hospice, Social Science and Medicine, 41, 1, pp. 131-140, (1995); Day G., Murdoch J., Locality and community: Coming to terms with place, The Sociological Review, 41, pp. 82-111, (1993); Dekonig K., Martin M., Participatory Research in Health: Issues and Experiences, (1996); Field J., Social Capital, (2003); Freire P., Pedagogy of the Oppressed, (1970); Geltmaker T., The queer nation acts up: Health care, politics, and sexual diversity in the County of Angels, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 10, pp. 609-650, (1992); Gonzalez E., Lehano R., Vidales G., Conner R., Kidokoro Y., Fazeli B., Cabrales R., Participatory action research for environmental health: Encountering Freire in the urban Barrio, Journal of Urban Affairs, 29, 1, pp. 77-100, (2007); Goodman R., Speers M., Mcleroy K., Fawcett S., Kegler M., Parker E., Et al., Identifying and defining the dimensions of community capacity to provide a basis for measurement, Health Education and Behavior, 25, pp. 258-278, (1998); Hall A., Community participation and rural development, Community Participation, Social Development and the State, pp. 13-44, (1986); HIV/AIDS in Canada.

A number of properties of the aging process are strongly differentiated at the county and township levels, variations which have considerable significance for the design and implementation of social service and health care systems. Using data from the 1976, 1981, and 1986 Censuses for Ontario, components of change in the elderly population are obtained by cohort survival methods. The significance of rapid metropolitan growth of the elderly compared with the slow growth of the rural elderly is highlighted, while intra‐county distributional shifts in the elderly population raise important questions for the next decade. Quoique l'âge de la population augmente rapidement à travers le Canada, ce changement nes'opèrepas de façon uniforme. Certaines caractéristiques du processus de vieillissement sont vraiment differentes à l'échelle des comtés et des municipalités. Ces différences sont d'une grande importance lors de la création etde l'implantation des services‐santé et des services sociaux. À l'aide des statistiques de recensement pour les années 1976, 1981, et 1986 pour l'Ontario, les facteurs de changement des populations de personnes âgées sont obtenus au moyen des paramètres de ‘survie des groupes.’ La signification du taux d'accroissement rapide des personnes âgés en milieu urbain comparé au taux d'accroissement plus lent de cesmêmes personnes en milieu rural est mise en évidence. Les variations de la distribution de cette population d'un comtéà I'autre soulèvent d'importantes interrogations pour la prochaine décade. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

This paper makes two arguments about rural housing research in Canada. The first is that the ‘rural’ is a complex housing landscape, not simply an undifferentiated ‘other’ in comparison to urban housing. The second is that this complexity has important implications for assessing changes to the local housing stock. The empirical content of the paper is drawn from three study areas in Canada where there is a mix of rural / agricultural and cottage area properties. Questions of housing stock change within these rural‐recreational countryside examples are examined using questionnaire and building permit data. The findings presented here support the contention that the rural landscape is in fact a complex housing landscape, and also support the view that unless this complexity is recognized, a coherent portrait of rural housing will not emerge. Les conditions et les besoins d'habitations rurales au Canada, sont aussi complexes que le paysage lui‐même, même si la littérature traite I'habitat rural en tant qu'unité“unique, dénuée de problèmes. Cet article présente deux arguments concernant la recherche sur I'habitat rural au Canada. En premier lieu, ‘rural’ decrit un paysage contenant des habitations complexes et pas simplement une ‘autre chose’ non‐déstincte par rapport a I'habitat urbain. Deuxidmèment, cette complexité a des conséquences importantes qui ont un rapport avec les changements dans I'inventaire local des habitations. Le contenu de l'article est basé sur trois Études de cas au Canada où il y a un mélange de propriétés rurales, agricoles et vacancyères. Les questions concernant le changement dans I'inventaire des habitations pour ces examples ruraux et vacanciers, sont reliées à des donnés de questionnaires et aux permis de construction. Les résultats présentés ici, confirment l'argument qu'un paysage rural est en fait un paysage complexe d'habitations. lis confirment aussi I'idée qu'un portrait cohérent de I'habitat rural n'apparaitra pas, sauf si cette complexity est reconnue.

Using data from the 1991 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS), this paper incorporates a set of measures of traditional activities within a determinants of health framework for understanding First Nations peoples' health. Results from the analyses undertaken show that many of the determinants of health identified in analyses of the Canadian population in general hold for First Nations peoples. While only a few statistically significant relationships between health status and traditional activities were identified, taking into account the limitations of the APS and other conceptual issues, we argue that there is the potential to move from the analysis of traditional activities to a more nuanced analysis of cultural attachment. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Of late, there has been a renewed interest in voluntary welfare provision as a viable alternative to state and market. Recent developments in welfare provision in Canada appear to have brought greater social care roles for the voluntary sector at the same time as new and arguably more restrictive funding and accountability mechanisms are being imposed by different arms of the state. To explore these issues more closely, the present paper examines the impressions and experiences of voluntary and formal sector providers of services for senior citizens and people with disabilities in a remote urban centre (population less than 100 000) in the interior of British Columbia, Canada. Two important operational pressures provide the context of the analysis: (1) reform of provincial government funding and regulation of voluntary services; and (2) the restructuring of welfare provision, especially in the areas of health care and social services. The authors found evidence of an escalating incursion of the state into local voluntary sector affairs that needs to be understood in the context of long-standing institutional links between government and 'professional' voluntary welfare provision in British Columbia. The results point to three important directions in contemporary local voluntary provision: (1) an emerging ethos of accountability, efficiency and competition in voluntary provision; (2) increasing pressure to centralise volunteer services; and consequently, (3) the potential erosion of flexibility and personalisation that are seen to characterise the voluntary sector. © 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","British Columbia; Canada; Local voluntary sector; Social care; Welfare restructuring","Attitude of Health Personnel; British Columbia; Disabled Persons; Financing, Government; Health Services for the Aged; Home Care Services; Humans; Interviews; Outsourced Services; Public Sector; Social Welfare; Social Work; Urban Population; Voluntary Workers; article; Canada; disabled person; economics; elderly care; financial management; health personnel attitude; home care; human; interview; organization and management; social welfare; social work; urban population; voluntary worker","","","","","","","Guidelines: Applying for A Direct Access Program Grant., (2004); (2006); Berg B., Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences., (2004); Billis D., Glennerster H., Human services and the voluntary sector: Towards a theory of comparative advantage, Journal of Social Policy, 27, 1, pp. 79-98, (1998); Burnley C., Matthews C., McKenzie S., Devolution of services to children and families: The experience of NPOs in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada, Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 16, 1, pp. 69-87, (2005); (2005); (2005); Chouinard V., Crooks V., Because they have all the power and i have none': State restructuring of income and employment supports and disabled women's lives in Ontario, Canada, Disability and Society, 20, 1, pp. 19-32, (2005); Cohen M., Murphy J., Nutland K., Ostry A., Continuing Care Renewal or Retreat?

The Underserviced Area Program of Ontario is the longest running financial incentive program in Canada. It is described in detail and analyzed for its effectiveness in solving the problems of the maldistribution of physicians in northern Ontario. Using location quotients as an indirect measure shows that the maldistribution of physicians continues despite the implementation of the program. It is argued that the unidimensional solution of financial incentives cannot be used to solve the multidimensional issue of accessibility to health care in rural and remote areas. © 1990.","accessibility; location quotients; physician maldistribution","Economics, Medical; Health Services Accessibility; Medically Underserved Area; National Health Programs; Ontario; Personnel Management; Physician Incentive Plans; Rural Health; Canada, Ontario; accessibility; health care; physician maldistribution; canada; conference paper; geographic distribution; health service; methodology; physician","","","","","University of Asia Pacific, UAP; Ministry of Northern; Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social, MISAN","from northern communities regarding accessibility specialistsd ue mainly to communitiesn ot providing to physician services.

Canadian studies are not conclusive; most indicate that there is no relationship between income inequality and health within Canada. There is a need for further investigation into the validity of the 'relative income' hypothesis in the Canadian population. The primary objective of this research was to test the 'relative income' hypothesis across Canadian health regions. The second objective was to extend the hypothesis to consider rural versus urban populations. METHODS: This research involved ecological analyses. The source of the data was the Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 3.1. The units of analysis were Canadian health regions. Health of a region was estimated as the percentage of people who rated their health as good or excellent. The primary exposure variable was the ratio of people whose personal income was less than $15,000 relative to those reporting more than $80,000 in the year preceding the survey. This ratio provided a measure of the distribution of income. The main covariates were ecological measures of socio-demographic variables, social capital, substance use behaviours (smoking and alcohol consumption), rural/urban status of the region, and absolute income in the region. Correlation analyses and multiple linear regressions were performed to ascertain the relationship between income inequality and population health, adjusting for important covariates. RESULTS: The measure of income inequality alone appeared to explain 18% of the variability in the measure of population health. However, after adding the measure of absolute income to the model, although 29% of the variability was explained, the independent contribution of the inequality measure became non-significant. Linear regression models suggested that the absolute income variable alone could explain 30% of the variance in the health status of populations. Other variables with a statistically significant contribution to the final model were education and alcohol consumption. The effect of rural/urban geographic status on the relationship of interest was similar to other covariates. This variable did not change the individual relationship between income inequality or absolute income and the measure of population health status. In both rural and urban regions, absolute income and education had positive effects on population health. In urban regions alcohol consumption was a significant negative contributor to population health status; whereas, in rural regions, smoking status had a significant negative effect on population health status. CONCLUSION: Across Canadian health regions, health status in populations was a function of absolute income but not relative income. Regions with higher levels of education had better levels of self-rated health. A larger percentage of heavy drinkers was also correlated with lower population health status. Findings were consistently observed in rural and urban populations. The study findings have implications for public health, economic, and social policies.","","Age Factors; Canada; Health Services; Health Status Disparities; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Substance-Related Disorders; Urban Population; addiction; age; article; Canada; health disparity; health service; health survey; human; income; rural population; sex difference; social support; socioeconomics; statistics; urban population; utilization review","","","","","","","","A.

One of the implications of this shift in the site of care is that individuals with long-term care needs and their family care providers experience social and spatial isolation. Many are housebound and most face considerable challenges in getting out of the house. This paper illuminates these challenges as they are experienced by mothers of children with long-term care needs, and the resulting isolation and disconnection that they experience. Eleven semistructured interviews were conducted in two regions of Ontario, Canada. Grounded theory informed the analysis of the mothers' accounts of their experiences of getting out of the house. The present findings are derived from a larger investigation of the meanings and experiences of the home as a place of caring for families with children who have long-term care needs. Secondary analysis of the data found that three main challenges restricted the mothers' abilities to leave their houses. Mothers experienced difficulties getting out of the house when they attempted to leave with the child, and when the child was left with an alternative care provider. Physical challenges were associated with the work and planning required in moving the child's equipment and supplies, meticulous planning of the outing within the daily schedule, and navigating barriers in the built and natural environments. Social challenges reflected the lack of people within the mothers' social network of family and friends who have the knowledge and expertise to care for the child. Service challenges resulted from the gaps between the policies and practices of paid respite, and the conditions that must be satisfied in order for mothers to be able and/or willing to leave the house. The authors also examined the reasons why some of the mothers worked from home, and the strategies that they used to get out of the house for employment. In this paper, the authors discuss each challenge, and how it contributes to the mothers' social and spatial isolation. The mothers' experiences elucidate the differences between living in a community and being part of a community. The consequences of the isolation on mothers' daily lives are not recognised in home and community care policy. The suggestions that are put forward concerning paid respite have relevance for home and community care policy and practice. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Children; Disability; Isolation; Long-term care;

Elevated levels were found for blood lead, serum creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen in the mining area with mean values at 245.65 μg/l, 74.16 μmol/l, and 12.79 mmol/l, which were significantly higher than those in the control area, respectively. Moreover, the coefficients between paired results for blood lead and serum creatinine and blood lead and serum urea nitrogen were positively statistically significant (serum creatinine vs. blood lead, r = 0.35, p < 0.05; serum urea nitrogen vs. blood lead, r = 0.48, p < 0.05). With respect to the effects of sex and age on the blood lead, serum creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen levels, data analysis revealed there was a tendency for higher blood lead, serum creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen levels in females than in males, and the levels of blood lead, serum creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen increased among older residents. We conclude that females and the older population in the mining area are more susceptible to lead exposure. Blood lead, serum creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen can be useful biomarkers of lead exposure among populations under environmental stress. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biomarker;

With data from the National Population Health Survey, undertaken in 1994-95, the authors examine the health status of Canada's elderly population using 3 sets of measures: level of activity limitations, prevalence of chronic illnesses and self-assessment of overall health. They also analyse the utilization of physician and institutional services. The profile of this population the authors develop is in many respects not much different from that of the remaining adult population, until the age of 75. People aged 75 and over are much more likely than other adults to have health problems and use health care services. Also, elderly women living alone and with low income are identified as an especially vulnerable group who need access to medical and nonmedical services if they are to remain in the community. Using Statistics Canada projection data the authors discuss some aspects of the elderly population's health status in the future. Their look into the future raises issues about the preparedness of health care providers and our health care system to meet the challenges of tomorrow's elderly population.","","aged; aging; Canada; chronic disease; daily life activity; health care need; health care utilization; health status; health survey; human; lowest income group; policy; review; self evaluation","","","","","","","Barer M.L., Evans R.G., Hertzman C., Avalanche or glacier?

Given that some key health-risk behaviours for stillbirth, including smoking and pre-pregnancy obesity, have strong relationships with SES, health-risk behaviours may serve as a channel through which low SES contributes to stillbirth outcomes. The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of the relationship between low SES and the occurrence of stillbirth that is explained by health-risk behaviours in populations of Eastern Ontario and Nova Scotia (112 stillbirth cases and 398 controls). Both area and individual level influences of SES were assessed. The study population consisted of 112 cases (women delivering stillborn infants) and 398 controls. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals estimated by multivariable logistic regression were used to approximate relative risks. The contribution of health-risk behaviours to relationships between SES and stillbirth was assessed by a change in the relative risk estimate following omission of each health-risk behaviour from the model. Of the three measures of individual level SES examined (household income, education, Blishen occupational index), only household income was a statistically significant predictor of stillbirth. After controlling for individual level SES, no community level SES effects were observed for stillbirth. Adjustments for key health-risk behaviours (smoking) resulted in an 18.5% reduction in the odds ratio estimate for low SES, from 3.31 to 2.79. This large unexplained SES effect that remained highlights the need for research into other potential pathways that may account for increased risk of stillbirth among those of lower SES. © 2008 The Authors.","Fertility treatment; Health behaviour; Maternal smoking; Socio-economic status; Stillbirth","Adolescent; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Maternal Age; Multivariate Analysis; Nova Scotia; Ontario; Pregnancy; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Smoking; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Stillbirth; adult; article; controlled study; educational status; female; health behavior; health hazard; human; income; major clinical study; obesity; risk factor; smoking; socioeconomics; stillbirth","","","","","","","Cnattingius S., Stephansson O., The epidemiology of stillbirth, Seminars in Perinatology, 26, pp. 25-30, (2002); Pasupathy D., Smith G.C., The analysis of factors predicting antepartum stillbirth, Minerva Ginecologica, 57, pp. 397-410, (2005); Baird D., The influence of social and economic conditions on stillbirth and neonatal deaths, Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the British Commonwealth, 52, pp. 217-254, (1945); Tuthill D., Stewart J.H., Coles E.C., Andrews J., Cartlidge P.H.T., Maternal cigarette smoking and pregnancy outcome, Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, 13, pp. 245-253, (1999); Stephansson O., Dickman P.W., Johansson A.L.V., Cnattingius S., The influence of socio-economic status on stillbirth risk in Sweden, International Journal of Epidemiology, 30, pp. 1296-1301, (2001); Huang D.Y., Usher R.H., Kramer M.S., Yang H., Morin L., Fretts R.C., Determinants of unexplained antepartum fetal deaths, Obstetrics and Gynecology, 95, pp. 215-221, (2000); Copper R.L., Goldenberg R.L., Dubard M.B., David R.O., Risk factors for fetal death in white, black and hispanic women, Obstetrics and Gynecology, 84, pp. 490-495, (1994); McIntosh I., Smoking and pregnancy.

The analysis is based on interviews with 55 key informants from local governments, health and social care agencies, voluntary sector organizations, and community groups. The findings reveal the paradox of the conventional belief that rural communities can compensate for lack of services for seniors while failing to take into account the uncertain coping ability of the local informal sectors. The authors challenge rural health policy decision-makers, researchers, and providers to debunk assumptions about services for seniors in rural Canada.","Aging; Gerontology; Rural and remote health; Social support; Theory","Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Canada; Community Health Services; Consumer Participation; Health Care Surveys; Health Policy; Health Services for the Aged; Health Services Needs and Demand; Home Care Services; Humans; National Health Programs; Nursing Methodology Research; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Rural Health Services; aged; article; Canada; community care; consumer; elderly care; epidemiology; health care policy; health personnel attitude; health service; home care; human; nursing methodology research; organization and management; public health; qualitative research; questionnaire; rural health care","","","","","","","Andrews G.J., McCormack B., Reed J., The importance of place in older people's care: Three papers developing the geographies of nursing work, Journal of Clinical Nursing, 14, 8 B, pp. 98-99, (2005); Bradshaw M., Stratford E., Qualitative research design and rigour, Qualitative research methods in human geography, pp. 67-78, (2005); Cloke P., Conceptualizing rurality, Handbook of rural studies, pp. 18-28, (2005); Cloutier-Fisher D., Joseph A.E., Long-term care restructuring in rural Ontario: Retrieving community service user and provider narratives, Social Science and Medicine, 50, pp. 1037-1045, (2000); Cloutier-Fisher D., Skinner M.W., Levelling the playing field?

A total of 198 organizations and 65 individuals were surveyed at baseline, throughout the intervention, immediately post-intervention, and one year post-intervention. Knowledge from 783 studies was spread to 63,387 people, 90 per cent of whom reported knowledge exchange. Over 50 per cent of stakeholders reported using the research evidence, although processes for facilitating knowledge choice did not achieve consensus.

It focuses on the empirical case of Ontario, Canada where extensive restructuring of long-term care, under the rubric of managed competition, has been underway since the mid-1990s. In-depth interviews with 72 representatives from local governments, public health institutions and authorities, for-profit and non-profit organisations, and community groups during July 2003 to December 2003 form the platform for a qualitative analysis of the implications of managed competition as it relates to the provision of long-term care in the countryside. The results suggest that the introduction and implementation of managed competition has accentuated the problems of service provision in rural communities, and that the long-standing issues of caregiving in rural situations transcend the differences, perceived or otherwise, between for-profit and non-profit provision. Understanding the implications of market-oriented long-term care restructuring initiatives for providers, and their clients, in rural situations requires a re-focussing of research beyond the for- versus non-profit dichotomy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Active-obese persons often have similar or lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality than inactive-healthy weight persons; however, the combined PA-weight status effects on HRQL are unclear. The aim was to investigate the combined association of PA and body mass index (BMI) with HRQL in Canadian adults and older adults. Methods: Cross-sectional data included 110,986 participants 18 yr from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey, representing an estimated 22,563,527 Canadians. HRQL indicators included: Self-Rated Health (SRH), Participation and Activity Limitation due to illness/injury (PAL), and Total Disability Days (physical + mental) during the past 14 d (TDD). Prevalence of adverse HRQL was estimated by BMI, PA, and combined BMI-PA categories. Adjusted logistic regression was used to assess the odds of adverse HRQL by BMI, PA, and BMI-PA. Analyses were stratified by sex and age (18-44, 45-64, 65 yr). Results: In both men and women of all ages, inactive individuals had greater likelihood of fair/poor SRH, and sometimes/often PAL, at all BMI levels; conversely, in active individuals, being underweight, overweight, or obese had little effect on SRH and PAL. Associations were weaker for TDD, where the greatest influence was in older adults from inactivity combined with underweight. Overweight showed less association to HRQL in males and older adults, whereas underweight showed stronger association in males and older adults. Conclusions: When examining BMI-PA in combination, PA emerges as the more important correlate of HRQL, regardless of weight status. This reinforces the importance of PA to health outcomes over and above the benefits related to weight loss or maintenance. © 2012 by the American College of Sports Medicine.","activity limitation; adults; body mass index; health status; physical activity; Quality of life","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Canada; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; article; body mass; body weight; Canada; cross-sectional study; female; health status; health survey; human; male; middle aged; motor activity; physiology; prevalence; quality of life; statistics","","","","","","","Abu-Omar K., Rutten A., Robine J.-M., Self-rated health and physical activity in the European Union, Sozial- und Praventivmedizin, 49, 4, pp. 235-242, (2004); Adams K.F., Schatzkin A., Harris T.B., Kipnis V., Mouw T., Ballard-Barbash R., Hollenbeck A., Leitzmann M.F., Overweight, obesity, and mortality in a large prospective cohort of persons 50 to 71 years old, New England Journal of Medicine, 355, 8, pp. 763-778, (2006); Adams S.A., Matthews C.E., Ebbeling C.B., Moore C.G., Cunningham J.E., Fulton J., Hebert J.R., The effect of social desirability and social approval on self-reports of physical activity, American Journal of Epidemiology, 161, 4, pp. 389-398, (2005); Beland Y., Canadian Community Health Survey-methodological overview, Health Rep, 13, 3, pp. 9-14, (2002); Benyamini Y., Leventhal E.A., Leventhal H., Gender differences in processing information for making self-assessments of health, Psychosomatic Medicine, 62, 3, pp. 354-364, (2000); Bize R., Johnson J.A., Plotnikoff R.C., Physical activity level and health-related quality of life in the general adult population: A systematic review, Preventive Medicine, 45, 6, pp. 401-415, (2007); Brown D.W., Balluz L.S., Heath G.W., Moriarty D.G., Ford E.S., Giles W.H., Mokdad A.H., Associations between recommended levels of physical activity and health-related quality of life: Findings from the 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, Preventive Medicine, 37, 5, pp. 520-528, (2003); Measuring Healthy Days: Population Assessment of Health-Related Quality of Life, (2000); Colley R., Garriguet D., Janssen I., Craig C.L., Clarke J., Tremblay M.S., Physical activity of Canadian adults: Accelerometer results from the 2007 to 2009 canadian health measures survey, Health Rep., 22, 1, pp. 7-14, (2011); Gorber S.C., Tremblay M., Moher D., Gorber B., A comparison of direct vs. self-report measures for assessing height, weight and body mass index: A systematic review, Obesity Reviews, 8, 4, pp. 307-326, (2007); Fogelholm M., Physical activity, fitness and fatness: Relations to mortality, morbidity and disease risk factors.

In Spain, those who need such help constitute about 20 per cent of the population aged 65 or more years. Support may be from formal care, informal care or both, and the type has different consequences for care receivers and their social networks. The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between informal and formal care and the use of health services among older people in Spain. Using a sample of 1,148 respondents aged 65 or more years from the Spanish National Health Survey of 2003, we analysed the association between the sources of care (formal, informal, both, or no care) and the frequency of three types of health-care utilisation: hospitalisation, emergency services and medical consultations. After controlling for sex, age, level of difficulty in the activities of daily living, self-perceived health status, and social class, it was found that older people with disabilities who received neither informal nor formal care were more likely to consult physicians than those who received informal care, but that there were no significant relationships between the type of care and health-services utilisation. The findings provide new information about the consequences of the different types of care of older people with disabilities, and suggest specifically that informal care substitutes for some tasks usually done by health professionals. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.","Disabled older people; Formal care; Health services; Informal care; Spain","Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; aging population; disability; health services","","","","","Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD, (BES-2004-6170, BSO2003-00401); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, CSIC, (I3P-BPD2003-1, SEC2002-00504)","This work was supported through grants from the Spanish Council for Scientific Research – CSIC – (I3P-BPD2003-1, reference project SEC2002-00504) and the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (BES-2004-6170, reference project BSO2003-00401).

Methods: A study population of 569 bladder, 592 colon, and 558 rectal cancer cases and 1549 controls was used to investigate health risk behaviors and SES effects. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) estimated by multivariate logistic regression approximated relative risks. The explanatory role of health risk behaviors was assessed by the change in the risk estimate on SES following their omission from the model. Results: For each cancer site, individual education remained a predictor of risk after controlling for health risk behaviors. Adjustments for health risk behaviors (smoking) shifted the age- and sex-adjusted relative risk (RR) associated with bladder cancer from 2.24 to 1.74 (29.5%). No health risk behaviors (smoking, diet, obesity) resulted in substantial change in the low education risk estimates for colon cancer (RR = 2.88) or rectal cancer (RR = 2.42). Conclusions: Given the strength of SES relationships persisting after adjustment for health risk behaviors, this study suggests that our knowledge of SES pathways and risk factors for bladder, colon, and rectal cancers is incomplete. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

K7L 3N6, Canada","The 1984 Canada Health Act (CHA) is the major piece of Federal legislation that governs health care accessibility in the provinces and territories. According to the CHA, all provinces and territories in Canada must uphold five principles in order to receive federal funding for health care (universality, comprehensiveness, portability, public administration, and accessibility). In Canada, there are competing views among policy makers and consumers about how the CHA's principle of accessibility should be defined, interpreted and used in delivering health care. During the 1990s, the health care perceptions of Canadians and their health care behaviours were measured through both public opinion polls and Statistics Canada's National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The goal of this paper is to examine perceptions of accessibility in public opinion polls and actual accessibility as measured through the NPHS. Public opinion polls demonstrate that while Canadians want to preserve the principles of the CHA, a majority of Canadians are losing confidence in their health care system. In contrast, the results from the NPHS reveal that only 6% of Canadians aged 25 years and older have experienced accessibility problems. Among those who report access problems, the barriers to accessibility are linked to specific socio-economic, socio-demographic and health characteristics of individuals. We discuss these findings in the context of the current debates surrounding accessibility within the CHA and the Canadian health care system. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Data from interviews were analyzed using the Discourse Collective Subject method. Interviewees spent, on average, the equivalent of 40% of their water bill for the public water supply on the purchase of bottled water. The decision about water consumption in the household was predominantly made by women. Interviewees were particularly concerned with health risks and expressed a strong preference for the safety and organoleptic qualities of bottled water, particularly in cases where the tap water supply did not fully meet the regulated water quality standards. Interviewees were largely unaware of the origin, type, storage, and social and environmental impacts of bottled water. Results highlight the importance of water education efforts among the general population and the key role of women in the processes related to drinking water. The need for gender-specific interventions and the empowerment of women on water issues is noted. Results also strongly support the relevance of ensuring the provision of safe drinking water, from the source to the consumption point, with the trust of consumers. © IWA Publishing 2013.","Bottled water; Drinking water consumption; Tap water; Water perceptions","Adolescent; Adult; Brazil; Drinking; Drinking Water; Female; Financing, Personal; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Perception; Water Quality; Brazil; tap water; water; consumption behavior; data acquisition; drinking water; empowerment; perception; preference behavior; public attitude; water supply; womens status; article; Brazil; consumer; decision making; empowerment; environmental impact; health education; health hazard; household; human; interview; packaging; perception; purchasing; safety; storage; water quality; water supply","","water, 7732-18-5; Drinking Water, ","","","","","Ahmad M., Bajahlan A.S., Quality comparison of tap water vs. Bottled water in the industrial city of Yanbu, Environ.

Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews were completed with 70 young men and women (15-24 years). In total, 22 service providers (for example, clinicians, staff) were interviewed about their experiences providing STI testing services as well as the policies and practice guidelines that inform their work with youths. In addition, naturalistic observation was conducted at 11 clinic sites, including: youth clinics, doctors' offices, public health units and a large clinic specialising in STI testing. Results: ""Youth-friendly"" STI testing services were rare despite being strongly desired by youth and service providers. Participants identified five barriers to accessing and/or providing youth-friendly STI testing: geography isolates many youths from testing service times or services, and presents privacy concerns, especially for rural youths. Clinic décor was perceived to be tailored for women and most service providers were female. Disclosing risky sexual behaviour to clinicians may be difficult for youths, especially for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths - particularly in contexts that are perceived to be homophobic. Many young women mistakenly believe that Pap smears include STI testing procedures, while many young men avoid testing because they fear the urethral swab and are unaware of alternative methods of specimen collection. Conclusion: This research reveals how structural and socio-cultural forces (for example, gender, place, physical space, culture) interact to shape the experiences of youths accessing STI testing services.","","Adolescent; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Attitude of Health Personnel; British Columbia; Female; Health Policy; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Satisfaction; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Qualitative Research; Rural Health; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; article; bisexuality; Canada; community; demography; fear; female; health care personnel; health care policy; health service; human; interpersonal communication; interview; juvenile; lesbian; male; male homosexual; normal human; outpatient department; Papanicolaou test; practice guideline; priority journal; public health; public health service; screening test; sexual behavior; sexually transmitted disease; transsexualism","","","","","","","Chlamydia Statistics, (2007); Gonorrhea Statistics, (2007); Sexually Transmitted Disease Control: Annual Report 1997; British Columbia Annual Summary of Reportable Diseases, (2007); Miller W.C., Screening for chlamydial infection: Are we doing enough?, Lancet, 365, pp. 456-458, (2005); Peralta L., Deeds B.G., Hipszer S., Ghalib K., Barriers and facilitators to adolescent HIV testing, AIDS Patient Care and STDs, 21, 6, pp. 400-408, (2007); Bond L., Lauby J., Batson H., HIV testing and the role of individual- And structural-level barriers and facilitators, AIDS Care - Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AIDS/HIV, 17, 2, pp. 125-140, (2005); Shoveller J.A., Johnson J.L., Savoy D., Et al., Preventing sexually transmitted infections among adolescents: An assessment of ecological approaches and study methods, Sex Educ, 6, pp. 163-183, (2006); Robin L., Dittus P., Whitaker D., Crosby R., Ethier K., Mezoff J., Miller K., Pappas-Deluca K., Behavioral interventions to reduce incidence of HIV, STD, and pregnancy among adolescents: A decade in review, Journal of Adolescent Health, 34, 1, pp. 3-26, (2004); Card J.J., Teen Pregnancy prevention: Do any programs work?, Annu Rev Public Health, 20, pp. 257-285, (1999); Ellis S., Grey A., Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs): A Review of Reviews into the Effectiveness of Non-clinical Interventions, pp. 1-8, (2004); Dicenso A., Guyatt G., Willan A., Griffith L., Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials, British Medical Journal, 324, 7351, pp. 1426-1430, (2002); Mantell J.E., Dworkin S.L., Exner T.M., Et al., The promises and limitations of female-initiated methods of HIV/STI protection, SSM, 62, pp. 1998-2009, (2006); Shoveller J.A., Johnson J.L., Langille D.B., Et al., Socio-cultural influences on young people's sexual development, SSM, 59, pp. 473-487, (2004); Goldenberg S., Shoveller J., Ostry A., Et al., Youth sexual behaviour in a 'Boomtown': Implications for the control of sexually transmitted infections, STI, 84, pp. 220-223, (2008); Shoveller J., Johnson J., Prkachin K., Et al., Around here, they roll up the sidewalks at night"": A qualitative study of youth living in a rural Canadian community, Health Place, 13, pp. 826-838, (2007); Kapphahn C.J., Wilson K.M., Klein J.D., Adolescent girls' and boys' preference for provider gender and confidentiality in their health care, J Adolesc Health, 25, pp. 131-142, (1999); Goldenberg S., Shoveller J., Koehoorn M., Ostry A., Barriers to STI testing among youth in a Canadian oil and gas community, Health and Place, 14, 4, pp. 718-729, (2008); Tilson E.C., Sanchez V., Ford C.L., Smurzynski M., Leone P.A., Fox K.K., Irwin K., Miller W.C., Barriers to asymptomatic screening and other STD services for adolescents and young adults: Focus group discussions, BMC Public Health, 4, pp. 1-8, (2004); Community Profiles, 2006 Census, (2006); Community Profiles, 2006 Census, (2006); Community Profiles, 2006 Census, (2006); Community Profiles, 2006 Census, (2006); Definitions of Rural.

The case of remote passenger rail services in northern Manitoba is used to investigate these issues. The net present costs of alternative air and bus services are examined and their implications for the regional economy and tourism are analysed. The general conclusions that can be drawn are that alternative services can provide an improved quality of service, but only under certain conditions are they likely to cost less and have a positive impact on the regional economy. -Authors","","Canada; Manitoba; railway service; regional development; rural community; transport cost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026958169"

Drawing on a qualitative analysis of six medium-sized cities in Ontario, we capture the views of local leaders in different economic, demographic, and geographical contexts to understand the challenges, implications, and opportunities for community development as their populations age. We chose to capture the regional differences that exist between two rapidly growing suburban municipalities of the Greater Toronto Area and four cities in northern, eastern, and southwestern Ontario that face the dual challenges of industrial restructuring and an aging population. We also provide a case study involving two of these cities where local leaders actively encourage the in-migration of seniors from other communities as a strategy for economic development and growth. The findings suggest that local leaders across Ontario generally embrace an age-friendly view, but acknowledge there will be challenges to meeting the needs of a large older population, especially with regards to health and long-term care. © 2013 Canadian Association of Geographers / L' Association canadienne des géographes.","age-friendly communities; apocalyptic demography; Canada; economic development; Population aging","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; aging population; community resource management; demography; economic development; economic growth; elderly population; governance approach; health care","","","","","","","Allan D., Cloutier-Fisher D., Health service utilization among older adults in British Columbia: Making sense of geography, Canadian Journal on Aging, 25, 2, pp. 219-232, (2006); Amin A., Post-Fordism: Models, fantasies and phantoms of transition, Post-Fordism: A Reader, pp. 1-39, (1994); Andrews G.J., Phillips D.R., Moral dilemmas and the management of private residential homes: The impact of care in the community reforms in the UK, Ageing and Society, 20, 5, pp. 599-622, (2000); Ageing and Place: Perspectives, Policy and Practice, (2004); Beaujot R., Kerr D., Population Change in Canada.

Using the Statistics Canada 1996-97 National Population Health Survey-Health File, we then examine the profile of alternative service users. Our analysis shows that use of alternative health care is still limited to a relatively small segment of Canadians whose profile is similar to those in other developed countries. Women are more likely than men to use alternative medicines, therapies and practices, as are those who have higher incomes and are better educated. To move what has been an essentially empirical discussion forward, we explore critiques of conventional medical practice and propose that the analysis of alternative health care be situated within the geographies of consumption.

The Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP), which was established by the international global environmental change research programs (i.e., DIVERSITAS, IGBP, IHDP and WCRP) facilitates the study of this system in order to understand how and why it is changing, and to explore the implications of these changes for global and regional sustainability. Crucial to this scientific enterprise are interdisciplinary Joint Projects on carbon, food, water and health. This paper analyses the scientific and institutional evolution of ESSP as a framework for interdisciplinary and integrative research of societal relevance. Case studies on food systems, carbon budgets, water security and biodiversity conservation illustrate how these projects have advanced integrated Earth system knowledge. At the institutional level, we explain the transformation of the ESSP governance and how this has further enabled interdisciplinary research. The lessons learnt from ESSP research can contribute to the development of the next generation of Earth system science for sustainability. © 2012.","","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; environmental change; global change; governance approach; institutional framework; integrated approach; interdisciplinary approach; research program; sustainability","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1134890); Natural Environment Research Council, NERC","Funding text 1: The governing body of the ESSP, for the first six years of its existence (2001–2006), consisted of the chairs and directors of the GEC programs. This body made the executive decisions and the Joint Project Executive Officers were invited to provide scientific input to the meetings. In September 2005, with financial support from the National Science Foundation (USA) and other funders, a small ESSP Coordination Office was established. International Project Offices were also established and the Joint Projects began to develop impressive networks of researchers involved in Joint Project interdisciplinary research. By 2006 around ten professional staff were involved in research coordinating activities and hundreds were actively pursuing the research agendas of the Joint Projects. ; Funding text 2: In addition to innovative science planning and delivery approaches, addressing this charge required innovative project governance and funding approaches. The governance of research to address the charge needed to learn from the programs’ Core Project experience, but be modified to allow the stronger input from nonresearch stakeholders. GECAFS governance was therefore designed to foster the necessary interactions between a wider stakeholders community: international agencies, donors as well as researchers. A Scientific Advisory Committee was established comprising representatives from such groups; and an Executive Committee charged with implementation comprised representatives from the sponsoring program secretariats. This avoided an approach based on a single Scientific Steering Committee, which had to deal with both strategy and detail. It also helped ensure uptake of research results by leading collaborating agencies (e.g., FAO and CGIAR). GECAFS funding strategy was dependent on developing a research agenda that would appeal to both science and development donor communities. The continual core funding (from the Natural Environment Research Council of UK) was instrumental in levering research funds from some 25 different science and development agencies.

One of the important land uses identified within the urban field is recreation. This paper focuses on cottage property ownership in one part of the urban field, the rural-recreational countryside. Using three case studies from Canada, it was found that cottage properties account for a large proportion of local residential property. Although most cottage properties are owned by urban residents, up to one-quarter are owned by local residents. Using a questionnaire survey, it was also found that cottage owners are more likely to be older, better educated, and have higher incomes than rural residents. © 1995 by Association of American Geographers.","Cottagers; Rural-recreational countryside; Urban field","Canada; cottager; property ownership; recreational use; urban field; urban residents","","","","","External Research Program of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation","‘Some of the data presented were originally collected for Remeatimal Home Conversion in Canada (Rosenberg and Halseth 1993), which was supported through the External Research Program of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.","Bekkering M., Patterns of Change in the Spatial Distribution of Canada’s Elderly, (1990); Brunet Y., L’exode urbain, essai de classification de la population exurbaine des Cantons de l’Est, Canadian Geographer, 24, pp. 105-385, (1980); Bryant C.R., Russwurm L.H., McLellan A.G., The City’s Countryside—Land and Its Management in the Rural-Urban Fringe, (1982); Cloke P., Goodwin M., Conceptualizing countryside change: From post-Fordism to rural structured coherence, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 17, pp. 321-336, (1992); Clout H.D., Residences Secondaires in France, Second Homes: Curse Or Blessing, pp. 47-62, (1977); Coppock J.T., Second Homes: Curse Or Blessing, (1977); Cross A.W., The Summer House—A Tradition of Leisure, (1992); Davies S., Yeates M., Exurbanization as a component of migration: A case study in Oxford County, Ontario, Canadian Geographer, 35, pp. 177-186, (1991); Feitelson E., The potential of mail surveys in geography: Some empirical evidence, Professional Geographer, 43, pp. 190-205, (1991); Flora C.B., Christenson J.A., Rural Policies for The, (1991); Friedmann J., Miller J., The urban field, Journal of the American Institute of Planners 31:312—, (1965); Gardavsky V., Second homes in Czechoslovakia, Second Homes: Curse Or Blessing, pp. 63-74, (1977); Geipel R., Territoriality at the microscale, Person, Place and Thing: Interpretive and Empirical Essays in Cultural Geography, (1992); Gill A., Clark P., Second-home development in the resort municipality of Whistler, British Columbia, British Columbia: Geographical Essays in Honour of A.

Whereas attention has mainly focused on the exploration of relevant domains, subjective well-being, and representations of health in aging, less consideration has been given to relations among different QoL domains. We aimed in this research to identify connections between subjective health and other relevant domains from the perspective of older adults. We identified four central categories: adaptation to the limits of health in aging; seeking a balance in subjective health and QoL in aging; sense of place in centers for older people; and health and family interrelated dimensions of QoL in old age. According to the participants, the family domain positively impacts health as a consequence of contacts, support, and accomplishments. It might also have a negative impact as a result of a relatives' death or severe disease. The qualitative QoL perspective contributes to capturing the multidimensionality of health, aging, and place. © The Author(s) 2010.","Grounded theory; Health; Older people; Quality of life; Western Europe","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Attitude to Health; Family Relations; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Social Support; Spain; aged; aging; article; attitude to health; family relation; female; health status; human; male; middle aged; qualitative research; quality of life; social support; Spain","","","","","","","Albrecht G.L., Devlieger P.J., The disability paradox: High quality of life against all odds, Social Science Medicine, 48, 8, pp. 977-988, (1999); Andrews G.J., Cutchin M., McCracken K., Phillips D.R., Wiles J., Geographical gerontology: The constitution of a discipline, Social Science Medicine, 65, 1, pp. 151-168, (2007); Bowling A., Dieppe P., What is successful ageing and who should define it?, BMJ, 331, pp. 24-31, (2005); Brown J., Bowling A., Flynn T.N., Models of quality of life, A Taxonomy And Systematic Review Of The Literature, (2004); Bryant L.L., Corbett K.K., Kutner J.S., Their own words: A model of healthy aging, Social Science Medicine, 53, 7, pp. 927-941, (2001); Cleaver M., Muller T.E., I want to pretend i'm eleven years younger: Subjective age and seniors' motives for vacation travel, Social Indicators Research, 60, 1-3, pp. 227-241, (2002); Conde F., Marinas J.M., Las Representaciones Sociales Sobre La Salud De Los Mayores MadrilenOs [Social Representations Of Health Of Older People From Madrid, (1997); Cummins R.A., Moving from the quality of life concept to a theory, Journal of Intellectual Disability Research, 49, 10, pp. 699-706, (2005); Cutchin M.P., The process of mediated aging-inplace: A theoretically and empirically based model, Social Science Medicine, 57, pp. 1077-1090, (2003); Diener E., Assessing subjective well-being: Progress and opportunities, Social Indicators Research, 31, pp. 103-157, (1994); Farquhar M., Elderly people's definitions of quality of life, Social Science Medicine, 41, 10, pp. 1439-1446, (1995); Fassnacht C., Woods D., Transana V2.0X [Computer Software And Manual], (2005); Fernandez-Mayoralas G., Rojo Perez F., Calidad de vida y salud: Planteamientos conceptuales y metodos de investigacion [quality of life and health: Conceptual basis and research methods], Territoris, 5, pp. 117-135, (2005); Godfrey M., Townsend J., Older people in transition from illness to health: Trajectories of recovery, Qualitative Health Research, 18, pp. 939-951, (2008); Grewal I., Lewis J., Flynn T., Brown J., Bond J., Coast J., Developing attributes for a generic quality of life measure for older people: Preferences or capabilities?, Social Science Medicine, 62, 8, pp. 1891-1901, (2006); Hendry F., McVittie C., Is quality of life a healthy concept?

Access to health care has generally been treated as gender‐neutral in the medical geography literature. In this paper, access to a women's health care service is examined using a location‐allocation approach. We argue for the utility of a location‐allocation approach to the informed siting of breast‐screening facilities for two reasons. First, the readily available sex‐ and age‐specific data are truly representative of need for breast‐screening services. Second, there is a need to ensure geographic accessibility to women's health care services where the outcomes such as decreased mortality and improved quality of life have been demonstrated. A commonly used location‐allocation approach with distance constraints is employed to evaluate the service provided by mammography facilities in the Ontario Breast Screening Program Kingston Centre's catchment area. The existing catchment area is found to leave many women with impossibly long travel distances. The results demonstrate the importance of taking a gender‐informed geographic approach to the siting of women's health care services. Le bien‐être des femmes a été négligé dans le domaine de la géographie. L'accès á l'aide médicale a été, généralement, traité sans tenir compte du problème ‘sexe’ dans la littérature médico‐géographique. Dans cet écrit, l'accès des femmes á un service médical est analysé au moyen d'une approche qui tient compte de la disponibilité du corps médical sur l'ensemble de la région désservie. ll y a deux raisons pour lesquelles nous argumentons l'utilité des ‘médecins désignés’ concernant l'information distribuée sur les cliniques offrant, aux patientes, des examens amenant au dépistage du cancer du sein. Premièrement, les dernières statistiques disponibles sur le sexe et les âges spécifiques, montrent clairement la nécessité de services pour les examens mammaires. Deuxièmement, il est important de dèmontrer qu'il y a un besoin de réassurer l'accessibilité géographique au centre médical pour les femmes dans les cas où le taux de mortalité décroît ce qui amène, comme résultat, á une meilleure qualité de vie. Le service offert concernant la mammographie du ‘Programme Ontarien de Dépistage du Cancer du Sein’ au Centre Médical de Kingston est employé pour évaluer l'efficacité du corps médical malgré les problèmes de distances. Les régions désservies existantes ont malheureusement le désavantage d'être trop loin, ce qui ne favorise pas les patientes qui ne peuvent faire de longs voyages. Pour conclure, les rèsultats démontrent que l'approche géographique par le facteur de sexe dans la location des centres médicaux pour les femmes doit être, de préférence, revue.

Integrating research from two previous qualitative studies of formal and informal care provisioning in Ontario, Canada, the authors re-analyzed semi-structured interviews with 83 directors, managers, paid staff, volunteers and family members to examine the challenges they faced when providing care during the winter season. Similar to other settings where winter conditions like snow, ice and cold temperatures are commonplace, the studies were set within a health policy context in which there is not enough recognition of the difficulties of weather for coordinating, managing and providing care to disabled, injured, chronically ill and frail individuals. The re-analysis focused on how winter conditions translate into geographical, administrative, economic, operational, physical, social and psychological barriers within and across different 'scales of care'. The findings indicate that the problems posed by weather are crucial yet often underestimated aspects of home and community care provided by formal and informal caregivers. The analysis of weather-related challenges for care provisioning needs to be extended to other seasonal conditions (e.g., the challenges of delivering care in extreme heat), to the developing world and even to the burgeoning debates on the health implications of global environmental change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Spanish Time Use Survey (2002-2003) is used to examine: (1) the proportion of co-resident informal caregivers receiving paid and unpaid support by persons from outside the home; (2) the main factors associated with receipt of external paid and unpaid support; and, (3) factors linked to the amount of support received in terms of time. The study sample included 404 caregivers who cohabited with the person receiving care. We used a modified Andersen Behavioural Model as the analytic framework. Significant differences are observed in receipt of support according to predisposing, enabling and need factors. Overall, support (paid and unpaid) is significantly lower among households with women caregivers. In comparison with the least educated caregivers, higher levels of paid support are observed among those with secondary school or higher education, even when income, household size and receiver's age are included in the model. After controlling for care receivers' disability level and age, unpaid support is significantly higher among employed caregivers, spouses and caregivers living in medium-sized cities, versus unemployed caregivers, other relatives and caregivers living in large cities, respectively. These data highlight the inequalities of resources in terms of caregiver gender, socio-economic status and population size. The findings underscore the need to extend analysis not only to primary caregivers, but to caregiving networks and other types of caregiver support as well. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Help; Informal care; Older people; Paid carers; Spain; Support","","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (CSO2008-04747)","Two types of external support provided to households of co-resident informal caregivers were chosen as dependent variables: paid support and unpaid support.

It focuses on Mainland Chinese (MLC) immigrants - the most important source of immigrants to Canada since 1996 - in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), Canada. Specifically, the paper aims to explore the choice between Chinese-speaking and non-Chinese-speaking family physicians by MLC immigrants and to determine the underlying reasons for MLC immigrants use of ethnically- and linguistically-matched family physicians. A wide range of data are analyzed including survey and focus group data, physician data from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) and geo-referenced 2001 Canadian Census data. A mixed-method approach is employed combining quantitative analysis of survey data and Census data, spatial analysis of patient travel behaviour based on the survey and qualitative analysis based on focus groups. The paper reveals an overwhelming preference among MLC survey respondents for Chinese-speaking family physicians regardless of study areas and socioeconomic and demographic status. The focus groups suggest that language, culture and ethnicity are intertwined in a complex way to influence the choice of health care providers and health management strategies in the host society. The paper yields important policy implications for identifying health professional shortage areas for culturally-diverse populations, addressing issues related to foreign-trained physicians and enhancing primary care delivery relevant for immigrant populations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Individual experiences of aging are very different in urban and rural environments. The characteristics of population aging are also sensitive to the significant variations in the landscape of economic opportunity arising from the fact that thriving local economies both attract and retain younger individuals at a higher rate than the elderly. The ensuing discussion explores the nature of both social and geographic diversity among the elderly, with particular emphasis on emerging trends and issues for the future.","","Canada; aging population; demographic trend; elderly population","","","","","","","Barer M.L., Evans R.G., Hertzman C., Lomas I., Aging and health care utilization.

R7A 6A9, Canada","Over the past 15 years, OECD countries have come to recognise that their elderly populations are already, or will be, the fastest growing segments of their populations in the coming decades. In recognition of these demographic facts, public and private sectors planners with responsibility for housing, health and social services and transportation have divided into two camps. In one camp are those who believe that the full integration of the elderly population within their communities is the best way to insure the maximum life satisfaction of the elderly population over the longest period of time. This view manifests itself in proposals to allow 'in-law suites' to be built in areas zoned for single-family dwellings, deinstitutionalisation and concomitant development of community-based care, and public transit systems made fully accessible to seniors regardless of their level of physical ability. In the other camp are those who believe that the elderly population wants and seeks a built environment which specifically caters for their particular needs. The most visible manifestations of this perspective are the 'seniors only communities' with their separate health and social services, and transportation systems. This paper focuses on integration versus segregation in planning housing, health and social services and transportation for seniors over the past 15 years (1986-2000). We emphasise that the planning outcomes of integrated-based and segregated-based solutions need to be understood within the broader socio-economic and legal contexts in which planning takes place. Underlying the integration-segregation dichotomy is the broader theoretical dichotomy of equity-efficiency. We have divided our paper into the main chapters. In the introductory chapter, the themes of integrated-based planning and segregated-based planning are explained. In addition, the current size and the future growth of elderly populations in OECD countries are reviewed. Chapter 2 focuses on housing. Chapter 3 examines the literature on health and social services and transportation. We conclude with an assessment of the implications of integrated-based and segregation-based planning for elderly populations in the next century. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd All rights reserved.","","aging population; elderly population; OECD; social policy","","","","","","","APTA Survey, (2000); Aronson J., Old women's experiences of needing care: Choice or compulsion?, Canadian Journal on Aging, 9, pp. 234-247, (1990); Applebaum R., Phillips P., Assuring the quality of in-home care: The 'other' challenge for long-term care, The Gerontologist, 30, pp. 444-450, (1990); Baldock J., Evers A., Innovations and care of the elderly: The cutting-edge of change for social welfare systems.

Understanding spatial accessibility to residential care resources by older people supports the need for rational allocation of care resources in future planning.Methods: Based on population data and data on residential care resources, this study uses two Geographic Information System (GIS) based methods - shortest path analysis and a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method to analyse spatial accessibility to residential care resources.Results: Spatial accessibility varies as the methods and considered factors change. When only time distance is considered, residential care resources are more accessible in the central city than in suburban and exurban areas. If care resources are considered in addition to time distance, spatial accessibility is relatively poor in the central city compared to the northeast to southeast side of the suburban and exurban areas. The resources in the northwest to southwest side of the city are the least accessible, even though several hotspots of residential care resources are located in these areas.Conclusions: For policy making, it may require combining various methods for a comprehensive analysis. The methods used in this study provide tools for identifying underserved areas in order to improve equity in access to and efficiency in allocation of residential care resources in future planning. © 2012 Cheng et al.;

First, there are the connections between research topics although the political and socio-economic realities of the various geographical contexts can lead to foci on different aspects and social and geographic processes. There are then the connections between researchers from developed and developing countries who share an interest in the geography of health and health care, who perhaps transfer or refine research methods to look at the different contexts and even different topics. Finally, in this context, there are the connections between researchers and the IGU Commission on Health, Environment and Development (HED) promoted by the HED for the past eight years through its activities. This paper uses examples from the literature and the activities of HED to illustrate these various connections. It argues that if the geography of health and health care is to continue to develop, these three sets of connections must continue to grow and strengthen.","Ageing; Health; Health care research; Infectious diseases; Third World","Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Geographical regions; Health; developing world; geographical research; health care; health status; medical geography; Refine research methods; Health care","","","","","European Net-; UNEP; United Nations Environmental Programme; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Funding text 1: The CHED has from the outset had the conscious strategy to involve a wide range of those in the research and policy communities in developed and developing countries. Indeed, the Commission was attached to a World Health Organization collaborating centre for Spatial Health Modelling, between 1995 and 2000 (a joint WHO centre, comprising the Geografisch Instituut of the Vrije Universiteit of Brussels, Belgium, and the Health Research Group of the Department of Geography, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom). From these collaborations, at least two important publications appeared under the auspices of the WHO: a World atlas of ageing (Verhasselt, 1998) and a review of Spatial health research in Africa (Phillips and Andrews, 1999). The atlas on ageing was produced for the WHO Kobe Centre for Health and Development and was a notable geographical contribution to the UN International Year of Older Persons (IYOP). The Commission has also directly and indirectly been involved in a number of UN events. Recent examples include the WHO meeting on ‘Ageing and health: a global challenge for the 21st Century’, held in Kobe, Japan, in November 1998; the Asia-Pacific regional review of the IYOP held in Macau in late October 1999 (ESCAP, 1999) and a UN Expert Group on Ageing in Developed and Developing countries held in Addis Ababa in May 2000. Many Commission members have been representatives on national and international panels and committees on health, environment and development. This aspect of CHED connections has been most fruitful and stimulating as well as heightening the profile of research applications in the geography of health. Many CHED events and symposia have received support and sometimes co-sponsorship from international organizations that have sent representatives to attend meetings and to contribute to the scientific debate. Specific examples in recent years include: • ‘Environment, life elements and health-longevity’, Bei-jing, May 1996, was co-sponsored by the Chinese Acad-emy of Sciences, the UNEP Register of Potentially Toxic Chemicals, the WHO/UNEP/ILO Programme on Chem-ical Safety and the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Epidemiology of Rheumatic Diseases. A number of na-tional academies including those of China and Norway were also involved. • ‘Changing patterns of health in developing countries’, Vadodara, India, Jan. 1998, was co-sponsored by a number of Indian organizations and several international organizations, including the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) and the Ford Foundation. • ‘Health and health care in transition’, Coimbra, Portugal, August 1998, was co-sponsored by a number of re-gional and national organizations in Portugal, including an institute of the Ministry of Health. • ‘Setting an Agenda for Research on Health and the Environment, 1999–2000,’ was co-sponsored by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). In addition, individual workshops received support from other regional and international agencies both financially and with respect to their partic-ipation as presenters. For example, the workshop in the Netherlands received funding from the European Net-; Funding text 2: 1This section is adapted from Rosenberg and Jäger (2000). 2Additional funding was received from the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).","Akhtar R., Urban health hazards in Srinagar, India, pp. 71-81, (1995); Akinkugbe O.O., Lifestyle and cardiovascular diseases: Emerging problems of health development in the Third World, pp. 177-183, (1995); Asthana S., Economic crisis, adjustment and the impact on health, pp. 50-64, (1994); Asthana S., Curtis S., Duncan C., Gould M., Healthy diversity or academic chaos?

Lost within this debate has been the unprecedented explosion of research by medical and health geographers. Using this debate as a fulcrum, research in medical and health geography is reviewed, and opportunities where medical, health and population geographers might usefully collaborate are identified. Ultimately, medical, health and population geographers need to work toward creating inclusive geographies.; While medical geography has grown eclectic to the point where a growing number of medical geographers prefer the terms health geographer, health geography, or the geography of health, schisms have nonetheless developed between Mayer et al. and those who have urged medical geographers to seek new epistemologies. Lost in this debate is the rapid and considerable growth of research by medical and health geographers. The author first reviews recent research on the mapping and modeling of diseases, then examines the literature on the access, delivery, and planning of health services. He then considers the debate over medical geography versus a geography of health. Opportunities are identified where medical, health, and population geographers can productively collaborate. Sharing many of the same theoretical and methodological strengths, weaknesses, and frustrations, medical, health, and population geographers need to work together toward creating inclusive geographies.","","Delivery of Health Care; Disease; Geography; Health; Health Services; Population; Social Sciences; Delivery Of Health Care; Diseases; Geography; Health; Health Services; Human Geography; Literature Review; Population; Social Sciences; geographical research; health geography; medical geography; article; Diseases; general aspects of disease; geography; health; health care delivery; health service; Human Geography; Literature Review; population; sociology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10773495","","","12321831","English","Int.

Indeed, a mix of individual, community, political, social, economic, cultural and geographical factors determines vulnerability. These factors are not uniform across a region or nation; rather, there are geographic, demographic and socioeconomic differences.

In part, this debate is a policy tug-of-war among provincial governments, special interest groups and the public who on one side want to maintain the principles of the health care system and on the other want to control costs within the system. The outcome of this policy tug-of-war is demonstrated through an analysis of the funding of health care in the province of Ontario, Canada in general, and the closure of hospital beds specifically. The analysis shows that in attempting to restructure the system, rationalization and growing spatial inequality are occurring simultaneously. The analysis calls into question the whole strategy of bed closures as a method of controlling health care costs. These conclusions have implications for other national health care systems where hospital bed closures have also been used as a strategy in controlling health care costs. © 1994.","Canada; hospitals; restructuring","Aged; Canada; Cost Control; Forecasting; Health Care Costs; Health Services for the Aged; Hospital Restructuring; Human; National Health Programs; Ontario; Population Growth; Canada, Ontario; bed closure; cost control; health care; policy change; social policy; canada; cost control; government; health care cost; health care financing; health care policy; health care system; hospital bed; human; review","","","","","","","Evans, Et al., Controlling health expenditures—the Canadian reality, N.

Against this back-drop, a hierarchical model of migration for immigrant groups for the period 1981-86 is developed and estimated. The internal redistribution of immigrants through post-arrival migration has continued to be focused on metropolitan areas in general and on Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal in particular. The distribution of previous immigrants plays a significant role over and above that of economic circumstances both in retaining immigrants in a particular city and in attracting members of immigrant groups from other cities. -from Authors","","Americas; Canada; Demography; Developed Countries; Economics; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; Models, Theoretical; North America; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Residential Mobility; Transients and Migrants; Canada; Montreal; Toronto; Vancouver; Americas; Canada; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Economic Factors; Geographic Factors; Immigrants; Migrants; Migration; Migration, Internal; Models, Theoretical; North America; Northern America; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Spatial Distribution; spatial distribution; hierarchical migration model; immigrant group; migration pattern; regional distribution; article; Canada; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Economic Factors; economics; Geographic Factors; geography; Immigrants; Migrants; migration; Migration, Internal; North America; Northern America; population; population dynamics; research; Research Methodology; theoretical model; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12290048","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029416642"

Using data from the 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) and the 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), this article examines differences in health status and the determinants of health and health care use between the 55-and-older Aboriginal population and non-Aboriginal population. The results show that the older Aboriginal population is unhealthier than the non-Aboriginal population across all age groups; differences in health status, however, appear to converge as age increases. Among those aged 55 to 64, 7 per cent of the Aboriginal population report three or more chronic conditions compared with 2 per cent of the non-Aboriginal population. Yet, among those aged 75 and older, 51 per cent of the Aboriginal population report three or more chronic conditions in comparison with 23 per cent of the non-Aboriginal population. © 2010 Canadian Association on Gerontology.","Aboriginal people; health care use; health status","Age Factors; Aged; Aging; Alcoholism; Canada; Chronic Disease; Continental Population Groups; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Indians, North American; Inuits; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Smoking; age; aged; aging; alcoholism; American Indian; article; Canada; chronic disease; comparative study; Eskimo; ethnology; female; health care disparity; health status; health survey; human; life expectancy; male; middle aged; poverty; questionnaire; race; risk factor; smoking; statistics","","","","","","","Aldrich J.H., Nelson F.D., Linear Probability, Logit, and Probit Models, (1984); First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey (RHS), (2009); Beland Y., Canadian community health survey-Methodological overview, Health Reports, 13, 3, pp. 9-14, (2001); Buchignani N., Armstrong-Esther C., Informal care and older Native Canadians, Ageing and Society, 19, 1, pp. 3-32, (1999); Cattarinich X., Gibson N., Cave A.J., Assessing mental capacity in Canadian Aboriginal seniors, Social Science and Medicine, 53, 11, pp. 1469-1479, (2001); Chandola T., Jenkinson C., Validating self-rated health in different ethnic groups, Ethnicity and Health, 5, 2, pp. 151-159, (2000); Cleary P.D., Jette A.M., The validity of self-reported physician utilization measures, Medical Care, 22, pp. 796-803, (1984); Coleman H., Grant C., Collins J., Inhalant use by Canadian Aboriginal youth, Journal of Child and Adolescent Substance Abuse, 10, 3, pp. 1-20, (2001); Collings P., If you got everything, it's good enough"": Perspectives on successful aging in a Canadian Inuit community, Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology, 16, 2, pp. 127-155, (2001); Crosato K.E., Ward-Griffin C., Leipert B., Aboriginal women caregivers of the elderly in geographically isolated communities, Rural and Remote Health, 7, (2007); Edge L., McCallum T., Métis identity: Sharing traditional knowledge and healing practices at Métis elders' gatherings, Pimatisiwin: A Journal of Aboriginal and Indigenous Community Health, 4, 2, pp. 83-115, (2006); Fuller-Thomson E., Canadian first nations grandparents raising grandchildren: A portrait in resilience, International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 60, 4, pp. 331-342, (2005); A Statistical Profile on the Health of the First Nations in Canada, (2003); Hernandez-Quevedo C., Jones A.M., Rice N., Reporting Bias and Heterogeneity in Self-assessed Health.

Databases which contain utilization data rarely allow for the modelling of geographic variation. In the Ontario Health Survey (OHS), individual observations are georeferenced at the Public Health Unit (PHU) scale, but PHUs cannot easily be used because of the large coefficients of variation. To overcome this problem, a cluster analysis is performed to create a service environment variable, which reflects differences in service availability, population size and rurality. Utilization of health services is then modelled as a logistic regression equation where the independent variables are age, sex, service environment and income to test the Birch and Abelson argument. This argument is then extended by controlling for age, health and income status. Based on the modelling results, the importance of geography to access and utilization is assessed.","Access; Health services; Utilization","Canada, Ontario; geography role; health care planning; health service provision; modelling approach; Ontario Health Survey; public health unit; service utilisation; article; Canada; cluster analysis; data base; geographic distribution; health care utilization; health survey; human; income; population; rural area; social status","","","","","","","Birch S., Abelson J., Is reasonable access what we want?

Presented are age- and sex-specific prevalence of chronic conditions and logistic regression is used to assess the impacts of different chronic conditions on the receipt of help for IADL and ADL. The importance of gender and living alone in influencing the receipt of help and also of use of formal agencies is presented using additional data from HALS. Findings from these analyses are also used to project changes in the distribution of health status defined by disability and receipt of help with IADL/ADL and, secondarily, by chronic condition. These analyses imply increases in demand for a range of health related services which will be 50 to 100% greater than the growth in the total elderly population.","","Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Canada; Chronic Disease; Disabled Persons; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Health Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Prevalence; Social Support; adult; aged; aging; article; Canada; chronic disease; daily life activity; female; gender; health status; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; regression analysis","","","","","Social Sciencesand Humanities Research Council; Statistics Canada","The research reported here was supported by Statistics Canada and the Social Sciencesand Humanities Research Council, whose assincesta is gratefully acknowledged.","Caring for Frail Elderly People: Policies in Evolution, (1996); Foot D., Boom, Bust and Echo: How to Profit from the Coming Demographic Shift, (1996); Romaniuc A., Fertility in Canada: Retrospective and prospective, Perspectives on Canada's Population: An Introduction to Concepts and Issues, (1994); Moore E.G., Rosenberg M.W., Growing Old in Canada: Demographic and Geographic Perspectives (Statistics Canada Census Monograph Series), (1997); International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps: A Manual of Classification Relating to the Consequences of Disease, (1980); Chen J.G., Verma R., George M.V., Projections of Persons with Disability at Work: Canada, Provinces and Territories, 1991-2016, (1993); Wilkins R., The need for population-based data on disability, Proceedings of a Workshop: Measuring the Health of Canadians Using Population Surveys, pp. 89-94, (1991); Omran A., The epidemiological transition: A theory of the epidemiology of population change, Milbank Quarterly, 64, pp. 355-391, (1971); Powles J., Changes in disease patterns and related social trends, Social Science and Medicine, 35, pp. 613-617, (1992); Wilkins K., Park E., Chronic conditions, physical limitations and dependency among seniors living in the community, Health Reports, 8, pp. 7-16, (1996); Rosenthal C., Gladstone J., Family relationships and support in later life, Aging: Canadian Perspectives, (1994); Ross N.A., Rosenberg M.W., Pross D.C., Siting a women's health facility: A location-allocation study of breast cancer screening services in eastern Ontario, The Canadian Geographer, 38, pp. 150-161, (1994); Ross N.A., Rosenberg M.W., Pross D.C., Bass B., Contradictions in women's health care provision: A case study of attendance for breast screening, Social Science and Medicine, 39, pp. 1015-1025, (1994); Population Projections 1993-2041, Canada, Provinces and Territories, (1994); Women D.M., Children and poverty in Canada, Canadian Public Policy, 20, pp. 430-443, (1994)","E.G.

We critically examine NPM in the context of recent public sector restructuring initiatives in the province of Ontario, Canada. Two NPM-inspired reform mechanisms employed by the Ontario government - the benchmarking of hospital-utilization indicators and the offloading of a greater share of patient-care responsibilities to the private sector - are examined as they impact on the economically disadvantaged city of Thunder Bay in the province's remote Northwestern region. We argue that the health reforms pursued by the Ontario Government are focused on a one-dimensional notion of efficiency which denies important socioeconomic and health-service-environment dimensions that account for local differences in health-services utilization. Although this type of reform approach achieves short-term cost savings, we question whether the longer term effects on health and social services are efficient and equitable from a systemwide perspective. Ultimately, we question whether NPM will solve the problems inherent in publicly supported health and social services or will generate a new set of problems linked to the belief in the primacy of market mechanisms.","","Canada; Ontario; health care; health services; public administration; public sector","","","","","","","Aucoin P., Administrative reform in public management: Paradigms, principles, paradoxes and pendulums, Governance, 3, pp. 115-137, (1990); Aucoin P., The New Public Management: Canada in Comparative Perspective, (1995); Bruder K.A., Gray E.M., Public-sector benchmarking: Apractical approach, Public Management, 76, 9, (1994); Wilson M., Remarks by the Honourable Jim Wilson, Minister of Health, Re: Thunder Bay Restructuring, (1996)","","","Pion Limited","","","","","","0263774X","","","","English","Environ.

A secondary issue is that the data sets which contain detailed data on health status and environmental variables often contain only limited data on housing. Similarly, housing surveys rarely contain detailed data on health and environmental variables. Respondents from Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the public use micro-data files of the 1996/97 cycle of the National Population Health Survey make up the data sets for a series of logistic regression models where health status, allergies, asthma, arthritis, migraines and bronchitis/emphysema act as the dependent variables. Sets of variables which measure housing, the environment (smoking and alcohol consumption) and the socio-economic status of individuals are used as independent variables. The issues of confounders and the limitations of the data are illustrated by the results of the analysis. If we are to go beyond local area surveys and carry out broader analyses of the links between health status and the quality of housing, researchers and data collection agencies will need to re-think the artificial divisions between these two critical aspects of peoples' lives.","Health; Housing; Population health surveys","Canada; Allergies; Data acquisition; Health; Housing; Surveys; health status; housing conditions; medical geography; methodology; Confounders; Geology","","","","","","","Ahlbom A., Day N., Feychting M., Roman E., Skinner J., Dockerty J., Linet M., McBride M., Michaelis J., Olsen J.H., Tynes T., Verkasalo P.K., A pooled analysis of magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia, Brit.

K7L 3N6, Canada; Bass B., Ontario Breast Screening Program Kingston Centre, Kingston, Ont., Canada","Breast cancer screening facilities operated by the Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) have recently been added to the existing geography of diagnostic mammography facilities in hospitals and private clinics in Eastern Ontario. While diagnostic facilities require a physician's referral for access, the new centres offer mammograms by self-referral. Other work has shown the utilization of mammography screening services to be quite low despite widespread acceptance of early diagnosis through mammographic screening as the best method to lower breast cancer mortality. Major findings are that spatial variation does exist in attendance rates in the townships and census tracts surrounding the screening centre. At the regional level, physician referral patterns and the presence of local diagnostic mammography units appear to affect the uptake of screening at the Kingston facility. The individual level analysis confirms the importance of the primary care physician's referral with two-thirds of the client sample indicating that they were referred for screening by their family physician. The sample of clients are also very mobile women who have comparatively greater access to financial resources than other women of screening age. The results of ecological and individual level analyses of attendance at OBSP's Kingston Centre reveal contradictions in the provision of this service. Spatially, the centres follow a location pattern of a much higher order health facility yet women are expected to include screening as part of their routine care. Attenders at the Centre were found to be of higher socioeconomic status, married and have access to a private automobile. The finding that the primary care physician's referral is an important prerequisite for attendance raises questions about the feasibility of providing health care for women which encourages individual responsibility for health within the existing paternalistic health care system. © 1994.","Kingston; mammography; mobility; Ontario; utilization; women's health","Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Human; Mammography; Mass Screening; Middle Age; Ontario; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Referral and Consultation; Socioeconomic Factors; Women's Health; adult; aged; article; breast cancer; canada; cancer mortality; cancer screening; car; early diagnosis; female; general practitioner; health care utilization; human; human experiment; mammography; marriage; normal human; patient referral; primary health care; social status","","","","","","","Bastani, Marcus, Hollatz-Brown, Screening mammography rates and barriers to use: a Los Angeles country survey, Prevent.
