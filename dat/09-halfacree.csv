Obtaining functional and inclusive societal organisation is not a simple matter of 'doing it' by subscribing to winning formulae as there are, for example, many choices to be made in the process. Moreover, given that conceptual frameworks always guide thoughts, judgments and actions, how we relate to 'sustainability' specifically becomes relevant if we aim to achieve a more liveable society. This journal issue expressly engages with the consequent need to recognise this complexity. It assembles a set of 'brave' takes on far-advanced problems bedevilling conventionally conceptualised paths towards sustainability. Arguing against oversimplification that comes from domination of polarising concepts and unquestioned practices and rhetorics, the aim is to foster explorations into new territories from which we may learn. Ultimately, the desire to deconstruct pernicious divisions and create new hybrid syntheses can progress sustainability. © 2018 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

This agenda encompasses several dimensions, one being the socio-economic dimension of urbanisation, including urban-rural development, public transport, migration and food systems in urban-rural context. The centre’s research methodology is based on knowledge co-creation and co-production, where researchers (not only academic), practitioners, citizens, civil society, the public sector and business jointly identify societal challenges, design projects, and implement solutions.","Adams W., Sustainability, Introducing Human Geographies, 2nd Edition, pp. 285-297, (2005); Al-Husban M., Adams C., Sustainable refugee migration: A rethink towards a positive capability approach, Sustainability, 8, 5, pp. 451-460, (2016); Anderson C.A., Belief Perseverance, Encyclopedia of Social Psychology, pp. 109-110, (2007); Anthias F., Pajnik M., Contesting Integration, Engendering Migration: Theory and Practice, (2014); Arsovski S., Kwiatkowski M., Lewandowska A., Jordanova Peshevska D., Sofeska E., Dymitrow M., Can urban environmental problems be overcome? the case of Skopje-world's most polluted city, Bulletin of Geography.

One factor that has not been fully considered is the role of children. Heterosexual couples may be more likely to migrate in favour of the male 'breadwinner's' career if the couple have children, or are planning to commence childrearing in the foreseeable future. However, little work seems to have examined this empirically. The authors focus on the influence of 'motherhood' in different national contexts, using comparable census microdata for Great Britain and the United States. They test whether apparent 'tied migration' effects may in fact be influenced by family decisions related to childbearing/childrearing, and two sets of modelling results are provided. First, they examine whether the effects of long-distance family migration on women's labour-market status is influenced by the presence or absence of children of different ages. Second, they conduct the same analysis for women who have a high-status occupation. The results demonstrate that women in families with young children are most likely to be out of employment after family migration. A smaller, but similar, tied-migration effect exists for families with older children and families with no children. The same pattern exists for women in high-status occupations. Tied migration appears to influence women's labour-market status equally in Great Britain and the United States, regardless of the presence or absence of children.","","Eurasia; Europe; North America; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe; gender role; labor market; labor participation; migration; womens employment","","","","","","","Bailey A.J., Cooke T.J., Family migration and employment: The importance of migration history and gender, International Regional Science Review, 21, pp. 99-118, (1998); Berger B., Berger P., The War Over the Family: Capturing the Middle Ground, (1983); Bielby W.T., Bielby D.D., I will follow him: Family ties, gender-role beliefs, and reluctance to relocate for a better job, American Journal of Sociology, 97, pp. 1241-1267, (1992); Blaisure K.R., Allen K.R., Feminists and the ideology and practice of marital quality, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 57, pp. 5-19, (1995); Bonney N., Love J., Gender and migration: Geographical mobility and the wife's sacrifice, The Sociological Review, 39, pp. 335-348, (1991); Boyle P.J., Cooke T., Halfacree K.H., Smith D., Integrating GB and US census microdata for studying the impact of family migration on partnered women's labour market status, International Journal of Population Geography, 5, pp. 157-178, (1999); Boyle P.J., Cooke T., Halfacree K.H., Smith D., Gender inequality in employment status following family migration in GB and the US: The effect of relative occupational status, International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy, 19, pp. 115-150, (1999); Boyle P.J., Cooke T., Halfacree K.H., Smith D., A cross-national comparison of the impact of family integration on women's employment status, Demography, 38, pp. 201-213, (2001); Boyle P.J., Cooke T., Halfacree K.H., Smith D., A cross-national comparison of the effects of family migration on women's labour market status: Some difficulties with integrating microdata from two censuses, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A (Statistics in Society), 165, pp. 465-480, (2002); Brannen J., Childbirth and occupational mobility: Evidence from a longitudinal study, Work, Employment and Society, 3, pp. 179-201, (1989); Carrier S., Family status and career situation for professional women, Work, Employment and Society, 9, pp. 343-358, (1995); Christy S., Women, work, and the workplace, Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective, pp. 179-203, (1990); Clarke W.A.V., Withers S., Disentangling the interaction of migration, mobility, and labor-force participation, Environment and Planning A, 34, pp. 923-945, (2002); Cooke T.J., Trailing wife' or 'trailing mother'?

The paper argues that this link was very fecund for many within the broad UK ‘folk music’ community specifically. After introducing COVID-19's pro-rural turn, the paper gives a brief overview of now substantial music geography scholarship, paying particular attention to what has been studied in respect of folk music, not least its examination of the latter's problematic links to English identities. It argues that folk music's resurgent rural links call for attention. It then introduces how the rural-folk music COVID-19 experience worked at three non-exclusive levels. First, there was rural influence on the music being produced. Second, some musicians were also personally impacted strongly by rural experiences, evident not solely through their music. Third, some musicians developed original rural initiatives that saw audience members also gaining direct rural inspiration, not just via the strong growth in internet-facilitated connections but through direct in-place encounters with the musicians in the rural. Each reading is illustrated by two brief case studies, with the rural-folk combination becoming increasingly alive and more-than-representational. It is suggested in conclusion that there remains a strong ‘life’ to these rural-folk music connections in less predominant COVID-19 times. © 2024 The Author(s).

This paper introduces all three of these after setting the scene prior to the 2016 Brexit vote by first summarising the seeming shift across rural Britain from productivism to post-productivism in the years after 1945. Each of the three sources of rural disruption are then described, but also argued to be building what is termed a ‘revanchist rural’. This development seeks to challenge many of the post-productivist attempts to diversify the countryside by restating a narrower conservative ‘traditional’ rural geography. It is also a rural vision largely in opposition to Mark Shucksmith's utopian Good Countryside, introduced in the final section. However, a revanchist rural is not the only option for the British countryside in 2023 and the paper goes on to note a broader revival of debate and interest in the rural in recent years. This has let loose a variety of currents, briefly noted, more in tune with the Good Countryside, such that the future for rural Britain in 2023, it is concluded, is very much still there for the making.

We argue that, while such research is to be encouraged, there are problems in integrating different data-sets that must be given due attention. The example considered here is a cross-national analysis of the effects of family migration on labour market participation rates for female partners using data from the 1991 British Census Sample of Anonymised Records and the 1990 United States Public Use Microdata Sample. However, the lessons from this exercise are argued to be of more general interest. The problems we address are divided into those of: data collection, manipulation and reliability; question type and definition; and the measurement of individual and family variables. We also present some brief empirical findings from our two samples. The paper demonstrates that care must be taken when comparing microdata across nations, and that in some ways the GB and US data are surprisingly incompatible. Even so, the benefits of cross-national comparisons make endeavours such as this well worthwhile, enabling comparative benchmarks to be established from which the influence of national ideological and institutional structures can be evaluated.; This paper investigates the problems in integrating different data sets for social science research. A cross-national analysis of the effects of family migration on labor market participation rates for female partners was used as an example to concretize these problems. The data used in the cross national analysis came from the 1991 British Census Sample of Anonymised Records and the 1990 United States Public Use Microdata Sample. The problems addressed were the following: data collection; manipulation and reliability; question type and definition; and measurement of individual and family variables. As part of the analysis, some empirical findings were also presented. Significant overall differences between the US and Great Britain (GB) samples were observed, particularly concerning graduate qualifications, marital and employment status, and ethnic group. There were higher numbers of married partners and full-time workers in the US sample, while female partners undertaking part-time employment were greater in GB. Furthermore, the US sample had more couples with a female graduate as compared with the GB sample who had a higher proportion of nongraduate couples. Finally, this paper recognized the importance of cross- national research in the evaluation of national ideological and institutional structures.","Census microdata; Family migration; Female labour market participation; Great Britain; United States","United Kingdom; United States; labor market; methodology; migration; womens status","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","10773495","","","12295271","English","Int.

Whilst the considerable work done in this area to date is not erroneous, its foci have been too narrowly specified and delineated. The predominant framing of migration in general as an immediate, instrumental, bounded action is first presented. This is then deconstructed to arrive at the proposition of migration as a longitudinal, elusive and incomplete event. Such a framing also requires us to acknowledge migration as lived more-than-representationally. The conceptual argument is then illustrated using counterurban migration, first introducing supporting sources of evidence for taking this different perspective and then extracting five key themes regarding the impact of the more-than-representational, notably rural affect, on in-migrants. The chapter concludes by arguing for the active rural voice revealed here to be recognised within the shaping of any rural future. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Anthropological Work; Corporeal Travel; Human Migration; Incomplete Event; Social Scientific Scholarship","","","","","","","","Anderson B., Harrison P., The promise of non-representational theories, Taking-Place: Non-Representational Theories and Geography, pp. 1-34, (2010); Bauman Z., Liquid Modernity, (2000); Bell D., Variations on the rural idyll, Handbook of Rural Studies, pp. 149-160, (2006); Benson M., A desire for difference: British lifestyle migration to southwest France, Lifestyle Migration: Expectations, Aspirations and Experiences, pp. 121-136, (2009); Benson M., The British in Rural France, (2011); Benson M., O'Reilly K., Migration and the search for a better way of life: A critical exploration of lifestyle migration, The Sociological Review, 57, pp. 608-625, (2009); Blackman L., Venn C., Affect, Body and Society, 16, pp. 7-28, (2010); Blythe R., Akenfield, (1969); Bowler I., Some consequences of the industrialisation of agriculture in the European Community, The Industrialisation of the Countryside, pp. 75-98, (1985); Migration into Rural Areas.

Drawing primarily on material concerned with internal migrationwithin the so-called developed world, attention is given to the enculturation of both migration theory and research as an entry point to work on this non-economic dimension. From this springboard, the paper focuses on three lessons that can be learnt from ongoing research into migration 'beyond' the economic. Firstly, it notes a danger that this work assumes something of a separate and, arguably, subordinate status to that still being done on the crucial economic dimensions of migration. Secondly, and this time more positively, this non-economic work challenges the existence of any economic reductionism within our understanding of migration. Thirdly, and most controversially, it is suggested that the non-economic worlds of migration revealed through a culturally-aware lens can facilitate the glimpsing of a more utopic imagination, critiquing key elements of our dominant socio-economic and cultural institutionalised practices. Work on counterurbanisation and gendered tied migration is used to illustrate these three lessons. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Critical theory; Culture; Migration; Non-economic; Utopia","decision making; migration determinant; theoretical study","","","","","","","Ambrose D., Welcome to Beyond the Border 2002, (2002); Baeten G., The spaces of utopia and dystopia: An introduction, Geografiska Annaler, 84, pp. 141-142, (2002); Beck U., Beck-Gernsheim E., The Normal Chaos of Love, (1995); Beck-Gernsheim E., Reinventing the Family, (2002); Becker P., Moen P., Scaling-back: Dual-earner couples' work-family strategies, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 61, pp. 995-1007, (1999); Berry B., The counterurbanization process: Urban America since 1970, Urbanization and Counterurbanization, pp. 17-30, (1976); Bhabha H., The Location of Culture, (1994); Bonney N., Love J., Gender and migration: Geographical mobility and the wife's sacrifice, Sociological Review, 39, pp. 335-348, (1991); Bonney N., McCleery A., Forster E., Migration, marriage and the life course: Commitment and residential mobility, Migration and Gender in the Developed World, pp. 136-150, (1999); Bourdieu P., Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, (1984); Bourdieu P., In Other Words: Essays Towards a Reflexive Sociology, (1990); Bourdieu P., Acts of Resistance.

Furthermore, rural development policies and programmes at EU and national levels have been critical in shaping the responses of different rural areas across Europe to these wider processes of restructuring. Contrasting empirical studies of ten European countries, this volume provides a comprehensive analysis of the restructuring processes and the various national, regional and local rural development programmes. Adopting a different national perspective in each chapter, it focuses particularly on issues of power and leadership in the evolution and administration of these programmes. Five broad issues are examined in each case: socio-economic changes in rural areas, the administrative context in which rural development and political activities take place, the sociological context, the political control of rural development, and the use of different discourses of rurality in shaping the development process. © Keith Halfacree, lmre Kovach and Rachel Woodward 2002.

These gaps need filling in order to appreciate the full flowering of the phenomenon in specific social-cultural, geographical and historical contexts; to enable comparison between these diverse expressions; and to examine their relationships with contemporaneous rural socio- cultural restructuring. One neglected element is counterurbanisation fairly directly informed by the late 1960s/1970s counterculture, a migration strand quickly stereotyped as the 'hippie' 'getting her/his head together in the countryside'. This paper uses the example of British singer-songwriter Vashti Bunyan, notably through the gestation and content of her Just Another Diamond Day album of 1970, to illustrate and examine countercultural counterurbanisation. With an additional nod to affective aspects of rurality, it also suggests something of what the lengthy rural journey Bunyan made from London to the Scottish islands, a key inspiration for the 1970 album, provided for her at a difficult, challenging, yet ultimately rewarding period in her life. Indeed, her experiences of (trying to engage with) the countryside on this journey are described as heterotopic, an association which leads the paper to suggest a more general heterotopic status for rurality within counterurbanisation. © 2009 Taylor &Francis.","Back-to-the-land; Counter-culture; Counterurbanisation; Heterotopia; Rurality; Vashti Bunyan","England; Eurasia; Europe; London [England]; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Phengodidae; counterurbanization; literature review","","","","","","","Barrell J., The Dark Side of the Landscape: The Rural Poor in English Painting 1730-1840, (1980); Interview with Vashti Bunyan, (2007); Berger B., The Survival of a Counterculture, (1981); Bolton N., Chalkley B., Counter-urbanis- ation-disposing of the myths, Town and Country Planning, 58, pp. 249-250, (1989); Boyd J., (1960); Migration into Rural Areas.

This article analyses some of these data for England over the 1979-94 period. Overall, against an upward trend in the numbers of Gypsy caravans, there has been a decline in caravans counted on unauthorised sites and a growth in those counted on private and local authority sites. However, this general picture hides a considerable degree of variation in the experience of Gypsies at the county level. Moreover, given this variation, it is suggested that measures concerned with Gypsies and trespass in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 will have a correspondingly uneven impact on the Gypsy population.","","UK, England; UK, Wales; caravan count; Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (1994); gypsy population; population distribution","","","","","","","Gypsy Sites Policy and Illegal Camping: Reform of the Caravan Sites Act 1968, (1992); Green H., Counting Gypsies, (1991); Hawes D., Perez B., The Gypsy and the State, (1995); Hawes D., Gypsy site policy: A failure of both carrot and stick, Policy and Politics, 15, pp. 49-54, (1987); Lord Irvine, Official Report, House of Lords, (1994); Lloyd L., Proposed reform of the 1968 Caravan Sites Act: Producing a problem to suit a solution?, Critical Social Policy, 38, pp. 77-85, (1993); Lowe R., Shaw W., Travellers, (1993); O'Donovan I., Travellers, settlers and policy, Local Government Studies, 15, pp. 83-89, (1989); Sibley D., Outsiders in Urban Societies, (1981); Sibley D., A robust analysis of a minority census: The distribution of travelling people in England, Environment and Planning A, 16, pp. 1279-1288, (1984); Sibley D., Travelling people in England: Regional comparisons, Regional Studies, 19, pp. 139-147, (1985); Sibley D., Urban change and the exclusion of minority groups in British cities, Geoforum, 21, pp. 483-488, (1990); Todd G., Clark C., Gypsy Site Provision and Policy, (1991)","","","","","","","","","00167487","","","","English","Geography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029767606"

It establishes the substantive concerns of the subdiscipline, acknowledges the sheer diversity of its approaches, key concepts and theories and engages with the resulting major areas of academic debate that stem from this richness. Written in an accessible style and assuming little prior knowledge of topics covered, yet drawing on a wide range of diverse academic literature, the book’s particular originality comes from its extended definition of population geography that locates it firmly within the multiple geographies of the life course. Consequently, issues such as childhood and adulthood, family dynamics, ageing, everyday mobilities, morbidity and differential ability assume a prominent place alongside the classic population geography triumvirate of births, migrations and deaths. This broader framing of the field allows the book to address more holistically aspects of lives across space often provided little attention in current textbooks. Particular note is given to how these lives are shaped though hybrid social, biological and individual arenas of differential life course experience. By engaging with traditional quantitative perspectives and newer qualitative insights, the authors engage students from the quantitative macro scale of population to the micro individual scale. Aimed at higher-level undergraduate and graduate students, this introductory text provides a well-developed pedagogy, including case studies that illustrate theory, concepts and issues. © 2018 Holly R.

Specifically, migration can become a key strategy to attempt to respond to and cope with environmental change. This paper seeks to make sense of one type of migration, counterurbanisation, in this climate breakdown era. It provides conceptual clarity to what is termed ‘climate-related counterurbanisation’ vis-à-vis wider climate-induced migration and positions climate disruption within the counterurbanisation literature. Climate-related counterurbanisation is presented as a largely voluntary movement down the settlement hierarchy as a direct or indirect response to climate change, with positive representations of ‘rurality’ central to the relocation decision: individual adaptation. However, it is mediated by numerous geographically variegated and specific environmental, cultural, social and economic factors. Indeed, it may ultimately come to be seen more as maladaptation than adaptation. While moving from urban to rural may make sense at individual household level, such relocations can overall have much more negative impacts on host rural communities or the urban people left behind. © 2023 The Authors","Adaptation; Climate breakdown; Counterurbanisation; Maladaptation; Mobilities","climate change; counterurbanization; rural-urban migration; social impact; social mobility","","","","","","","Abel G., Brottrager M., Cuaresma J., Muttarak R., Climate, conflict and forced migration, Global Environmental Change, 54, pp. 239-249, (2019); Aberg H., Tondelli S., Escape to the country: A reaction-driven rural renaissance on a Swedish island post COVID-19, Sustainability, 13, 22, (2021); Adams H., Adger W., Changing places: Migration and adaptation to climate change, (2013); Adger W., Arnell N., Black R., Dercon S., Geddes A., Thomas D., Focus on environmental risks and migration: Causes and consequences, Environmental Research Letters, 10, 6, (2015); Adger W., Crepin A., Folke C., Ospina D., Chapin F., Segerson K., Wilen J., Urbanization, migration, and adaptation to climate change, One Earth, 3, 4, pp. 396-399, (2020); Ajibade I., Sullivan M., Haeffner M., Why climate migration is not managed retreat: Six justifications, Global Environmental Change, 65, (2020); Anastasiou E., Duquenne M., Determinants and spatial patterns of counterurbanization in times of crisis: Evidence from Greece, Population Review, 59, 2, pp. 85-110, (2020); Anguelovski I., Pellow D.N., Towards an emancipatory urban climate justice through adaptation, Planning Theory & Practice, 16, pp. 308-313, (2020); Anthopoulou T., Kaberis N., Petrou M., Aspects and experiences of crisis in rural Greece.

Two main conventional approaches to this issue are to define the rural in either descriptive or socio-cultural terms. However, both can be criticized from a theoretical standpoint for adopting an inadequate conceptualization of space. As a result, there is an increasing but problematic tendency to try to define the rural in terms of a distinctive type of locality. However, there is yet another means of definition, which has been somewhat neglected in the literature. This alternative can best be approached from an understanding of the theory of social representations and the contrasting discourses of academics and non-academics. A modified version of the theory enables us to define the rural in terms of the disembodied cognitive structures which we use as rules and resources in order to make sense of our everyday world, through both discursive and non-discursive actions. Moreover, in an increasingly post-modern era it can be argued that such an 'immaterial' definition may be assuming dominance over its locality-based alternative. © Richard Munton 2008.","","","","","","","","","Appleyard D., The environment as a social symbol, Ekistics, 278, pp. 272-281, (1979); Bakhtin M.M., Rabelais and his World., (1984); Barlow J., Landowners, property ownership and the rural locality, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 10, pp. 309-329, (1986); Barthes R., Elements of Semiology., (1967); Baudrillard J., Simulations., (1983); Baudrillard J., Selected Writings, (1988); Bealer R., Willits F., Kuvlesky W., The meaning of 'rurality' in American society, Rural Sociology, 30, pp. 255-266, (1965); Bell C., Newby H., Community Studies., (1971); Bell C., Newby H., The Sociology of Community., (1974); Bhaskar R., A Realist Theory of Science., (1975); Bhaskar R., The Possibility of Naturalism: a Philosophical Critique of the Contemporary Human Sciences., (1979); Blishen E., Town, bad: country, good, Second Nature, pp. 15-24, (1984); Bourdieu P., Distinction: a Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste., (1984); Bowers J., Review of 'Discourse and Social Psychology, British Journal of Social Psychology, 27, pp. 185-192, (1988); Bradley T., Capitalism and countryside: rural sociology as political economy, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 5, pp. 581-587, (1981); Bradley T., Lowe P., Locality and Rurality., (1984); Brewer J., Micro-sociology and the 'duality of structure, Actions and Structure, pp. 144-166, (1988); Canter D., The Psychology of Place., (1977); Carlson J.E., Lassey M.L., Lassey W.R., Rural Society and Environment in America., (1981); Castells M., The Urban Question., (1977); Castells M., Crisis, planning, and the quality of life: managing the new historical relationships between space and society, Society and Space, 1, pp. 3-21, (1983); Champion A.G., Coombes M., A nation on the move, Geographical Magazine, 56, pp. 245-248, (1984); Champion A.G., Coombes M., Openshaw S., New regions for a new Britain, Geographical Magazine, 56, pp. 187-190, (1984); Champion A.G., Green A., Owen D., Ellin D., Coombes M., Changing Places., (1987); Cherry G.E., Rural Planning Problems., (1976); Clark G., The meaning of agricultural regions, Scottish Geographical Magazine, 100, pp. 34-44, (1984); Cloke P.J., An index of rurality for England and Wales, Regional Studies, 11, pp. 31-46, (1977); Cloke P.J., Changing patterns of urbanisation in rural areas of England and Wales, 1961-1971, Regional Studies, 12, pp. 603-617, (1978); Cloke P.J., New emphases for applied rural geography, Progress in Human Geography, 4, pp. 181-217, (1980); Cloke P.J., Whither rural studies?, Journal of Rural Studies, 1, pp. 1-9, (1985); Cloke P.J., Edwards G., Rurality in England and Wales 1981: a replication of the 1971 index, Regional Studies, 20, pp. 289-306, (1986); Cloke P.J., Park C.C., Rural Resource Management: a Geographical Perspective., (1984); Clout H.D., Rural Geography: an Introductory Survey., (1972); Connell J., The End of Tradition.

Sensing that the predominant everyday 'meaning' of second homes within Nordic countries generally is markedly different from the UK, the article draws attention to how they are contextually interpreted. From a focus on everyday life and post-capitalist critique, attention is given to the diversity of interpretations applicable to second homes consumption. Whilst 'mainstream' interpretations or readings tend to stress either the 'elite' character of second homes consumption or rootedness within more democratic 'tradition', foregrounding the context of the 'era of mobilities' presents two different readings. First, second home consumption appears congruent with a 'dynamic heterolocalist' existence, whereby 'home' is distributed across places of differing experiential qualities for the consumer. Second, and more radically, the latter reading can be challenged. It is suggested that instead of being functional for achieving home within the era of mobilities, second home consumption, not least through association with both representational and more-than-representational aspects of rurality, traces an attempted 'line of flight' to a heterotopic place and to potentially postcapitalist existential priorities. The conclusion calls for more in-depth research on second home consumption, whilst noting that despite any earlier radical message second homes remain elite forms of consumption. © 2011 Norwegian Geographical Society.","Consumption; Mobilities; Reading for difference; Rurality; Second homes","Norway; consumption behavior; mobility; research work; rural area; rural society; second home","","","","","","","Abram S., Movement and Nature: Holiday Practices and Norwegian 'hytter', (2007); Basch L., Glick-Schiller N., Szanton-Blanc C., Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments, and Deterritorialized Nation-States, (1994); Bauman Z., Liquid Modernity, (2000); Baylina M., Berg N., Selling the countryside: Representations of rurality in Norway and Spain, European Urban and Regional Studies, 17, pp. 277-292, (2010); Bell D., Variations on the rural idyll, Handbook of Rural Studies, pp. 149-160, (2006); Bendix R., Lofgren O., Special Issue: Double homes, double lives?, Ethnologia Europaea, 37, pp. 7-148, (2007); Berman M., All That is Solid Melts Into Air, (1983); Bjerke T., Kaltenborn B., Vitterso J., Cabin life: Restorative and affective aspects, Multiple Dwelling and Tourism: Negotiating Place, Home and Identity, pp. 87-102, (2006); Blackman L., Venn C., Affect, Body and Society, 16, pp. 7-28, (2010); Blunt A., Dowling R., Home, (2006); Bourdieu P., Distinction, (1984); Bunce M., Reproducing rural idylls, Country Visions, pp. 14-30, (2003); Carolan M., More-than-representational knowledge/s of the countryside: How we think as bodies, Sociologia Ruralis, 48, pp. 408-422, (2008); Casey E., Between geography and philosophy: What does it mean to be in the place-world?, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 91, pp. 683-693, (2001); Chatterton P., Pickerill J., Everyday activism and transitions towards post-capitalist worlds, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 35, pp. 475-490, (2010); Clifford J., Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century, (1997); Coppock J., Second Homes: Curse Or Blessing?, (1977); Cresswell T., On the Move: Mobility in the Modern Western World, (2006); Crouch D., Home, escape and identity: Rural cultures and sustainable tourism, Rural Tourism and Sustainable Development, pp. 93-101, (1994); Deleuze G., Guattari F., A Thousand Plateaus, (1987); Foucault M., Of other spaces, Diacritics, 16, pp. 22-27, (1986); Gallent N., Second homes, community and a hierarchy of dwelling, Area, 39, pp. 97-106, (2007); Gallent N., Mace A., Tewdwr-Jones M., Second Homes: European Perspectives and UK Policies, (2005); Gardiner M., Critiques of Everyday Life, (2000); Garvey P., The Norwegian country cabin and functionalism: A tale of two modernities, Social Anthropology/Anthropologie Sociale, 16, pp. 203-220, (2008); Gibson-Graham J.K., The End of Capitalism as We Knew It, (1996); Gibson-Graham J.K., A Postcapitalist Politics, (2006); Gustafson P., Place attachment and mobility, Multiple Dwelling and Tourism: Negotiating Place, Home and Identity, pp. 17-31, (2006); Halfacree K., Still surprises in store: Revisiting the ordinary in rural geography, Documents D'Anàlisi Geogràfica, 50, pp. 87-103, (2007); Halfacree K., Reading rural consumption practices for difference: Boltholes, castles and life-rafts, Culture Unbound, 2, pp. 241-263, (2010); Halfacree K., Counter-urbanisation, Second Homes and Rural Consumption in the Era of Mobilities; Halfacree K., International Handbook of Rural Demography; Hall C., Muller D., Introduction: Second homes, curse or blessing?

We test a simple hypothesis that families tend to move long distances in favor of the male's career and that this can have a detrimental effect on women's employment status. Unlike many previous studies of this question, our work emphasizes the importance of identifying couples that have migrated together, rather than simply comparing long-distance (fe)male migrants with nonmigrant (fe)males individually. We demonstrate that women's employment status is harmed by family migration; the results we present are surprisingly consistent for Great Britain and the United States, despite differing economic situations and cultural norms regarding gender and migration. We also demonstrate that studies that fail to identify linked migrant couples are likely to underestimate the negative effects of family migration on women's employment status.","","Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Emigration and Immigration; Employment; Family Characteristics; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Socioeconomic Factors; Spouses; United States; Women; adolescent; adult; article; comparative study; cultural factor; employment; family size; female; human; male; middle aged; migration; socioeconomics; spouse; statistical model; statistics; United Kingdom; United States","","","","","","","Bailey A.J., Cooke T.J., Family migration and employment: The importance of migration history and gender, International Regional Science Review, 21, pp. 99-118, (1998); Becker G., Investment in human capital: A theoretical analysis, Journal of Political Economy, 70, pp. 9-49, (1975); Bell M., Boyle P.J., Hugo G., Rees P., Stillwell J.C.H., A battery of methods for comparing migration between countries illustrated for Australia and Britain, Conference on International Geographical Union Commission on Population and the Environment, Models, Methods, and Theory in Population Geography, (1998); Bielby W.T., Bielby D.D., I will follow him: Family ties, gender-role beliefs, and reluctance to relocate for a better job, American Journal of Sociology, 97, pp. 1241-1267, (1992); Blau P.M., Duncan O.D., The American Occupational Structure, (1967); Blunt A., Wills J., Dissident Geographies, (2000); Bonney N., Love J., Gender and migration: Geographical mobility and the wife's sacrifice, Sociological Review, 39, pp. 335-348, (1991); Boyle P.J., Public housing as a barrier to long-distance migration, International Journal of Population Geography, 1, pp. 147-164, (1995); Boyle P.J., Cooke T.J., Halfacree K.H., Smith D.P., Integrating GB and US census microdata for migration analysis: A study of the effects of family migration on partnered women's employment status, International Journal of Population Geography, 5, pp. 157-178, (1999); Boyle P.J., Halfacree K.H., Robinson V., Exploring Contemporary Migration, (1998); Boyle P.J., Halfacree K.H., Smith D.P., Family migration and female participation in the labour market: Moving beyond individual-level analyses, Migration and Gender in Developed Countries, pp. 114-135, (1999); Brown M., Boyle P.J., Governmentality, sexuality and the census, Closet Space, pp. 88-115, (2000); Bruegel I., The trailing wife: A declining breed, Changing Forms of Employment, pp. 235-258, (1996); Who gets on the escalator?

Some of the most important quantitative and qualitative methods used for the description and analysis of migration are presented in a clearly structured and accessible way. The various theoretical approaches used to explain the complex patterns of migration are also summarised. These patterns are then explored through the use of specific migration-related themes: employment, stage in the life course, quality of life, societal engineering, violence and persecution, and the role of culture. Exploring Contemporary Migration is written in a user-friendly, accessible style, appealing to undergraduate students of population geography and social science students taking a population module. This text will also be valuable reading to those researchers and academics concerned with gaining a broad understanding of the dynamics and patterns of contemporary population. © 1998, Taylor & Francis.

Two main conventional approaches to this issue are to define the rural in either descriptive or socio-cultural terms. However, both can be criticized from a theoretical standpoint for adopting an inadequate conceptualization of space. As a result, there is an increasing but problematic tendency to try to define the rural in terms of a distinctive type of locality. However, there is yet another means of definition, which has been somewhat neglected in the literature. This alternative can best be approached from an understanding of the theory of social representations and the contrasting discourses of academics and non-academics. A modified version of the theory enables us to define the rural in terms of the disembodied cognitive structures which we use as rules and resources in order to make sense of our everyday world, through both discursive and non-discursive actions. Moreover, in an increasingly post-modern era it can be argued that such an 'immaterial' definition may be assuming dominance over its locality-based alternative. © 1993.","","locality research; rural definition; social representation; theoretical studies","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","Acknowledgements - The author would like to thank an anonymous referee for a number of useful comments and the ESRC for funding the original Ph.D. research which inspired this paper.","Appleyard, The environment as a social symbol, Ekistics, 278, pp. 272-281, (1979); Bakhtin, Rabelais and his World, (1984); Barlow, Landowners, property ownership and the rural locality, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 10, pp. 309-329, (1986); Barthes, Elements of Semiology, (1967); Baudrillard, Simulations, (1983); Baudrillard, Selected Writings, (1988); Bealer, Willits, Kuvlesky, The meaning of ‘rurality’ in American society, Rural Sociology, 30, pp. 255-266, (1965); Bell, Newby, Community Studies, (1971); Bell, Newby, The Sociology of Community, (1974); Bhaskar, A Realist Theory of Science, (1975); Bhaskar, The Possibility of Naturalism: a Philosophical Critique of the Contemporary Human Sciences, (1979); Blishen, Town, bad: country, good, Second Nature, pp. 15-24, (1984); Bourdieu, Distinction: a Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, (1984); Bowers, Review of ‘Discourse and Social Psychology’, British Journal of Social Psychology, 27, pp. 185-192, (1988); Bradley, Capitalism and countryside: rural sociology as political economy, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 5, pp. 581-587, (1981); Bradley, Lowe, Locality and Rurality, (1984); Brewer, Micro-sociology and the ‘duality of structure’, Actions and Structure, pp. 144-166, (1988); Canter, The Psychology of Place, (1977); Carlson, Lassey, Lassey, Rural Society and Environment in America, (1981); Castells, The Urban Question, (1977); Castells, Crisis, planning, and the quality of life: managing the new historical relationships between space and society, Society and Space, 1, pp. 3-21, (1983); Champion, Coombes, A nation on the move, Geographical Magazine, 56, pp. 245-248, (1984); Champion, Coombes, Openshaw, New regions for a new Britain, Geographical Magazine, 56, pp. 187-190, (1984); Champion, Green, Owen, Ellin, Coombes, Changing Places, (1987); Cherry, Rural Planning Problems, (1976); Clark, The meaning of agricultural regions, Scottish Geographical Magazine, 100, pp. 34-44, (1984); Cloke, An index of rurality for England and Wales, Regional Studies, 11, pp. 31-46, (1977); Cloke, Changing patterns of urbanisation in rural areas of England and Wales, 1961–1971, Regional Studies, 12, pp. 603-617, (1978); Cloke, New emphases for applied rural geography, Progress in Human Geography, 4, pp. 181-217, (1980); Cloke, Whither rural studies?, Journal of Rural Studies, 1, pp. 1-9, (1985); Cloke, Edwards, Rurality in England and Wales 1981: a replication of the 1971 index, Regional Studies, 20, pp. 289-306, (1986); Cloke, Park, Rural Resource Management: a Geographical Perspective, (1984); Clout, Rural Geography: an Introductory Survey, (1972); Connell, The End of Tradition.

It considers how internal migration can be viewed in an ‘era of mobilities’, how it has traditionally been viewed by scholars, and how internal migration is linked to other forms of spatial mobility. It is argued that internal migration has a central role to play in present-day mobilities but that other forms of mobility need not increase as internal migration does and vice versa: sometimes they facilitate internal migration, other times they prevent it. Migration and non-migration may be seen as attempts to resist and counter the fluid logics of the era of mobilities. It is important to recognise that mobility is prevented for many and is also resisted for its consequences. In an unsettled and mobile world, it is suggested that the twenty-first century requires much more effort in producing both settlement and mobility practices, including those of internal migration, in order to increase human satisfaction. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Tony Champion, Thomas Cooke and Ian Shuttleworth; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Adey P., Mobility, (2010); Barcus H., Halfacree K., An Introduction to Population Geographies: Lives Across Space, (2017); Bauman Z., Liquid Modernity, (2000); Bauman Z., Liquid Times, (2007); Bell M., Ward G., Comparing permanent migration with temporary mobility, Tourism Geographies, 2, pp. 97-107, (2000); Benson M., Osbaldiston N., Understanding Lifestyle Migration, (2014); Brettell C., Anthropology of migration, The Encyclopedia of Global Human Migration, (2013); Brettell C., Hollifield J., Migration Theory: Talking Across Disciplines, (2008); Cameron G., Muellbauer J., The housing market and regional commuting and migration choices, Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 45, 4, pp. 420-446, (1998); Castles S., Miller M., The Age of Migration, (1993); Castles S., de Haas H., Miller M., The Age of Migration, (2014); Cognard F., Forgotten faces of amenity migration: Poor migrants moving to the uplands of France, Global Amenity Migration, pp. 203-218, (2014); Cohen S., Gossling S., A darker side of hypermobility, Environment and Planning A, 47, 8, pp. 1661-1679, (2015); Cohen S., Duncan T., Thulemark M., Introducing lifestyle mobilities, Lifestyle Mobilities: Intersections of Travel, Leisure and Migration, pp. 1-18, (2013); Cooke T., It is not just the economy: Declining migration and the rise of secular rootedness, Population, Space and Place, 17, 3, pp. 193-203, (2011); Cooke T., Internal migration in decline, Professional Geographer, 65, 4, pp. 664-675, (2013); Coulter R., Wishful thinking and the abandonment of moving desires over the life course, Environment and Planning A, 45, 8, pp. 1944-1962, (2013); Coulter R., Van Ham M., Findlay A., Re-thinking residential mobility.

This paper provides a critical overview of its manifestation in Britain over the last 40 years. It emphasizes the importance of placing it in its entangled context of the dominant form(s) that rural space takes. While 1960s/1970s back-to-the-land raised critical questions about the countryside, it mainly 'diverted' marginal spaces to alternatives outside the mainstream. In contrast, it exists today at a time when rural spatiality's 'productivist' alignment is being sorely challenged. This presents, in principle, greater scope both for its longer-term survival and for it to engage in a 'productive' critique of the mainstream rurality that is emerging. The paper suggests that interrogating critically the extent of consubstantial relationships between land and everyday life is also essential for evaluating back-to-the-land experimentation. © 2006 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.","Back-to-the-land; Consubstantiality; Counter-culture; Counter-urbanization; Productivism; Rural change; Rural space","counterurbanization; culture","","","","","","","Abrams P., McCulloch A., Communes, Sociology and Society, (1976); (2004); Aldridge T., Patterson A., LETS get real: Constraints on the development of Local Exchange Trading Schemes, Area, 34, pp. 370-381, (2002); Anderson J., Spatial politics in practice: The style and substance of environmental direct action, Antipode, 36, pp. 106-125, (2004); Anderson T., The Movement and the Sixties, (1995); Whatever happened to the Hippies of Hebden Bridge?, Pennine Magazine, (1984); On Fire.

Yet, while studies of this phenomenon exist, both academic and as memoirs, it has not been researched in detail as much as might have been expected, certainly not in terms of how those involved lived “off the land” and/or outside the US. This paper seeks to resurrect this topic for serious academic consideration. A call to revisit back-to-the-land comes not just from abiding fascination with the Sixties but because this countercultural movement fed into the contemporaneous emergence of a broader and still notable population trend across much of the global North of a “return” to rural living: counterurbanization. Moreover, recent decades have seen the resurgence of countercultural back-to-the-land, building on its long 1960s legacy but now underpinned by a more explicit search for environmentally sustainable lifestyles. This review of back-to-the-land, after noting the demographic place today of counterurbanization, focuses on an overview of long Sixties back-to-the-land and then on the early years of its ongoing resurgence. For both periods, attention is given to how back-to-the-landers have been studied, what their motivations are, whether they move as family or group, how long their rural life tends to last, what opportunities and barriers they have met, and what evidence there is of land work. It is concluded that back-to-the-land today shows considerable continuity with its 1960s heyday but has been more proactive in its spatialized rejection of key everyday life aspects and experiences within contemporary (urban and suburban) mainstream society. In short, a key Sixties phenomenon remains very much alive today but in a more mature form. © 2022 The Author(s).

The paper argues, firstly, that even if we accept temporarily some understanding of counterurbanisation that is close to such portrayals, there is still much to find out and appreciate concerning the significance of the moves, both for those involved and for society and culture more generally. Secondly, though, and especially when acknowledging more fully an international migration dimension to counterurbanisation, the paper exposes this understanding as being far too narrow and easily stereotyped. In response to this perceived partiality, the paper proposes a general model, with counterurbanisation as a flexible three-dimensional category, capable of embracing a broader range of people and experiences than is typically the case.

The case is made for defining 'the rural' as an abstract 'social representation', a set of rules and resources existing out of space and time which are drawn upon in both discursive and non-discursive actions. The precise form that this representation takes in these actions is highly contextualised and depends upon its precise usage. The content of respondents' representations of the rural contained many aspects of the 'rural idyll' familiar to academic researchers, especially in the interviews where the social aspect of rurality was more strongly expressed. However, this resemblance was not a naive acceptance of the idyll but involved a more engaged and often critical reflection on rural living. Hence, the respondents should not be dismissed as the 'cultural dupes' of a Pastoral ideology. Nonetheless, in general, they still set themselves up in representational opposition to what have been labelled 'neglected rural geographies'. © 1995.","","UK, England; residents' perception; rural idyll; sense of place; social representation; geography; interview; perception; questionnaire; social aspect; United Kingdom","","","","","","","Bolton, Chalkley, Counter-urbanisation-disposing of the myths, Town and Country Planning, 58, pp. 249-250, (1990); Cloke, On ‘problems and solutions’.

With this statement, consensus largely ends. Consequently, this article introduces the status of rurality to the reader from four different, sometimes conflicting, sometimes complementary, perspectives. First, it indicates why many authors have suggested that rurality no longer remains a useful or significant category within social science, notwithstanding its widespread popular resilience. Second, it returns to the challenge posed by the latter resilience to argue that this cannot be dismissed so easily. Indeed, it is through popular representations that rurality retains much ontological distinctiveness. Moreover, the suggestion, from Baudrillard, of 'map preceding territory' (rather than vice versa) suggests, third, a rurality much less spatially confined than immediately expected, a state some researchers have called post-rurality. Complicating things still further, adding a nonrepresentational affective aspect leads, fourth, to the proposal that there may still be something in human existential experiences of and engagements with rurality that also support retaining the term as a valid social scientific concept. The article concludes with a model of the rural than going some way to reconciling these perspectives, while accepting that rurality today remains inherently plural, hybrid, and still partly 'undiscovered'. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we investigate three issues that might have masked potential differences in the results between GB and the USA. First, a decision needed to be made about the most appropriate cut-off to distinguish between short-and long-distance migration. Given the different size of the landmasses in GB and the USA it is questionable whether a similar distance cut-off should be adopted in both places. Second, a 1-year interval is used to define migrants in the GB census and a 5-year interval is used in the USA. The longer post-migration period, during which employment may be found, in the USA may have influenced our findings. Third, most 'tied migration' studies compare those in full- or part-time employment with the economically inactive and unemployed. However, individuals are economically inactive or unemployed for very different reasons and we therefore distinguish between these groups in the analysis.","Employment status; Gender; Great Britain; Tied migration; USA","","","","","","","","Bailey A.J., Cooke T.J., Family migration and employment: The importance of migration history and gender, Int.

All personal characteristics had strongly significant relationships with migration, the strongest being age, housing tenure and employment. Younger people were much more likely to be recent migrants; tenants of private rented housing are much more likely to be recent migrants than owner-occupiers: local authority housing does not appear to have a deterrent effect on migrations. Students are highly migratory, and recent migrants are disproportionately likely to be unemployed. Migration is associated with small household size and with late school-leaving age. Distance of move had a significant relationship to all personal characteristics except age and household size. The strongest relationships were with tenure, occupation and social class. Local authority tenants were much less likely than other groups to have moved between counties. The higher social classes and the more prestigious occupations were the most likely to have moved between counties. -from Authors","","UK; Gallup Poll; internal migration; migrants; personal characteristics; population survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00167398","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027059523"

Many diverse factors are typically expressed through any one residential relocation and this complexity must be acknowledged, even it it is at the expense of a degree of parsimony. Around 10% of the British population move house in any one year. At first sight, asking a migrant for the reasons behind their residential relocation would appear to be relatively straightforward. However, in this paper it will be demonstrated that this is far from the case. This research consisted of both mailed questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with households in six rural parishes. Three of these parishes were located in the Lancaster district and three were in mid Devon.

After noting the continued numerical significance of rural populations worldwide, it then proceeds to note some of the key trends that have in the past shaped and continue to shape them, all of which also demonstrate that rural populations cannot ever really be thought of separate from their urban counterparts. Some of the different ways in which rural populations have been studied are then introduced. The article emphasizes throughout the importance of acknowledging popular cultural representations of rural populations as well as their more officially defined manifestations. The former are highly prone to stereotyping and the article therefore ends with a call to challenge and move away from such stereotypes in order to appreciate the considerable diversity and complexity found within rural populations worldwide today. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It went beyond earlier formulations of a simple urban–rural dualism to suggest that the impact of urbanization, in particular, varied across space, inscribing a continuum of differentially urbanized places. Moreover, the sociological character of any place could somehow also be read-off from its location along this continuum. While a huge quantity of subsequent scholarship has critiqued almost all aspects of the continuum concept, not least its reliance on a spatial or environmental determinism, it retains a strong presence in academic work (e.g., medical geography), professional practice (e.g., planning), and everyday life (e.g., our understanding of cities and villages) today. This reflects both its deep embeddedness within cultural understandings of space and a careful and cautious theoretical appreciation that context matters in understanding everyday life. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Such work, influenced prominently by postmodernism and the «cultural turn», seeks to build up a fuller picture of the diversity and variety of lives and experiences found in rural areas today. The present paper, whilst being highly sympathetic to this work, argues that it must not lead to the neglect of the more «ordinary» in the countryside today, or what Chris Philo (1992) famously caricatured as «Mr Average». Although the lives and experiences of Mr Average may initially appear mundane, in the spirit of Henri Lefebvre's critical engagement with the everyday, we can often find within this ordinariness more engaging, even extraordinary truths. The paper develops this argument for the study of «ordinary rural geographies» by examining the ordinary, extraordinary, and extraordinary ordinary within counterurbanisation. However, as reiterated in the conclusion, it advocates the search for the extraordinary within the ordinary across the breadth of rural geography.","Counterurbanisation; Everyday; Lefebvre; Ordinary; Rural geography","Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; counterurbanization; geographical knowledge; rural area","","","","","","","BAILEY A., Population Geography, (2005); BOLTON N., CHALKLEY B., Counter-urbanisation - disposing of the myths, Town and Country Planning, 58, pp. 249-250, (1989); BONNETT M., Retrieving nature: Education for a post-humanist age, Journal of Philosophy of Education, 37, 4, (2003); BOYLE P., HALFACREE K., ROBINSON V., Exploring Contemporary Migration, (1998); BURGESS S., Report of the Rural Advocate, (2006); BUSHIN N., For the sake of the children?: Children's experiences of family migration to the English countryside, (2005); Counterurbanization: The changing pace and nature of population deconcentration, (1989); CLOKE P., New emphases for applied rural geography, Progress in Human Geograph, 4, pp. 181-217, (1980); CLOKE P., On ""problems and solutions"".

A clear policy and cultural outcome from this work would be to advocate the diffusion of egalitarian household decision-making environments with respect to employment careers. Thus, labour migration will become 'de-gendered'. This paper problematises this liberal and meritocratic agenda by pointing to some of its more problematic elements. These difficulties arise from a discursive narrowing of the concept of 'career' and serve to promote a limited instrumentalist esprit de vivre on the part of both men and women. More generally, de-gendering labour migration fits conveniently with the enhanced globalisation project of contemporary capitalism. The importance of ties to distinctive places for people's everyday life and well-being is excised from such a project, and de-gendering labour migration can facilitate this excision. Thus, I argue for a radical utopian political project that enmeshes de-gendering within a broader critique of current socio-political structures.

It argues that contextualising counterurbanisation within the 'era of mobilities' has profound consequences for the concept. After introducing the era of mobilities and its implications for social science, migration's central and multiple places within this discourse are outlined. The paper then examines one set of ideas, 'dynamic heterolocalism', that facilitates the understanding of the existential significance today of the circulatory expressions of migration. Returning to counterurbanisation, the paper draws into its orbit the consumers of rural second homes, understanding of which has also increasingly adopted a quasi-heterolocal tone. An inclusive model of what is then recast terminologically as 'counter-urbanisation' posits it as an extremely heterodox concept, potentially embracing not only second-home owners but also diverse other consumers of rural space or rural sojourners. The paper concludes by reiterating the sustained centrality of 'rurality' to counterurbanisation, second-home consumption, and other expressions of identity within the era of mobilities. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Counterurbanisation; Heterolocalism; Migration; Mobilities; Second homes","counterurbanization; identity construction; mobility; rural area; second home","","","","","","","Arnesen T., Recreational home agglomerations in rural areas in Norway as emerging economic and political space, Proceedings of the Conference on Understanding and Managing Amenity-led Migration in Mountain Regions, (2009); Aronsson L., Place attachment of vacation residents: between tourists and permanent residents, Tourism, Mobility and Second Homes, pp. 75-86, (2004); Bailey A., Making Population Geography, (2005); Barke M., Rural tourism in Spain, International Journal of Tourism Research, 6, pp. 137-149, (2004); Basch L., Glick Schiller N., Szanton-Blanc C., Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments, and Deterritorialized Nation-States, (1994); Bauman Z., Liquid Modernity, (2000); Bell M., Ward G., Comparing permanent migration with temporary mobility, Tourism Geographies, 2, pp. 97-107, (2000); Berman M., All that is Solid Melts into Air, (1983); Berry B., The counterurbanization process: urban America since 1970, Urbanization and Counter-urbanization, pp. 17-30, (1976); Blunt A., Cultural geographies of migration: mobility, transnationality and diaspora, Progress in Human Geography, 31, pp. 684-694, (2007); Blunt A., Dowling R., Home, (2006); Migration into Rural Areas: Theories and Issues, (1998); Boyle P., Halfacree K., Migration into rural areas: a collective behaviour framework?, Migration into Rural Areas: Theories and Issues, pp. 303-316, (1998); Buller H., Hoggart K., International Counterurbanization, (1994); Callon M., The dynamics of techno-economic networks, Technological Change and Company Strategies: Economic and Sociological Perspectives, pp. 77-102, (1992); Chambers I., Migrancy, Culture, Identity, (1994); Counterurbanization: The Changing Pace and Nature of Population Deconcentration, (1989); Champion A., Conclusion: temporary anomaly, long-term trend or transitional phase?, Counterurbanization: The Changing Pace and Nature of Population Deconcentration, pp. 230-244, (1989); Champion A., Urban and regional demographic trends in the developed world, Urban Studies, 29, pp. 461-482, (1992); Champion A., Population change and migration in Britain since 1981: evidence for continuing deconcentration, Environment and Planning A, 26, pp. 1501-1520, (1994); Champion A., Studying counterurbanisation and the rural population turnaround, Migration into Rural Areas.

Faecal sludge biochar has the potential to improve acidic, low nutrient soils and crop yield in developing nations more at risk of climate change and food insecurity. Little research has been conducted into public acceptance of faecal sludge biochar as a soil enhancer in agriculture. In this study of the public in Swansea, Wales, an online survey examines their awareness of, and comfort levels of eating food grown using biosolids, wood biochar and faecal sludge biochar. Our findings show that males were almost twice as likely than females to have a positive perception of biosolids (OR 1.91, p value 0.004) and faecal sludge biochar (OR 2.02, p value 0.03). Those in the oldest age group (65+) were almost five times more likely to have a positive view of faecal sludge biochar than the youngest age group (OR 4.88, p value 0.001). Deployment of faecal sludge biochar must overcome a “disgust effect” related to its human faecal origins. This factor must be centrally taken into account when implementing management and policy decisions regarding the land application of biosolids and faecal sludge biochar. © 2022 by the authors.","biochar; biosolids; faecal sludge; land application; public perception; Wales","Swansea [Wales]; United Kingdom; Wales; agricultural application; biochar; biosolid; climate change; crop yield; perception; pollutant removal; sludge","","","","","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1149054); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Global Challenges Research Fund, GCRF; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P032591/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Swansea University","This work was supported, in whole or in part, by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1149054], and under the grant conditions of the Foundation, a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic License has already been assigned to the Author Accepted Manuscript version that might arise from this submission.

However, interest tends to stop with spatial relocation, with migrants' subsequent lives in rural places much less examined. Such imbalance reflects a more general bias in favour of studying distinctive actions, such as migration, at the expense of non-actions, such as staying put. This article challenges this situation. It argues for regarding migration in a more contextual, biographical and distributed manner, even potentially attaining some characteristics of what is known in non-representational theory as an 'event'. While pro-rural migration is usually initially a contemplated 'representational' action, the significance to the migrant of the resulting relocation does not end here, requiring attention to be paid to everyday entanglements with (rural) place. Becoming event-like, some experiences may be unanticipated and unexpected rather than foreshadowed. This sensitivity is applied in the article through introduction of an interpretative map for exploring why and how pro-rural migrants subsequently stay in their destinations. Proceeding through the map, concerns with representations of the location are increasingly left behind in favour of becoming more attentive to life course issues and more-than-representational rural experiences shaping the migrant's 'line of growth'. © 2011 The Authors.

After noting the continued numerical significance of rural populations worldwide, it then proceeds to note some of the key trends that have in the past shaped and continue to shape them, all of which also demonstrate that rural populations cannot ever really be thought of separate from their urban counterparts. Some of the different ways in which rural populations have been studied are then introduced. The article emphasizes throughout the importance of acknowledging popular cultural representations of rural populations as well as their more officially defined manifestations. The former are highly prone to stereotyping and the article therefore ends with a call to challenge and move away from such stereotypes in order to appreciate the considerable diversity and complexity found within rural populations worldwide today. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One reason why such travellers have created a ""moral panic' concerns their lack of a place within the predominant social representation of rurality within British culture - the ""rural idyll'. At least the ""real Gypsy' has a place on the margins of that representation.

Globally, a large percentage of the population resides in what are widely recognized as rural areas. However, these populations are unevenly found at all spatial scales, are extremely diverse in social composition, and are experiencing considerable and often rapid transformations. Key demographic trends promoting rural population complexity in both Global North and South are rural out-migration, not least from people seeking better everyday lives in cities; counterurbanization, or rural in-migration of people similarly seeking better lives but in the countryside; population circulation incorporating rural locations, and return migrations to former rural homelands; and consequences of geographically anomalous high or low rural death or birth rates. Geographers research all such processes using statistics, surveys, and more qualitative methods. This attention remains vital, not least for interrogating the consequences of strongly entrenched cultural stereotypes of rural people portrayed in overly negative, positive, and/or otherwise simplistic terms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

First, I outline the main elements of a new model for thinking about rural space in general that tries to incorporate three different facets of 'space' that have been teased out through geographical scholarship. This draws inspiration from work by Henri Lefebvre. After demonstrating this model in respect of the post-1945 productivist rural, I introduce it to debates about the emerging contours of the post-productivist countryside. Drawing predominantly on British examples, the second half of the paper develops one element within the heterogeneous potentiality of this post-productivism to consider some key aspects of what I term an example of 'radical' rural spatiality. This examines its perceived localities, conceived formal representations and partially lived everyday lives. The final main section gives brief consideration to opportunities now being presented to this radical rurality but also notes the considerable challenges that lie ahead. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Whilst it finds and argues that a ‘resurgence’ was apparent, it may not have been as strong or lasting as was suggested by media reports in particular. Indeed, numerous challenges to any such a resurgence are noted, drawn especially from recent reflections on the pandemic period. Nonetheless, any counterurban revival is seen as being significant more widely as it fits with a wider resurgent interest in ‘all things rural’ that pre-dated COVID-19 but was stimulated further by it. In contrast to the widely celebrated rural, the paper also notes how city life was often seen as unsatisfactory during the pandemic, not least because its usual underpinning by diverse everyday mobilities was strongly compromised. This condition stimulated, in particular, a turn to rural often more for pragmatic than idealistic reasons, such as for health and to have more freedom and space. Overall, the whole COVID-19 experience sits within a range of political questions about access to space centrally involving the rural. © 2024","Counterurbanisation; COVID-19 pandemic; Global north rural; Rural resurgence; Urban-rural relations","counterurbanization; COVID-19; Northern Hemisphere; rural society; social mobility; urban-rural migration","","","","","","","Aberg H., Tondelli S., Escape to the country: a reaction-driven rural renaissance on a Swedish island post COVID-19, Sustainability, 13, (2021); Acuto M., COVID-19: lessons for an urban(izing) world, One Earth, 2, 4, pp. 317-319, (2020); Ahrend R., Betin M., Caldas M., Cournede B., Ramirez M., Pionnier P.-A., Sanchez-Serra D., Veneri P., Ziemann V., Changes in the geography housing demand after the onset of COVID-19: first results from large metropolitan areas in 13 OECD countries, OECD Economics Department Working, (2022); Argent N., Plummer P., Counterurbanisation in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in new South Wales, 2016-21, Habitat Int., 150, (2024); Barkham P., ‘Green prozac’,  March, pp. 6-11, (2020); Battis T., Jones A., “Plate-shaming” is happening in Atlantic Canada as locals fear those from outside the “bubble,  July, (2020); Batty M., Clifton J., Tyler P., Wan L., The post-Covid city, Camb.

With this statement, consensus largely ends. Consequently, this article introduces the status of rurality to the reader from four different, sometimes conflicting, sometimes complementary, perspectives. First, it indicates why many authors have suggested that rurality no longer remains a useful or significant category within social science, notwithstanding its widespread popular resilience. Second, it returns to the challenge posed by the latter resilience to argue that this cannot be dismissed so easily. Indeed, it is through popular representations that rurality retains much ontological distinctiveness. Moreover, the suggestion, from Baudrillard, of ‘map preceding territory’ (rather than vice versa) suggests, third, a rurality much less spatially confined than immediately expected, a state some researchers have called post-rurality. Complicating things still further, adding a nonrepresentational affective aspect leads, fourth, to the proposal that there may still be something in human existential experiences of and engagements with rurality that also support retaining the term as a valid social scientific concept. The article concludes with a model of the rural than going some way to reconciling these perspectives, while accepting that rurality today remains inherently plural, hybrid, and still partly ‘undiscovered’. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It does this through engaging its artistic expression within a branch of Country Music known as Americana and, more specifically, through the American West articulated in the songs of musician and author Willy Vlautin, expressed by his bands Richmond Fontaine and the Delines. The paper shows both Americana in general and Vlautin's songs in particular to predominantly present a bleak and brutal picture of what is termed ‘abandoned rural America’ depicting rural to small-city lives destroyed by both ‘internal’ and ‘external’ forces. Moreover, this grim condition seems little assuaged through the kinds of residential migration and more everyday mobilities that may be associated with the West's Frontier myth of salvation or today's supposed era of mobilities. However, through a Gibson-Graham inspired reading for difference and sensitised by Neil Campbell's idea of an affective critical regionality, an alternative story of a more positive if fragile rural geography can be identified. Vlautin's songs well express this geography of hope as rooted in recuperative liminal but often deeply emplaced ‘pauses’ within a gruelling everyday life-course. Indeed, the abandoned rural West can be seen to present heterotopic existential life-rafts to its ‘drowning’ people, a position rural spaces today can be seen to adopt more generally, expressing, in sum, an affective critical rurality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","American West; Americana; Anti-idyll; Heterotopia; Music; Rural","United States; abandoned land; migration; music; populism; residential mobility; rural area","","","","","","","Anderson B., Morton F., Revill G., Editorial.

After introducing these practices and pointing out the selectivity that always goes with them, the paper explores the well-known population geography phenomenon of counterurbanisation. It is claimed that taxonomic practices have worked hard in the construction of a 'counterurbanisation story', a relatively clear-cut or purified account of population change in rural areas. Residualised within this talk is a range of 'marginal settlers'. These include 'new crofters' in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and 'new settlers' from Southwest England, both of which are introduced here. Although these groups could be integrated within more conventional forms of counterurbanisation, and thus stirred into the counterurbanisation story, this strategy is not advocated here. Instead, through adopting a more dialectical perspective on counterurbanisation overall, marginal settlers can be seen to be examples of both 'counterurbanisation' and of a critical alternative to it. This more open perspective is important as it allows greater recognition of the dynamic, practical and social nature of taxonomic practices in general and, more specifically, facilitates an appreciation of a politically radical perspective on rural change.

Providing a critical appraisal of migration scholarship from the perspective of Geography, reviewing theory, substantive foci and method, this book demonstrates how sub-national migration in the UK gives rise to and reflects new patterns of population, housing, economies and cultures. Each chapter is written by a Population Geographer together with a scholar representing another Human Geography sub-discipline thus providing a cross-disciplinary perspective on a specific aspect of migration. Critically reviewing and setting an agenda for internal migration scholarship from a spatial perspective, this book will be of interest to academics and students of Geography and other disciplines concerned with migration, both within the UK and further afield. © 2015 Darren P.

It went beyond earlier formulations of a simple urban-rural dualism to suggest that the impact of urbanization, in particular, varied across space, inscribing a continuum of differentially urbanized places. Moreover, the sociological character of any place could somehow also be read-offfrom its location along this continuum. While a huge quantity of subsequent scholarship has critiqued almost all aspects of the continuum concept, not least its reliance on a spatial or environmental determinism, it retains a strong presence in academic work (e.g., medical geography), professional practice (e.g., planning), and everyday life (e.g., our understanding of cities and villages) today. This reflects both its deep embeddedness within cultural understandings of space and a careful and cautious theoretical appreciation that context matters in understanding everyday life. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper engages with this observation, arguing the simple but axiomatic point that the rural is not solely a human taxonomic creation but expresses a space that integrally and intimately involves the more-than-human. Consequently, the latter should be strongly, firmly and richly represented up-front within the defining rural debate. Adopting an established if, to date, still anthropocentricised three-fold model of rural space, the paper argues that each dimension – localities, representations, lives – feature the more-than-human in both passive and active ways. Overall, bringing more-than-human perspectives much further to the fore consolidates the idea of rural as inherently co-produced, a ‘baroque assemblage’ containing many more-than-human living things. Accounts of animals within such a rural must recognise their emplacing from a diversity of foci, interests and consequences. The paper begins to introduce details of this diverse co-production with respect to one ubiquitous rural animal, the sheep. It illustrates the ‘ensheeping’ of rural localities, representations and lives, with the practical significance of this brought together and drawn out through two rival accounts of sheep within the Lake District National Park. Finally, the seemingly modest call for rural studies to embrace animals more fully is argued to be enhanced today by ongoing and potentially imminent experiences impacting strongly on rural places. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Animals; More-than-human; Production of space; Rural; Sheep","Cumbria; England; Lake District; United Kingdom; adaptive management; grazing; national park; rural economy; rural society; sheep","","","","","","","Amery H., Cartwright S., Woolly Stops the Train, (2005); Anderson B., McFarlane C., Assemblage and geography, Area, 43, 2, pp. 124-127, (2011); Anderson B., Kearnes M., McFarlane C., Swanton D., On assemblages and geography, Dialog.

It focuses primarily on the demographic expressions of fertility (births), migration (residential movements), and mortality (deaths). These expressions are researched using the full range of methods deployed by geographers across the discipline: empirical description and mapping; numerical modeling and prediction; critical socioeconomic, political, and cultural analysis; detailed interpretative understanding; and policy-focused scrutiny. Recent subdisciplinary concerns to articulate this diversity coherently include calls to align population geography with a more holistic focus on people's life courses. Holistic approaches highlight the connections demographic expressions have with other lived elements of a typical life: from childhood and upbringing; through (dis)ability, work, leisure, and family; to retirement, health, and everyday living vulnerabilities. A strong subdisciplinary position for population geography is especially necessary given the global prominence of population topics. These range from long-standing population geography themes—urbanization; global, national, and localized population change; the rise of an “age of migration”; sustained socioeconomic; and other inequalities—to recently highlighted global trends—global warming; resource depletion; biotechnology. Population geography is intrinsically entangled with other (sub)disciplines as it seeks to contribute to understanding and shaping humanity's global futures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
