Little is known regarding the impact of air pollution in-utero and early childhood on health outcomes related to undernutrition. The aim of our study is to evaluate the association of prenatal and early-life exposure to PM2.5 and child malnutrition as captured by the height-for-age z-score (HAZ), and stunting in 32 countries in Africa. We also evaluated critical windows of susceptibility during pregnancy to each environmental risk. Methods: We linked nationally representative anthropometric data from 58 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) (n = 264,207 children < 5 years of age) with the average in-utero PM2.5 concentrations derived from satellite imagery. We then estimated associations between PM2.5 and stunting and HAZ after controlling for child, mother and household factors, and trends in time and seasonality. Results: We observed lower HAZ and increased stunting with higher in-utero PM2.5 exposure, with statistically significant associations observed for stunting (OR: 1.016 (95% CI: 1.002, 1.030), for a 10 μg/m3 increase). The associations observed were robust to various model specifications. Wald tests revealed that sex, wealth quintile and urban/rural were not significant effect modifiers of these associations. When evaluating associations between trimester-specific PM2.5 levels, we observed that associations between PM2.5 and stunting was the largest. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies for the African continent to investigate in-utero and early-life exposure to PM2.5 is an important marker of childhood undernutrition. Our results highlight that PM2.5 concentrations need to be urgently mitigated to help address undernutrition in children on the continent. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Child, Preschool; Family Characteristics; Female; Growth Disorders; Humans; Mothers; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; Rural Population; Africa; atmospheric pollution; malnutrition; pregnancy; public health; Africa; air pollution; anthropometric parameters; Article; child; childhood; controlled study; female; height for age z score; human; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; particulate matter 2.5; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; risk factor; rural area; seasonal variation; sex difference; socioeconomics; stunting; urban area; adverse event; air pollutant; family size; growth disorder; mother; particulate matter; preschool child; rural population","","Air Pollutants, ; Particulate Matter, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P2C HD041020); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (UL1TR001863)","KM acknowledges support from the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University, which receives funding from the NIH (P2C HD041020).

The common local reference ESR values are more accuracy in blood test that are established with natural geographical factors by using the multiple linear regression (MLR) model and the artificial neural network (ANN). These knowledge-based methods have limitations since the knowledge domains of ESR and natural geographical factors are limited. This paper presents a new cases-depended model to establish reference ESR values with natural geographical factors and location using case-based reasoning (CBR) since knowledge domain of ESR and geographical factors is weak. Overall 224 local normal ESR values of China that calculated from 13 623 samples were obtained, and the corresponding natural geographical factors and location that include altitude, sunshine hours, relative humidity, temperature, precipitation, annual temperature range and annual average wind speed were obtained from the National Geomatics Center of China. CBR was used to predict the unseen local reference ESR values with cases. The average absolute deviation (AAD), mean square error (MSE), prediction accuracy (PA), and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the observed and estimated data of proposed model is 33.07%, 9.02, 66.93% and 0.78, which are better than those of ANN and MLR model. The results show that the proposed model provides higher prediction accuracy than those of the artificial neural network and multiple linear regression models. The predicted values are very close to the observed values. Model results show significant agreement of cases data. Consequently, the model is used to predict the unseen local reference ESR with natural geographical factors and location. In spatial, the highest ESR reference areas are distributed in the southern-western district of China that includes Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangxi and Guizhou provinces, and the reference ESR values are greater than 23 mm/60 min. The higher ESR reference values are distributed in the middle part and northern-eastern of China which include Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, and the reference ESR values are greater than 18 mm/60 min.

Mobile individuals often have higher rates of sexual risk behavior compared to non-mobile individuals, but the reasons why are not clear. Using monthly retrospective panel data from 202 men and 282 women in Agbogbloshie, Ghana, we tested whether short-term mobility was associated with changes in coital frequency, and whether the association was due to the act of travel in the given month (e.g., enabling higher risk behavior), the reason for travel, or an individual’s travel propensity at other times in the year. Overnight travel specifically to visit family or friends, or for education, health, or other reasons, was associated with increased coital frequency for men. However, men with higher travel propensities had lower overall coital frequency and the act of traveling enabled more sex only for the most frequent male travelers. Men who seldom traveled had much higher coital frequency, but the act of traveling was not associated with additional sex acts. For women, travel for education, health, or other reasons increased coital frequency. Occasional female travelers had slightly more sex acts compared to non-mobile women, and the act of traveling for these women was associated with slight increases in coital frequency, supporting the enabling hypothesis. Highly mobile women had fewer sex acts per month on average. Our findings suggest that mobility characteristics measured on a broad temporal scale, as well as the reason for mobility, are important to understand the relationship between short-term mobility and sexual behavior. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Circular migration; Ghana; Health; Sexual risk behavior; Temporal scale","Adult; Coitus; Female; Ghana; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Marital Status; Retrospective Studies; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Social Environment; Travel; adult; article; controlled study; education; female; friend; Ghana; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; sexual behavior; travel; coitus; Ghana; human relation; marriage; psychology; retrospective study; sexuality; social environment","","","","","Ghana AIDS Commission; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (P30AI050409); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R00HD057533, R24 HD042828)","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the study participants and the following for their invaluable assistance of this project: Dr. Francis Dodoo, Kamil Fuseini, Fidelia Dake and the staff at the Regional Institute for Population Research at the University of Ghana, the Ghana AIDS Commission, our interview team: Vincent Kantah, Patrick Nyarko, Charlotte Ofori, Cecilia Segbedji, Maame Yaa Konamah Siaw, Bilaal Tackie, Habakkuk Tarezina, Solomon Tetteh, and Dr. William Ampofo and his laboratory staff at NMIMR: Prince Parbie and Joyce Appiah- Kubi.

Land degradation reduces agricultural productivity, impacts the provision of vital ecosystem services, and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through Sustainable Development Goal 15.3, sets out to achieve land degradation neutrality (LDN) by improving the livelihoods of those most affected and building resilience in areas affected by or at risk from degradation. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) leads the charge in creating a spatially explicit framework for monitoring and reporting on LDN goals that countries can integrate into their land planning policies. However, it remains difficult to operationalize the integration of biophysical indicators of land degradation with climatic and socio-economic indicators to assess the impact of land degradation on vulnerable populations. We present an integrative framework that demonstrates how freely available global geospatial data sets can be leveraged through an open-source platform (Trends.Earth) to simplify and operationalize monitoring and reporting on progress towards achieving LDN. Then, we summarize a suite of data sets and approaches that can be used to understand and quantify the socio-ecological interactions between drought, land degradation and population exposed to desertification, land degradation and drought. We discuss how improvements in Earth observation data sets and algorithms will allow UNCCD land-based progress sub-indicators (changes in primary productivity, land cover, soil organic carbon, drought, and population exposure) to be computed at enhanced spatial resolutions. © 2022 The Authors.

With the growing number of studies reporting findings from this field and the critical need for public health and policy decisions to be based on the strongest science possible, transparency and clarity in reporting in spatial lifecourse epidemiologic studies is essential. A task force supported by the International Initiative on Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology (ISLE) identified a need for guidance in this area and developed a Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology Reporting Standards (ISLE-ReSt) Statement. The aim is to provide a checklist of recommendations to improve and make more consistent reporting of spatial lifecourse epidemiologic studies. The STrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement for cohort studies was identified as an appropriate starting point to provide initial items to consider for inclusion. Reporting standards for spatial data and methods were then integrated to form a single comprehensive checklist of reporting recommendations. The strength of our approach has been our international and multidisciplinary team of content experts and contributors who represent a wide range of relevant scientific conventions, and our adherence to international norms for the development of reporting guidelines. As spatial, location-based, and artificial intelligence technologies used in spatial lifecourse epidemiology continue to evolve at a rapid pace, it will be necessary to revisit and adapt the ISLE-ReSt at least every 2–3 years from its release. © 2019 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Exposome; Exposomics; ISLE; Lifecourse epidemiology; Location-based; Reporting guideline; Reporting standard; Spatial epidemiology; Spatial lifecourse epidemiology","Advisory Committees; Artificial Intelligence; Checklist; Cohort Studies; Epidemiologic Studies; Health Status; Humans; Internationality; Public Health; Research Design; Spatial Analysis; artificial intelligence; epidemiology; public health; technology; article; artificial intelligence; big data; checklist; cohort analysis; human; multidisciplinary team; observational study; advisory committee; epidemiology; health status; international cooperation; methodology; public health; spatial analysis","","","","","ISLE; International Initiative on Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology; Lorentz Centre; National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Birth Defects Prevention; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; UKCRC Public Health Research Centre of Excellence; West China School of Public Health in Sichuan University; Wellcome Trust, WT; United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration, UKCRC; Medical Research Council, MRC, (MC_UP_12015/6, MR/K023187/1); Medical Research Council, MRC; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; National Institute for Health Research, NIHR; British Heart Foundation, BHF; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC; Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, KNAW; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11771240, 81703279); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CCDC; Education Department of Henan Province, (ZD201905); Education Department of Henan Province; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, SKLURE, (SKLURE2018-2-5); State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, SKLURE; West China Hospital, Sichuan University, WCH; Lorentz Center, LC; National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, NHC","Funding text 1: This work was funded in part by research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11771240, 81703279), the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology of China (SKLURE2018-2-5), the National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Birth Defects Prevention, the Key Laboratory of Population Defects Intervention Technology of Henan Province (ZD201905), the Medical Research Council (MC_UP_12015/6), and the UKCRC Public Health Research Centre of Excellence.

This study is the first to address the contribution of home heating fuel and geographical course particulate matter (PM 10) concentrations to lung cancer rates in New Hampshire, USA. First, Pearson correlation analysis and geographically weighted regression were used to investigate spatial relationships between outdoor PM 10 and lung cancer rates. While the aforementioned analyses did not indicate a significant contribution of PM 10 to lung cancer in the state, there was a trend towards a significant association in the northern and southwestern regions of the state. Second, case-control data were used to estimate the contributions of indoor pollution and secondhand smoke to the risk of lung cancer with adjustment for confounders. Increased risk was found among those who used wood or coal to heat their homes for more than 10 winters before the age of 18, with a significant increase in risk per winter. Resulting data suggest that further investigation of the relationship between heating-related air pollution levels and lung cancer risk is needed. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","air pollution; coal; lung cancer; particulate matter; wood","Air Pollution; Cancers; Coal; Diseases; New Hampshire; Particulate Emissions; Pollution Control; Risk Assessment; Smoke; Vermont; Wood; New Hampshire; United States; Vermont; Air pollution; Coal; Diseases; Pollution control; Risk perception; Smoke abatement; Wood; Case-control; Geographically weighted regression; Heating fuels; Indoor pollution; lung cancer; New Hampshire; Outdoor air pollution; Particulate Matter; Pearson correlation; Pollution level; Secondhand smokes; Spatial relationships; Vermont; age class; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; cancer; coal; concentration (composition); data set; disease incidence; health risk; indoor air; particulate matter; pollution effect; respiratory disease; smoke; wood; Biological organs","","","","","Bureau of Public Health Statistics; Division of Public Health Services; New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (U58/ DP000798); National Institutes of Health, NIH","This publication was made possible by Grant Numbers LM009012, LM010098, P20RR018787, P20 RR024475, K07 CA102327, P42 ES007373 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Dietary lapses, instances of non-adherence to the recommended dietary goal(s) in lifestyle intervention, are associated with less weight loss and higher energy intake. There are distinct “types” of dietary lapse (e.g., eating an off-plan food, eating a larger portion), and behavioral, psychosocial, and contextual mechanisms may differ across dietary lapse types. Some lapse types also appear to impact weight more than others. Elucidating clear lapse types thus has potential for understanding and improving adherence to lifestyle intervention. Methods: This 18-month observational cohort study will use real-time digital assessment tools within a multi-level factor analysis framework to uncover “lapse phenotypes” and understand their impact on clinical outcomes. Adults with overweight/obesity (n = 150) will participate in a 12-month online lifestyle intervention and 6-month weight loss maintenance period. Participants will complete 14-day lapse phenotyping assessment periods at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months in which smartphone surveys, wearable devices, and geolocation will assess dietary lapses and relevant phenotyping characteristics. Energy intake (via 24-h dietary recall) and weight will be collected at each assessment period. Results: This trial is ongoing; data collection began on 31 October 2022 and is scheduled to complete by February 2027. Conclusion: Results will inform novel precision tools to improve dietary adherence in lifestyle intervention, and support updated theoretical models of adherence behavior. Additionally, these phenotyping methods can likely be leveraged to better understand non-adherence to other health behavior interventions.

In particular, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3 aims to, “by 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world”. Addressing this challenge is essential for improving the livelihoods of those most affected by DLDD and for safeguarding against the most extreme effects of climate change. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for improved monitoring of DLDD in the context of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Strategic Objective 2 (SO2) and its expected impacts: food security and adequate access to water for people in affected areas are improved; the livelihoods of people in affected areas are improved and diversified; local people, especially women and youth, are empowered and participate in decision-making processes in combating DLDD; and migration forced by desertification and land degradation is substantially reduced. While it is critical to develop methods and tools for assessing DLDD, work is needed first to provide a conceptual roadmap of the human dimensions of vulnerability in relation to DLDD, especially when attempting to create a globally standardized monitoring approach. © 2023 by the authors.","desertification, land degradation, and drought (DLDD); sustainable development goals; UNCCD Strategic Objectives","conceptual framework; desertification; drought; environmental monitoring; food security; land degradation; livelihood; nature-society relations; strategic approach; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; vulnerability","","","","","Alex Zoleff; Global Environment Facility, GEF","This research was funded by Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Grant.

It is likely, however, that most people experience climate change in situ, so understanding the role of population dynamics remains critical. How a given number of people, in a given location and with varying population characteristics may exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change or how, conversely, they may be vulnerable to climate change impacts are basic questions that remain largely unresolved [6]. This paper explores where and to what extent population dynamics intersect with high exposure to climate change. Specifically, in Eastern Africa's Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), a climate change/health vulnerability hotspot we have identified in prior research [7], we model child undernutrition vulnerability indices based on climate variables, including proxy measures (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery, at a 5-km spatial resolution. Results suggest that vegetation changes associated with precipitation decline in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa can help predict deteriorating child health. © 2016 IEEE.","Climate; Lake Victoria Basin (LVB); NDVI; stunting; undernutrition; vulnerability","East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; Climate models; Dynamics; Lakes; Population dynamics; Satellite imagery; Surveys; Climate change impact; Complex relationships; Population characteristics; Precipitation data; Socioeconomic aspects; Spatial resolution; Sub-saharan africa; Vulnerability index; child health; climate effect; health survey; NDVI; nutritional status; population dynamics; precipitation assessment; spatial analysis; vulnerability; Climate change","","","","","","","Waterlow J.C., Introduction.

Pre-existing inequalities were further intensified after the 2011 conflict which displaced over 50% of the population. This study provides an analysis of health inequalities in Syria focusing on spatial access to public hospitals and employs data from 2010, just prior to the outbreak of conflict. Establishing a preconflict snapshot of the health system could serve as a helpful baseline assessment for future studies to measure the impact of the conflict on the health system. Such information could also offer systematic data to guide postconflict reconstruction efforts. Methods We compared two methods to quantify the inpatient bed access: provider to population ratio (PPR) and two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. We compared PPR calculated at the governorate level with population weighted 2SFCA score calculated at a resolution of 2 km by 2 km. We then aggregated at the governorate level, tested multiple catchment sizes and calculated Gini coefficient for each governorate. Results We found high inequality in access to public hospitals across and within governorates, especially in the north and eastern regions, where all governorates ranked in the lowest two quintiles using both PPR and 2SFCA. Relatively small governorates in the west and the south had higher spatial access and less inequality. Testing variability in catchment size showed that even at 125 km catchment, 65% of the country had accessibility below national average. Conclusion Methodologically, the use of 2SFCA provided more nuanced insights about hospital bed allocation than PPR. 2SFCA was able to account for the cross-boundary effect and road network quality. Realistic representation of health accessibility is possible in data-scarce settings such as Syria and could be adapted to assess health access inequalities in conflict and postconflict settings.  © ","Health services administration & management; international health services; organisation of health services; public health","Catchment Area, Health; Health Facilities; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Spatial Analysis; Syria; Article; catchment area; catchment area (hydrology); geographic information system; Gini coefficient; health care access; health care facility; health care planning; health care system; health disparity; hospital service; human; Mediterranean Sea; middle income country; population; population density; population distribution; public hospital; spatial analysis; Syrian Arab Republic; health care delivery; health care facility; spatial analysis","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2CHD041020); Brown University","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements MNA is grateful to Brown University for its generous support.

However, this growth has also caused inequality of household income in developing regions. Using survey data on rural household livelihoods in Shenmu county, Shaanxi Province, in northwestern China, this paper analyzes the relationship between coal exploitation and income inequality. Four multivariate econometric analyses are developed. We find evidence for the resource curse theory of natural resource exploitation leading to inequality: the Gini coefficient for household revenue is discovered to be markedly related with the location of and participation in coal exploitation. Nevertheless, this correlation is not linear. Rather, household income inequality primitively rises with environmental and resource subsidies. We analyze the impacts of household income inequality and contrast the characteristics of household livelihood and location characteristics in the coal exploitation site of northern Shenmu with those in the whole survey site. Our statistical analysis shows that out-migration, the level of total household income, and convenience of household transportation are the important elements devoting to household income in northern Shenmu, the coal resources endowment region. However, the environmental damage and pollution caused by coal exploitation has substantial negative impacts upon household income, especially for households not participating in coal activities. Overall, we found that coal exploitation did not develop local industries. Adversely, the ecological environment problem and the high subsidy for coal mining caused by the exploitation of coal resources have aggravated the inequality of household income in the sample areas. Additionally, the development of coal resources attracted youth labor from agriculture to the coal industry, which exacerbated the lack of labor force and weakened village agricultural productivity. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","China; Shaanxi; data set; econometrics; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; household survey; income distribution","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (42061037)","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 42061037.

High resolution maps based on objective spatial units are needed to more precisely detect associations between disease and environmental factors. Method: We propose to use a Restricted and Controlled Monte Carlo (RCMC) process to disaggregate polygon-level location data to achieve mapping aggregate data at an approximated individual level. RCMC assigns a random point location to a polygon-level location, in which the randomization is restricted by the polygon and controlled by the background (e.g., population at risk). RCMC allows analytical processes designed for individual data to be applied, and generates high-resolution raster maps. Results: We applied RCMC to the town-level birth defect data for New Hampshire and generated raster maps at the resolution of 100 m. Besides the map of significance of birth defect risk represented by p-value, the output also includes a map of spatial uncertainty and a map of hot spots. Conclusions: RCMC is an effective method to disaggregate aggregate data. An RCMC-based disease mapping maximizes the use of available spatial information, and explicitly estimates the spatial uncertainty resulting from aggregation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Aggregate data; Birth defects; Disaggregation; Disease mapping; Monte Carlo; New Hampshire","Adolescent; Adult; Congenital Abnormalities; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Monte Carlo Method; New Hampshire; Topography, Medical; Young Adult; New Hampshire; United States; disease; environmental factor; mapping; Monte Carlo analysis; spatial analysis; adolescent; adult; article; birth defect; case study; disease mapping; female; geographic distribution; human; information processing; Monte Carlo method; randomization; Restricted and Controlled Monte Carlo method; United States","","","","","National Institutes of Health, (P20RO18787); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (P20ES018175); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS","","Waller L.A., Gotway C.A., Applied Spatial Statistics for Public Health Data, (2004); Cromley E.K., McLafferty S.L., GIS and Public Health, (2011); Stallones L., Nuckols J.R., Berry J.K., Surveillance around hazardous waste sites: Geographic information systems and reproductive outcomes, Environ.

In order to formulate a unified standard of establishing reference ESR values, this paper presents a novel prediction model in which local normal ESR values and corresponding geographical factors are used to predict reference ESR values using multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN). Methods and findings: Local normal ESR values were obtained from hospital data, while geographical factors that include altitude, sunshine hours, relative humidity, temperature and precipitation were obtained from the National Geographical Data Information Centre in China.The results show that predicted values are statistically in agreement with measured values. Model results exhibit significant agreement between training data and test data. Consequently, the model is used to predict the unseen local reference ESR values. Conclusions: Reference ESR values can be established with geographical factors by using artificial intelligence techniques. ANN is an effective method for simulating and predicting reference ESR values because of its ability to model nonlinear and complex relationships. © 2013 Yang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Artificial Neural Network; Back propagation; ESR; Geographical factors","Blood Sedimentation; China; Forecasting; Geography; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Reference Values; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; back propagation; blood; hospital sector; model test; model validation; performance assessment; prediction; testing method; article; artificial neural network; China; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; forecasting; geography; human; methodology; reference value","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (40971060)","The authors would like to thank Olaf Menzer, Arvis Sulovari and the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and feedback.

While government regulationsand public concern modified visitation patterns to places of interest, little research has examinedthe nuanced changes in the length of time someone spends at a place, nor theregional variability of these changes. In this work, we examine place visit duration infour major U.S. cities, identify which place types saw the largest and smallest changes,and quantify variation between cities. Furthermore, we identify socio-economic and demographicfactors that contribute to changes in visit duration and demonstrate the varyinginfluence of these factors by region. The results of our analysis indicate that the pandemic’simpact on visiting behavior varies between cities, though there are commonalities foundin certain types of places. Our findings suggest that places of interest within lower incomecommunities experienced less change in visit duration than others. An increase in the percentageof younger, Black or Hispanic populations within a community also resulted ina smaller decrease in visit duration than in other communities. These findings offer insightinto the factors that contribute to changes in visiting behavior and the resilience ofcommunities to a global pandemic. © by the author(s)","Covid-19; Pandemic; Place type; Regional variability; Time spent; Visit duration","","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering ResearchCouncil of Canada; Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University; Population Studies and Training Center at BrownUniversity; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2C HD041020); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: This research was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University (through the generosity of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P2C HD041020]).; Funding text 2: This research was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering ResearchCouncil of Canada (NSERC) and the Population Studies and Training Center at BrownUniversity (through the generosity of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute ofChild Health and Human Development [P2C HD041020]).","Benitez J., Courtemanche C., Yelowitz A., Racial and ethnic disparities in covid-19: evidence from six large cities, Journal of Economics, Race, and Policy, 3, 4, pp. 243-261, (2020); Chande A., Lee S., Harris M., Nguyen Q., Beckett S.

Such understanding can help local governors make better policies to enhance county attractivity and attract more migrants for regional development. In this study, the county-scale relative intrinsic attractivity (RIA) of Guangdong Province is computed using the number of migrants and the corresponding distances between origins and destinations. The results show that the RIA has a higher positive correlation with the flows of migrants to destination and demonstrates an obvious phenomenon of distance decay. The RIA decreases faster when the distance between origins and destinations increases. Spatially, the RIA reveals a core-periphery belt pattern in Guangdong Province. The center of the Pearl River Delta is the highest core of RIA and the outside areas of the delta represent the low-RIA belt. The highest RIA is 6811 in Dongguan City and the lowest RIA is 1 in Yangshan County. The core area includes Dongguan, Shenzhen City and the southern regions of Guangzhou, Foshan and Zhongshan City where the RIA value is higher than 1000. The second belt is mainly composed of the periphery districts of the Pearl River Delta, which include Shunde, Nanhai, Luohu, Tianhe Huicheng, Panyu, Haizhu, Huiyang, Huadu, Yuexiu, Xiangzhou and the Yuexiu, Huangpu and Boluo, where the RIA values are higher than 100 and lower than 1000. The third belt includes the western wing, eastern wing and northern area. Most of these RIA values range from 1 to 2. In this belt, there are three areas with relatively higher RIA attractivity scattered in the ring: the downtowns of Zhanjiang City, Chaozhou and Shantou Cities and Shaoguan City. The areas farther away from the core have a lower RIA score. Determinants analysis indicates that the RIA is positively determined by destination economic development level, social service and living standard level and destination population quality. A region will be more attractive if it has higher per capital GDP, tertiary industry level, investment and number of industrial enterprises involved in economic development. A region with a high annual average wage of employees and high social service and living standards will be more attractive, while a region with low destination population quality, including aspects such as the adult illiteracy rate, will be less attractive. © 2019 by the authors.","Core-periphery belt pattern; Determinants analysis; Guangdong Province; Relative intrinsic attractivity; Ridge regression; Spatial distribution","China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; core-periphery relations; correlation; economic development; living standard; migration; regression analysis; spatial distribution; statistical analysis; tourist destination","","","","","National Social Science Foundation of China, (14BRK017); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41501152); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding: This research was funded by National Social Science Foundation of China (No: 14BRK017) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No: 41501152).","Parrado E., Kandel W., Industrial change, his-panic immigration and the internal migration of low-skilled native male workers in the united states, 1995-2000, Soc.

We estimate the associations between in-utero and perinatal exposure to PM2.5 and infant, neonatal and postneonatal mortality in India. We evaluate the sensitivity of this association to two widely-used exposure assessments. Method: We linked nationally representative anthropometric data from India's 2015–2016 Demographic and Health Survey (n = 259,627 children under five across 640 districts of India) with satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations during the month of birth of each child. We then estimated the associations between PM2.5 from each dataset and child mortality, after controlling for child, mother and household factors including trends in time and seasonality. We examined if factors: urban/rural, sex, wealth quintile and state modified the associations derived from the two datasets using Wald tests. Results: We found evidence that PM2.5 impacts infant mortality primarily through neonatal mortality. The estimated association between neonatal mortality and PM2.5 in trimester 3 was OR: 1.016 (95% CI: 1.003, 1.030) for every 10 μg/m3 increase in exposure. This association was robust to the exposure assessment used. Child sex was a significant effect modifier, with PM2.5 impacting mortality in infant girls more than boys. Conclusions: Our results revealed a robust association between ambient exposure to PM2.5 in the latter period of pregnancy and early life with infant and neonatal mortality in India. Urgent air pollution management plans are needed to improve infant mortality in India. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Demographic and Health Survey (DHS); India; Infant mortality; Neonatal mortality","Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; India; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Male; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy; India; Air pollution; Anthropometry; Health; Surveys; Air pollution mortality; Ambient air pollution; Ambients; Demographic and health survey; Exposure assessment; Health surveys; India; Infant mortality; Neonatal mortality; PM 2.5; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health impact; health risk; infant mortality; particulate matter; public health; ambient air; article; child; childhood mortality; controlled study; demography; female; health survey; household; human; India; infant; infant mortality; major clinical study; male; newborn mortality; PM2.5 exposure; pregnancy; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; epidemiology; India; infant mortality; newborn; particulate matter; Population statistics","","Air Pollutants, ; Particulate Matter, ","","","Central Pollution Control Board; Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2C HD041020); Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, IIITD; Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, MoEFCC","Funding text 1: KM acknowledges support from the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University through the generosity of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( P2C HD041020 ). ; Funding text 2: SD acknowledges support from IIT Delhi for the Institute Chair position.

Despite the geospatial nature of clinic transfers, there exist limited data on the geospatial trends of clinic transfers to guide intervention development. In this study, we investigate the geospatial characteristics and trends of clinic transfers among PLWH on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Design Retrospective spatial analysis. Setting PLWH who initiated ART treatment between 2012 and 2016 in South Africa's Western Cape Province were followed from ART initiation to their last visit prior to 2017. Deidentified electronic medical records from all public clinical, pharmacy, and laboratory visits in the Western Cape were linked across space and time using a unique patient identifier number. Participants 4176 ART initiators in South Africa (68% women). Methods We defined a clinic transfer as any switch between health facilities that occurred on different days and measured the distance between facilities using geodesic distance. We constructed network flow maps to evaluate geospatial trends in clinic transfers over time, both for individuals' first transfer and overall. Results Two-thirds of ART initiators transferred health facilities at least once during follow-up. Median distance between all clinic transfer origins and destinations among participants was 8.6 km. Participant transfers were heavily clustered around Cape Town. There was a positive association between time on ART and clinic transfer distance, both among participants' first transfers and overall. Conclusion This study is among the first to examine geospatial trends in clinic transfers over time among PLWH. Our results make clear that clinic transfers are common and can cluster in urban areas, necessitating better integrated health information systems and HIV care.  © ","epidemiology; epidemiology; HIV & AIDS","Ambulatory Care Facilities; Anti-HIV Agents; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; South Africa; Spatial Analysis; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; antiretroviral therapy; art therapy; article; electronic medical record; female; follow up; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; male; medical information system; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; South Africa; spatial analysis; urban area; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; outpatient department; retrospective study; South Africa; spatial analysis","","Anti-HIV Agents, ","","","Providence/Boston Center for AIDS Research, (P30AI042853); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (D43TW011308-01); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R00MH112413); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; Fogarty International Center, FIC; Brown University; South African Medical Research Council, SAMRC, (R01 MH106600); South African Medical Research Council, SAMRC","Funding This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the South African Medical Research Council (R01 MH106600) as well as the Fogarty International Center at the NIH (D43TW011308-01).
