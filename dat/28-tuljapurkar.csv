The diversity in rates of aging observed in nature suggests that the rate at which age-specific selection weakens is determined by species-specific ecological factors. We propose that, in iteroparous species, relationships between parental age, offspring birth order, and environment may affect selection on senescence. Later-born siblings have, on average, older parents than do first borns. Offspring born to older parents may experience different environments in terms of family support or inherited resources, factors often mediated by competition from siblings. Thus, age-specific selection on parents may change if the environment produces birth-order related gradients in reproductive success. We use an age-and-stage structured population model to investigate the impact of sibling environmental inequality on the expected evolution of senescence. We show that accelerated senescence evolves when later-born siblings are likely to experience an environment detrimental to lifetime reproduction. In general, sibling inequality is likely to be of particular importance for the evolution of senescence in species such as humans, where family interactions and resource inheritance have important roles in determining lifetime reproduction. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Demography; Ecology; Evolution; Inequality; Inheritance; Life history","Aging; Birth Order; Genetic Fitness; Humans; Models, Genetic; Selection, Genetic; Siblings; demography; Ecology; evolution; inequality; inheritance; life history; aging; demography; human evolution; life history; natural selection; population modeling; reproductive potential; reproductive success; senescence; survival; aging; article; biological model; birth order; demography; ecology; evolution; genetic selection; human; inequality; inheritance; life history; reproductive fitness; sibling","","","","","National Institutes of Health, (AG039345, AG22500); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R24AG039345)","","Anderton D.L., Tsuya N.O., Bean L.L., Mineau G.P., Intergenerational transmission of relative fertility and life course patterns, Demography, 24, pp. 467-480, (1987); Borgerhoff-Mulder M., Beheim B.A., Understanding the nature of wealth and its effects on human fitness, Philos.

However, machine learning, used elsewhere in the biomedical literature, has not been extensively applied to study relationships between society and health. We investigate how machine learning may add to our understanding of social determinants of health using data from the Health and Retirement Study. Methods A linear regression of age and gender, and a parsimonious theory-based regression additionally incorporating income, wealth, and education, were used to predict systolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and telomere length. Prediction, fit, and interpretability were compared across four machine learning methods: linear regression, penalized regressions, random forests, and neural networks. Results All models had poor out-of-sample prediction. Most machine learning models performed similarly to the simpler models. However, neural networks greatly outperformed the three other methods. Neural networks also had good fit to the data (R2 between 0.4–0.6, versus <0.3 for all others). Across machine learning models, nine variables were frequently selected or highly weighted as predictors: dental visits, current smoking, self-rated health, serial-seven subtractions, probability of receiving an inheritance, probability of leaving an inheritance of at least $10,000, number of children ever born, African-American race, and gender. Discussion Some of the machine learning methods do not improve prediction or fit beyond simpler models, however, neural networks performed well. The predictors identified across models suggest underlying social factors that are important predictors of biological indicators of chronic disease, and that the non-linear and interactive relationships between variables fundamental to the neural network approach may be important to consider. © 2017 The Authors","Biomarkers; Health and retirement study; Machine learning; Neural network; Social determinants of health","African American; Article; artificial neural network; body mass; chronic disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; dental visit; education; female; health care concepts; health status; human; income; learning algorithm; linear regression analysis; machine learning; male; nonlinear system; number of children ever born; parsimonious theory based regression; penalized regression; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; probability of leaving an inheritance; probability of receiving an inheritance; race difference; random forest; regression analysis; self report; sex difference; smoking; social aspect; social determinants of health; statistical model; systolic blood pressure; telomere length; waist circumference","","","","","Center for the Study of Aging; Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R24AG039345); U.S. Social Security Administration, SSA","Funding text 1: This study was supported by NIA grant R24AG039345 .

Understanding the evolution of life histories requires an assessment of the process that generates variation in life histories. Within-population heterogeneity of life histories can be dynamically generated by stochastic variation of reproduction and survival or be generated by individual differences that are fixed at birth. 2. We show for the kittiwake that dynamic heterogeneity is a sufficient explanation of observed variation of life histories. 3. The total heterogeneity in life histories has a small contribution fromreproductive stage dynamics and a large contribution from survival differences. We quantify the diversity in life histories by metrics computed fromthe generating stochastic process. 4. We show how dynamic heterogeneity can be used as a null model and also how it can lead to positive associations between reproduction and survival across the life span. 5. We believe our approach to identifying the nature of among-individual heterogeneity yields important insights into the forces that generate within-population variation of life-history traits. It provides an alternative to claims that fixed individual differences are a major determinant of heterogeneity in life histories. ©2009 The Authors.

Available methods for the analysis of effects of vital rates on lifespan in stage-structured models have not been widely applied because they are hard to use and interpret, and tools for age and stage structured populations are missing. We present easily interpretable expressions for the sensitivities and elasticities of life expectancy to vital rates in age-stage models, and illustrate their application with two biological examples. Much of our approach relies on trading of time and mortality risk in one stage for time and risk in others. Our approach contributes to the new framework of the study of age- and stage-structured biodemography. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Age-stage structure; Life history evolution; Markov chain process; Multi-state models; Perturbation analysis; Survival","Aging; Animals; Anseriformes; Life Expectancy; Markov Chains; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Survival Rate; age; article; demography; developmental stage; evolution; life expectancy; life history; maturation; mortality; nonhuman; population structure; priority journal; probability; statistical analysis; statistical model; survival rate; time","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (Marie‐Curie PIEF‐GA‐2009‐235205, P01‐AG0225000‐01, R24AG039345); National Institute on Aging, NIA","We were supported by NIA P01‐AG0225000‐01 and Marie‐Curie PIEF‐GA‐2009‐235205 .

We do not understand why species achieve the sizes they do, and this means we also do not understand the circumstances under which gigantism or dwarfism is selected. We develop size-structured integral projection models to explore evolution of body size and life history speed. We make few assumptions and keep models simple: all functions remain constant across models except for the one that describes development of body size with age. We set sexual maturity to occur when size attains 80% of the asymptotic size, which is typical of a large mammal, and allow negative density dependence to only affect either reproduction or juvenile survival. Fitness – the quantity that is maximized by adaptive evolution – is carrying capacity in our models, and we are consequently interested in how it changes with size at sexual maturity, and how this association varies with development rate. The simple models generate complex dynamics while providing insight into the circumstances when extremes of body size evolve. The direction of selection leading to either gigantism or dwarfism crucially depends on the proportion of the population that is sexually mature, which in turn depends on how the development function determines the survivorship schedule. The developmental trajectories consequently interact with size-specific survival or reproductive rates to determine the best life history and the optimal body size emerges from that interaction. These dynamics result in trade-offs between different components of the life history, with the form of the trade-off that emerges depending upon where in the life history density dependence operates most strongly. Empirical application of the approach we develop has potential to help explain the enigma of body size variation across the tree of life. © 2022, Centre Mersenne.

Generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions describe most ecologically relevant extreme events, including hurricanes, wildfires, and disease spread. In climate science, the GEV is widely used as an accurate and flexible tool over large spatial scales (>105 km2) to study how changes in climate shift extreme events. However, ecologists rarely use the GEV to study how climate change affects populations. Here we show how to estimate a GEV for hurricanes at an ecologically relevant (<103 km2) spatial scale, and use the results in a stochastic, empirically based, matrix population model. As a case study, we use an understory shrub in southeast Florida, USA with hurricane-driven dynamics and measure the effects of change using the stochastic population growth rate. We use sensitivities to analyze how population growth rate is affected by changes in hurricane frequency and intensity, canopy damage levels, and canopy recovery rates. Our results emphasize the importance of accurately estimating location-specific storm frequency. In a rapidly changing world, our methods show how to combine realistic extreme event and population models to assess ecological impacts and to prioritize conservation actions for at-risk populations. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","climate change; downscaling; extreme climatic events; generalized extreme value distributions; hurricanes; stochastic population models","Climate Change; Ecosystem; Florida; Population Dynamics; Florida [United States]; United States; climate change; climate effect; downscaling; extreme event; growth rate; hurricane event; population growth; population modeling; shrub; stochasticity; storm damage; understory; climate change; ecosystem; Florida; population dynamics","","","","","Abbott Laboratories","We thank Tadashi Fukami, Tim Coulson, Thomas Jagger, Karen Abbott, Roberto Salguero-Gomez, and an anonymous reviewer for their feedback on the manuscript.

These models are special cases of stage-structured population models. We show that stage-structured models generate dynamic heterogeneity: life-history differences produced by stochastic stratum dynamics. We characterize dynamic heterogeneity in a range of species across taxa by properties of the Markov chain: the entropy, which describes the extent of heterogeneity, and the subdominant eigenvalue, which describes the persistence of reproductive success during the life of an individual. Trajectories of reproductive stage determine survivorship, and we analyse the variance in lifespan within and between trajectories of reproductive stage. We show how stage-structured models can be used to predict realized distributions of lifetime reproductive success. Dynamic heterogeneity contrasts with fixed heterogeneity: unobserved differences that generate variation between life histories. We show by an example that observed distributions of lifetime reproductive success are often consistent with the claim that little or no fixed heterogeneity influences this trait. We propose that dynamic heterogeneity provides a 'neutral' model for assessing the possible role of unobserved 'quality' differences between individuals. We discuss fitness for dynamic life histories, and the implications of dynamic heterogeneity for the evolution of life histories and senescence. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Capture-mark-recapture; Dynamic heterogeneity; Entropy; Fixed heterogeneity; Frailty; Life history; Multistage model; Reproductive strata; Senescence; Survival-reproduction tradeoff","Age Factors; Aging; Animals; Evolution; Markov Chains; Models, Biological; Mortality; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Selection (Genetics); Species Specificity; ecological modeling; evolution; heterogeneity; life history; Markov chain; reproductive success; senescence; stochasticity; survival; age; aging; animal; biological model; evolution; genetic selection; mortality; physiology; population dynamics; probability; reproduction; review; species difference","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG022500)","","Brownie C., Hines J.E., Nichols J.D., Pollock K.H., Hestbeck J.B., Capture-recapture studies for multiple strata including non-Markovian transitions, Biometrics, 49, pp. 1173-1187, (1993); Cam E., Monnat J.Y., Stratification based on reproductive state reveals contrasting patterns of age-related variation in demographic parameters in the kittiwake, Oikos, 90, pp. 560-574, (2000); Cam E., Link W.A., Cooch E.G., Monnat J.Y., Danchin E., Individual covariation in life-history traits: Seeing the trees despite the forest, Am.

Here, composition refers to the component structure of the population, for example into distinct age classes. The formal theory of population cycles consists of mathematical tools that yield qualitative and quantitative information about the characteristics of cycles, such as their amplitude or period. There are three broad types of cycle: transient cycles are a response to a perturbation of finite duration such as a fertility transition; externally driven cycles are triggered and sustained by a persistent external perturbation such as an economic cycle, internally driven cycles are maintained by interactions within the population such as a feedback between cohort size and cohort fertility. This article discusses the theory for these three types of cycles, dealing mainly with age-structured populations, although other aspects of population structure are mentioned. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study examines the impact of racial-ethnic majority composition on mortality and how this relationship varies across different levels of economic concentration in neighborhoods, as defined by census tracts. Premature death rates (under 65 years of age) were retrieved from abridged period life tables from 67,140 U.S. census tracts derived from the U.S. Small-area Life Expectancy Project. Covariate factors were retrieved from the 2011–2015 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. We measured racial-ethnic concentration by grouping neighborhoods using each tract’s majority racial-ethnic group, and approximated income concentration using the Index of Concentration of the Extremes. We used three-level random intercept models to examine the interaction of racial-ethnic and income concentration and its association with neighborhood mortality risk, accounting for covariates. Our study yielded three salient findings. First, mortality risk varied greatly in poor neighborhoods with different racial-ethnic compositions compared to affluent neighborhoods, with notable higher risk in Black-majority areas. Second, in diverse neighborhoods where no single ethnic group forms a majority—referred to as Minority-majority neighborhoods—the mortality risk is comparable to that in White-majority neighborhoods. Third, Hispanic/Latino- and Asian-majority neighborhoods had lower mortality risk than White-majority neighborhoods in areas with a high concentration of poverty, but similar mortality risk in affluent areas. The study suggests that racial-ethnic and socioeconomic area-based measures are important to consider together to address mortality inequities accurately. © W.

Another source of randomness arises when these probabilities also change over time in variable environments. For structured populations in stochastic environments, we extend our recent method to determine how birth environment and birth stage determine the random distribution of the LRS. Our results provide a null model that quantifies effects on LRS of just the birth size or stage. Using Roe deer Capreolus capreolus as a case study, we show that the effect of an individual's birth environment on LRS varies with the frequency of environments and their temporal autocorrelation, and that lifetime performance is affected by changes in the pattern of environmental states expected as a result of climate change. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","autocorrelation; environmental stochasticity; lifetime reproductive success; silver spoon effects; state frequency","Animals; Climate Change; Deer; Reproduction; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; animal; climate change; deer; reproduction","","","","","","","Barker D.J.P., Fetal origins of coronary heart disease, BMJ, 311, 6998, pp. 171-174, (1995); Berger V., Lemaitre J.-F., Allaine D., Gaillard J.-M., Cohas A., Early and adult social environments have independent effects on individual fitness in a social vertebrate, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 282, 1813, (2015); Briga M., Et al., Food availability affects adult survival trajectories depending on early developmental conditions, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 284, 1846, (2017); Brommer J., Gustafsson L., Pietiainen H., Merila J., Single-generation estimates of individual fitness as proxies for long-term genetic contribution, The American Naturalist, 163, 4, pp. 505-517, (2004); Brown D., Alexander N., The analysis of the variance and covariance of products, Biometrics, 47, 2, pp. 429-444, (1991); Buston P.M., Elith J., Determinants of reproductive success in dominant pairs of clownfish: a boosted regression tree analysis, Journal of Animal Ecology, 80, 3, pp. 528-538, (2011); Cartwright S., Nicoll M., Jones C., Tatayah V., Norris K., Anthropogenic natal environmental effects on life histories in a wild bird population, Current Biology, 24, 5, pp. 536-540, (2014); Caswell H., Beyond R0: demographic models for variability of lifetime reproductive output, PLoS One, 6, 6, (2011); Catton H.A., Michener G.R., Cohort effects and proximal versus distal metrics for lifetime reproductive success in Richardson’s ground squirrels, Journal of Mammalogy, 97, 3, pp. 774-787, (2016); Clutton-Brock T.H., Reproductive success: studies of individual variation in contrasting breeding systems, (1988); Cohen J.E., Ergodicity of age structure in populations with Markovian vital rates, III: finite-state moments and growth rate; an illustration, Advances in Applied Probability, 9, 3, pp. 462-475, (1977); Cooper E.B., Kruuk L.E.B., Ageing with a silverspoon: A meta-analysis of the effect of developmental environment on senescence, Evolution Letters, 2, 5, pp. 460-471, (2018); Descamps S., Boutin S., Berteaux D., McAdam A.G., Gaillard J.-M., Cohort effects in red squirrels: the influence of density, food abundance and temperature on future survival and reproductive success, Journal of Animal Ecology, 77, 2, pp. 305-314, (2008); Douhard M., Festa-Bianchet M., Landes J., Pelletier F., Trophy hunting mediates sex-specific associations between earlylife environmental conditions and adult mortality in bighorn sheep, Journal of Animal Ecology, 88, 5, pp. 734-745, (2019); Douhard M., Plard F., Gaillard J.-M., Capron G., Delorme D., Klein F., Et al., Fitness consequences of environmental conditions at different life stages in a long-lived vertebrate, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 281, 1785, (2014); Ellner S., Childs D., Rees M., Data-driven Modelling of Structured Populations: A Practical Guide to the Integral Projection Model, (2016); Gaillard J.-M., Boutin J.-M., Delorme D., Van Laere G., Duncan P., Lebreton J.-D., Early survival in roe deer: causes and consequences of cohort variation in two contrasted populations, Oecologia, 112, 4, pp. 502-513, (1997); Gaillard J.-M., Mark Hewison A., Klein F., Plard F., Douhard M., Davison R., Et al., How does climate change influence demographic processes of widespread species?

These large deviations from average environmental conditions have strong impacts on ecosystems, exposing organisms to more severe conditions for longer periods of time than previously seen before. Many ECEs are well described by the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The GEV has a long history as an accurate model across disciplines, including hydrology, finance, civil engineering, and climate science. Although the GEV is often used by climate scientists to characterize ECEs, such as hurricanes and floods, it is rarely included in ecological models. Furthermore, climate scientists typically model ECEs on large spatial scales (≫105 km2) whereas ecologically relevant spatial scales are often much smaller (e.g., <103 km2). Here, we demonstrate how to estimate a GEV for ECEs and “downscale” the model to an ecologically relevant spatial scale. We then show how to shift the GEV to account for climate change predictions and incorporate the GEV into ecological population models. The GEV is a flexible tool to model ECEs across event types and ecosystems. We discuss the implications and challenges of accurately modeling ECEs and quantitatively estimating their impacts on ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Ecology; Extreme climatic events; Generalized extreme value distribution","","","","","","","","Alexander L.V., Zhang X., Peterson T.C., Caesar J., Gleason B., Klein Tank A.M.G., Haylock M., Collins D., Trewin B., Rahimzadeh F., Tagipour A., Rupa Kumar K., Revadekar J., Griffiths G., Vincent L., Stephenson D.B., Burn J., Aguilar E., Brunet M., Taylor M., New M., Zhai P., Rusticucci M., Vazquez-Aguirre J.L., Global observed changes in daily climate extremes of temperature and precipitation, J.

We develop a new framework for incorporating trait-mediated density-dependence into size-structured models and use Trinidadian guppies to show how different types of competitive interactions impact life history parameters. Our results show the degree of symmetry in competitive interactions can have dramatic effects on the speed of the life history. For some vital rates, shifting the competitive superiority from small to large individuals resulted in a doubling of the generation time. Such large influences of competitive symmetry on the timescale of demographic processes, and hence evolution, highlights the interwoven nature of ecological and evolutionary processes and the importance of density-dependence in understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.","Asymmetrical competition; Contest competition; Integral projection model; Interaction surface; Mesocosm; Scramble competition; Symmetrical competition","Animals; Competitive Behavior; Female; Models, Biological; Poecilia; Population Dynamics; asymmetric competition; contest competition; demography; density dependence; life history trait; mesocosm; reproductive success; scramble competition; size structure; symmetry; teleost; animal; biological model; competitive behavior; female; physiology; Poecilia; population dynamics","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Biological Sciences, BIO, (0623632); Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/I022027/1, NE/K014048/1)","","Adler P.B., Ellner S.P., Levine J.M., Coexistence of perennial plants: an embarrassment of niches, Ecol.

There is a growing number of empirical reports of environmental change simultaneously influencing population dynamics, life history and quantitative characters. We do not have a well-developed understanding of links between the dynamics of these quantities. 2. Insight into the joint dynamics of populations, quantitative characters and life history can be gained by deriving a model that allows the calculation of fundamental quantities that underpin population ecology, evolutionary biology and life history. The parameterization and analysis of such a model for a specific system can be used to predict how a population will respond to environmental change. 3. Age-stage-structured models can be constructed from character-demography associations that describe age-specific relationships between the character and: (i) survival; (ii) fertility; (iii) ontogenetic development of the character among survivors; and (iv) the distribution of reproductive allocation. 4. These models can be used to calculate a wide range of useful biological quantities including population growth and structure; terms in the Price equation including selection differentials; estimates of biometric heritabilities; and life history descriptors including generation time. We showcase the method through parameterization of a model using data from a well-studied population of Soay sheep Ovis aries. 5. Perturbation analysis is used to investigate how the quantities listed in summary point 4 change as each parameter in each character-demography function is altered. 6. A wide range of joint dynamics of life history, quantitative characters and population growth can be generated in response to changes in different character-demography associations; we argue this explains the diversity of observations on the consequences of environmental change from studies of free-living populations. 7. The approach we describe has the potential to explain within and between species patterns in quantitative characters, life history and population dynamics. © 2010 The Authors.

To understand how stage variation affects dynamics and evolution, it is essential to extend age-only demography to stage-and-age demography. We summarize here stage-plus-age demographic theory. The analysis we describe uses discrete time and applies to discrete and/or continuous stage variables, and relies on the extension of matrix methods that were first developed for age-only demography.

These measures are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest. However, the relationship between size, age, and life expectancy is poorly understood. In this paper, we show how to obtain, in a dynamic environment, age-related population parameters from data on size and light transitions and survival of individuals over single time steps. We accomplish this goal by combining two types of analysis (integral projection modeling and age-from-stage analysis for variable environments) in a new way. The method uses an index of crown illumination (CI) to capture the key tree life-history axis of movement through the light environment. We use this method to analyze data on nine tropical tree species, chosen to sample two main gradients, juvenile recruitment niche (gap/nongap) and adult crown position niche (subcanopy, canopy-emergent). We validate the method using independent estimates of age and size from growth rings and 14C from some of the same species at the same site and use our results to examine correlations among age-related population parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new results for life histories of tropical trees. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Age; Costa Rica; Crown illumination index; Environmental stochasticity; Integral projection model; La selva; Light; Markov chains; Mortality trajectory; Remaining life expectancy; Size structure; Tropical trees","Ecosystem; Light; Markov Chains; Models, Biological; Time Factors; Trees; Tropical Climate; Central America; Costa Rica; Heredia; La Selva; correlation; data acquisition; estimation method; forest canopy; juvenile; life expectancy; life history; mortality; parameterization; population density; population structure; rainforest; size structure; species diversity; survivorship; theoretical study; tree ring; tropical forest; article; biological model; ecosystem; light; physiology; probability; time; tree; tropic climate","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG022500); National Institute on Aging, NIA","","Adler P., HilleRisLambers J., Levine J.M., A niche for neutrality, Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 95-104, (2006); Alvarez-Buylla E.R., Martinez-Ramos M., Demography and allometry of Cecropia obtusifolia, a neotropical pioneer tree: An evaluation of the climax-pioneer paradigm for tropical rain forests, Journal of Ecology, 80, pp. 275-290, (1992); Baker P., Tree age estimation for the tropics: A test fromthe southern Appalachians, Ecological Applications, 13, pp. 1718-1732, (2003); Bazzaz F., Plants in Changing Environments: Linking Physiological, Population and Community Ecology, (1996); Caswell H., Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis and Interpretation.

We demonstrate that this link arises because both the birth and death rates depend on the variance of age-at-death. This bears the prospect to separate the influences of the age patterns of fertility and mortality on population growth rate. Here, we show how the age pattern of death affects population growth. Using this insight we derive a new approximation of the population growth rate that uses the first and second moments of the age-at-death distribution. We apply our new approximation to 46 mammalian life tables (including humans) and show that it is on par with the most prominent other approximations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Euler-Lotka-equation; Life history; Mortality senescence; Net maternity; Reproductive senescence; Stable age distribution","Age Factors; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Population Growth; Mammalia; age class; age structure; fertility; growth rate; life history; life table; mortality; population distribution; population growth; age; article; human; mortality; population growth; theoretical model","","","","","ERC Advanced; US NIA, (P01 AG022500); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG022500); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","We thank three anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

We used individual-based data from a population of Soay sheep to examine variation in life-history strategies at high and low population density. We incorporated life-history trade-offs among survival, reproduction and body mass growth into structured population models and found support for the prediction that different life-history strategies are optimal at low and high population densities. Shorter generation times and lower asymptotic body mass were selected for in high-density environments even though heavier individuals had higher probabilities to survive and reproduce. In contrast, greater asymptotic body mass and longer generation times were optimal at low population density. If populations fluctuate between high density when resources are scarce, and low densities when they are abundant, the variation in density will generate fluctuating selection for different life-history strategies, that could act to maintain life-history variation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","density dependence; evolution; IPM; K-selection; life history; life-history trade-offs; population dynamics; r-selection; Soay sheep; stochasticity","Animals; Biological Evolution; Life History Traits; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Sheep; Ovis aries; Ungulata; animal; evolution; life history trait; population density; population dynamics; reproduction; sheep","","","","","Royal Society","We thank the Soay sheep project, all collectors of field data, and particularly Josephine Pemberton, Tim Clutton-Brock and Loeske Kruuk.

We revisit the model's predictive ability and trends in mortality decline among developed nations since the end of the Cold War. OBJECTIVE To understand the predictive power of the Lee-Carter model with mortality trends since 1990. METHODS Mortality data were obtained from the Human Mortality Database. Forecasts were made using R with random walk forecasts using the package forecast. RESULTS While Lee-Carter forecasts of life expectancy for combined sexes were accurate, sexspecific forecasts tended to somewhat overestimate for females and significantly underestimate for males. Further investigation of the trend for males shows that the first singular value continues to capture the majority of the variation in mortality since 1990, with progress along this dimension moving at a constant rate. CONCLUSIONS Lee-Carter forecasts have significantly underestimated gains inmale life expectancy without major changes to the model's assumptions. We believe this represents more rapid progress in tackling male mortality in the G7 countries without major changes to the age pattern of these gains. Curiously, this has not affected combined-sex forecasts, potentially being offset by slight overestimation of female mortality progress. CONTRIBUTION We show that the Lee-Carter model has made inaccurate forecasts of mortality rates unrelated to violations of its underlying assumptions. © 2016 Seligman, Greenberg & Tuljapurkar.","","","","","","","","","Armstrong G.L., Conn L.A., Pinner R.W., Trends in infectious disease mortality in the United States during the 20th century, Journal of the American Medical Association, 281, 1, pp. 61-66, (1999); Gouni-Berthold I., Berthold H.K., Mantzoros C.S., Bohm M., Krone W., Sex disparities in the treatment and control of cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes, Diabetes Care, 31, 7, pp. 1389-1391, (2008); Hyndman R.J., Booth H., Yasmeen F., Coherent mortality forecasting: The product-ratio method with functional time series models, Demography, 50, 1, pp. 261-283, (2013); Hyndman R.J., Khandakar Y., Automatic time series forecasting: The forecast package for R, Journal of Statistical Software, 27, 3, pp. 1-22, (2008); Lee R., The Lee-Carter method for forecasting mortality, with various extensions and applications, North American Actuarial Journal, 4, 1, pp. 80-93, (1999); Lee R.D., Carter L.R., Modeling and forecasting U.S. mortality, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 87, 419, pp. 659-671, (1992); Levi F., Trends in mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Europe and other areas of the world, Heart, 88, 2, pp. 119-124, (2002); Li N., Gerland P., Modifying the Lee-Carter method to project mortality changes up to 2100, (2012); Li N., Lee R., Gerland P., Extending the Lee-Carter method to model the rotation of age patterns of mortality decline for long-term projections, Demography, 50, 6, pp. 2037-2051, (2013); Li N., Lee R.D., Coherent mortality forecasts for a group of populations: An extension of the Lee-Carter method, Demography, 42, 3, pp. 575-594, (2005); Olshansky S.J., Ault A.B., The fourth stage of the epidemiologic transition: The age of delayed degenerative diseases, The Milbank Quarterly, 64, 3, pp. 355-391, (1986); Omran A.R., The epidemiologic transition: A theory of the epidemiology of population change, The Milbank Quarterly, 49, 4, pp. 509-538, (1971); Parikh N.I., Gona P., Larson M.G., Fox C.S., Benjamin E.J., Murabito J.M., O'Donnell C.J., Vasan R.S., Levy D., Long-term trends in myocardial infarction incidence and case fatality in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Framingham Heart study, Circulation, 119, 9, pp. 1203-1210, (2009); Preston S., Heuveline P., Guillot M., Demography: Measuring and modeling population processes, (2001); Preston S.H., Keyfitz N., Schoen R., Causes of death: life tables for national population, (1972); Preston S.H., Wang H., Sex mortality differences in the United States: The role of cohort smoking patterns, Demography, 43, 4, pp. 631-646, (2006); R: A language and environment for statistical computing, (2012); Roger V.L., Weston S.A., Gerber Y., Killian J.M., Dunlay S.M., Jaffe A.S., Bell M.R., Kors J., Yawn B.P., Jacobsen S.J., Trends in incidence, severity, and outcome of hospitalized myocardial infarction, Circulation, 121, 7, pp. 863-869, (2010); (2012); Report to the Social Security Advisory Board, (2011); Tuljapurkar S., Li N., Boe C., A universal pattern of mortality decline in the G7 countries, Nature, 405, 6788, pp. 789-792, (2000); Human mortality database; Vaccarino V., Rathore S.S., Wenger N.K., Frederick P.D., Abramson J.L., Barron H.V., Manhapra A., Mallik S., Krumholz H.M., Sex and racial differences in the management of acute myocardial infarction, 1994 through 2002, New England Journal of Medicine, 353, 7, pp. 671-682, (2005); Wang H., Preston S.H., Forecasting United States mortality using cohort smoking histories, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 106, 2, pp. 393-398, (2009)","B.

We used singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant trajectories of life cycle gene expression variation, performed pairwise comparisons of stage and age differences in gene expression across the life cycle, identified when genes exhibited maximum levels of life cycle gene expression, and assessed population and host cactus effects on gene expression. Life cycle SVD analysis returned four significant components of transcriptional variation, revealing functional enrichment of genes responsible for growth, metabolic function, sensory perception, neural function, translation and ageing. Host cactus effects on female gene expression revealed population- and stage-specific differences, including significant host plant effects on larval metabolism and development, as well as adult neurotransmitter binding and courtship behaviour gene expression levels. In 3- to 6-day-old virgin females, significant upregulation of genes associated with meiosis and oogenesis was accompanied by downregulation of genes associated with somatic maintenance, evidence for a life history trade-off.

For the island populations of Polynesia, Kirch (1984, 1994) provides a synthetic summary and model of demographic and cultural evolution over a millennium. This synthesis frames history in a temporal demographic sequence: Founding immigrants begin a period of exponential numerical increase in time and of spatial spread; then follows a confrontation with Malthusian limits that is manifest in expansion into marginal areas and in the slowing or cessation of population increase; the latter period is marked by the evolution of sociocultural hierarchies in the form of chiefdoms. This temporal story rests on assumptions concerning the relationship between agriculture and long-run population dynamics, including the productivity of agriculture in prehistory, the nature of marginal areas, Malthusian limits, and carrying capacity. This chapter examines these and related concepts from demographic, ecological, and comparative perspectives. First, we examine briefl y and critically Malthusian limits and carrying capacity, followed by the concepts of marginal areas and sustainability. Second, we consider the problem of demographic reconstruction based on the limited data available for prehistoric populations. We present a new data-driven method that uses data tabulated by Weiss (1973) on various prehistoric populations to generate a new family of model life tables. The success of this approach suggests that we may be able to reduce reliance on mortality models for contemporary populations. Finally, we discuss an ecologically based approach to the interaction between agricultural practices and soil dynamics. Sowing, fertilizing, and cropping alter the cycle of nutrient fl ow from the atmosphere and the soil into plants and back again. We propose a quantitative model of this cycle and its dynamics and discuss its use in studying the relationship between agriculture and demography in prehistory. We argue that such an approach can provide robust insights into the dynamic processes that underlie population change and population-environment relationships in prehistory. © 2007 by University of Hawai'i Press.

The probability of such loss is the extinction probability of an individual with a random lifetime reproductive success (LRS). We show here that the traditional approximation of extinction probability in terms of the mean and variance of LRS does not always apply, because the LRS has a skewed, often multimodal, distribution. To exemplify distinct life history patters, we use the Hadza and Pacific Chinook salmon. The traditional approximation overestimates the exact extinction probability from complete LRS distribution. An accurate analysis of the distribution of LRS strengthens our ability to successfully analyze evolution. © 2022, Indian Institute of Science.","","Biology; Accurate analysis; Chinook salmon; Extinction probability; Large parts; Life history; Multimodal distributions; Reproductive success; Traditional approximation; Probability distributions","","","","","","","Charlesworth B., Williamson J.A., The probability of survival of a mutant gene in an age-structured population and implications for the evolution of life-histories, Genet Res, 26, 1, pp. 1-10, (1975); Crow J.F., Motoo K., Et al., Introduction to Population Genetics Theory, (1970); Mathematical population genetics 1: Theoretical introduction, vol 27, Springer Science & Business Media, (2012); Fisher R.A., The genetical theory of natural selection, (1930); Hartl D.L., Clark A.G., Principles of Population Genetics, (2007); Jones N., Blurton G., Et al., Demography of the Hadza, an increasing and high density population of savanna foragers, Am J Phys Anthropol, 89, 2, pp. 159-181, (1992); Kareiva P., Michelle M., McClure M., Recovery and management options for spring/summer chinook salmon in the Columbia River Basin, Science, 290, 5493, pp. 977-979, (2000); Mode C.J., Multitype branching processes: Theory and applications, (1971); Ratner S., Russell L., Roper B.B., Population viability analysis of Spring Chinook Salmon in the South Umpqua River, Oregon, Conserv Biol, 11, 4, pp. 879-889, (1997); Tuljapurkar S., Steiner U.K., Hecht O.S., Dynamic heterogeneity in life histories, Ecol Lett, 12, 1, pp. 93-106, (2009); Tuljapurkar S., Et al., Skewed distributions of lifetime reproductive success: beyond mean and variance, Ecol Lett, 23, 4, pp. 748-756, (2020); van Daalen S.F., Caswell H., Lifetime reproductive output: individual stochasticity, variance, and sensitivity analysis, Theor Ecol, 10, 3, pp. 355-374, (2017); Wolak M.E., Et al., Sex-specific additive genetic variances and correlations for fitness in a song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population subject to natural immigration and inbreeding, Evolution, 72, 10, pp. 2057-2075, (2018); Fertility rate, total (Births per woman), World Bank Open Data, (2021)","S.

Here, we extend life-table response experiments (LTREs) to variable environments, showing how to quantify contributions made by (1) mean vital rates, (2) variability driven by environmental fluctuations, (3) correlations implying demographic trade-offs and reflecting stage transition synchrony, and (4) elasticities reflecting local selection pressures. Applying our methods to the lady's slipper orchid Cypripediumcalceolus, we found that mean rates accounted for 77.1% of all effects on the stochastic growth rate, variability accounted for 12.6%, elasticities accounted for 6.6%, and correlations accounted for 3.7%. Stochastic effects accounted for 17.6%, 15.3%, and 35.9% of the total in our three populations. Larger elasticities to transitions between dormancy states and stronger correlations between emergence and survival suggest that one population was under greater pressure to remain active while the other two showed survival payoffs for dormancy in poor years. Strong negative correlations between dormancy, emergence, and stasis balanced opposing contributions, resulting in near stationarity in two populations. These new methods provide an additional tool for researchers investigating stochastic population dynamics and should be useful for a broad range of applications in basic ecology and conservation biology. © 2013 by The University of Chicago. 0003-0147/2013/18103-54025$15.00.

Researchers are often interested in identifying the processes responsible for such change. We derive an equation to exactly decompose change in the mean value of a phenotypic trait into contributions from fluctuations in the demographic structure and age-specific viability selection, fertility selection, phenotypic plasticity, and differences between offspring and parental trait values. We treat fitness as a sum of its components rather than as a scalar and explicitly consider age structure by focusing on short time steps, which are appropriate for describing phenotypic change in species with overlapping generations. We apply the method to examine stasis in birth weight in a well-characterized population of red deer. Stasis is achieved because positive viability selection for an increase in birth weight is countered by parents producing offspring that are, on average, smaller than they were at birth. This is one of many ways in which equilibria in the mean value of a phenotypic trait can be maintained. The age-structured Price equation we derive has the potential to provide considerable insight into the processes generating now frequently reported cases of rapid phenotypic change. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.","Birth weight; Price equation; Red deer; Selection differential","Age Distribution; Animals; Birth Weight; Deer; Ecosystem; Evolution; Female; Male; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Selection (Genetics); Time Factors; Cervus elaphus; age structure; deer; demography; environmental gradient; fitness; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; time series analysis; age distribution; animal; article; biological model; birth weight; deer; ecosystem; evolution; female; genetic selection; genetics; male; physiology; population dynamics; time","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG022500)","","Agnew P., Koella J.C., Life history interactions with environmental conditions in a host-parasite relationship and the parasite's mode of transmission, Evolutionary Ecology, 13, pp. 67-89, (1999); Arnold S., Wade M., On the measurement of natural and sexual selection: Theory, Evolution, 38, pp. 709-719, (1984); Benton T.G., Beckerman A.P., Population dynamics in a noisy world: Lessons from a mite experimental system, Advances in Ecological Research, 37, pp. 143-181, (2005); Both C., Artemyev A.V., Blaauw B., Cowie R.J., Dekhuijzen A.J., Eeva T., Enemar A., Et al., Large-scale geographical variation confirms that climate change causes birds to lay earlier, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271, pp. 1657-1662, (2004); Braks M.A.H., Honorio N.A., Lounibos L.P., Lourenco-De-Oliveira R., Juliano S.A., Interspecific competition between two invasive species of container mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae), in Brazil, Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 97, pp. 130-139, (2004); Bulmer M., The mathematical theory of quantitative genetics, (1980); Caswell H., Matrix population models: Construction, analysis and interpretation, (2001); Charlesworth B., Natural selection on multivariate traits in age-structured populations, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 251, pp. 47-52, (1993); Charlesworth B., Evolution in age-structured populations, (1994); Reproductive success: Studies of individual variation in contrasting breeding systems, (1988); Clutton-Brock T.H., Albon S.D., Winter mortality in red deer (Cervus elaphus), Journal of Zoology, 198, pp. 515-519, (1982); Clutton-Brock T.H., Coulson T., Ungulate population dynamics: The devil is in the detail, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 357, pp. 1299-1306, (2002); Clutton-Brock T.H., Guinness F.E., Albon S.D., Red deer: Behaviour and ecology of two sexes, (1982); Clutton-Brock T.H., Major M., Albon S.D., Guinness F.E., Early development and population dynamics in red deer. 1.

This is due in part to the wellknown variation in life expectancy between groups: large differences in race, sex, socioeconomic status, or other covariates. But within-group variance is large even in narrowly defined groups, and changes substantially and inversely with the group average length of life. We show that variance in length of life is inversely related to the Gompertz slope of log mortality through age, and we reveal its relationship to variance in a multiplicative frailty index. Our findings bear a variety of implications for modeling and forecasting mortality. In particular, we examine how the assumption of proportional hazards fails to account adequately for differences in subgroup variance, and we discuss how several common forecasting models treat the variance in the temporal dimension. © 2011 Shripad Tuljapurkar & Ryan D.

This chapter outlines the questions that are key to an evolutionary understanding of menopause, and the failure of some well-known theories of aging to deal with these questions. The chapter then introduces and explains the concept of ""borrowed fitness"" in which post-reproductive ages can indirectly acquire fitness from reproductive ages. Several mechanisms for this kind of ""borrowing"" are then discussed, including the grandmother effect, the contributions of older males, and most generally, an approach based on the transfers from and to different ages, both reproductive and post-reproductive. We also discuss other theoretical advances in the understanding of the evolution of old age mortality. We suggest that further development of the transfer approach is the most likely to lead to advances in our understanding of the evolution of menopause.

However, the potential impact of changing climatic variability on the fate of populations has been largely unexamined. We analyzed multiyear demographic data for 36 plant and animal species with a broad range of life histories and types of environment to ask how sensitive their long-term stochastic population growth rates are likely to be to changes in the means and standard deviations of vital rates (survival, reproduction, growth) in response to changing climate. We quantified responsiveness using elasticities of the long-term population growth rate predicted by stochastic projection matrix models. Short-lived species (insects and annual plants and algae) are predicted to be more strongly (and negatively) affected by increasing vital rate variability relative to longer-lived species (perennial plants, birds, ungulates). Taxonomic affiliation has little power to explain sensitivity to increasing variability once longevity has been taken into account.

Why? We analyze the robustness of LC using sensitivity analyses based on matrix perturbation theory, coupled with simulations that examine the effect of unavoidable randomness in mortality data. The combined effects of sensitivity and uncertainty determine the robustness of LC. We find that the sensitivity of LC and the uncertainty of death rates both have non-uniform patterns across ages and years. The sensitivities are small in general, with the largest sensitivities at both ends of the period. The uncertainties of death rates are high in young ages (5–19 years) and old ages (90+ years), rising in young ages but dropping in old ages. Our results reveal that LC is robust against random perturbation and sudden short-term changes. © 2024 International Institute of Forecasters","Age vector; Death rate; Matrix perturbation theory; Randomness; Robustness; Singular value decomposition; Time vector; Variance","","","","","","NIHR21AG061639-02","This work was funded by NIHR21AG061639-02, United States, for all authors, WZ, AD and ST.

Early analyses of GWASs are commonly believed to have ""missed"" much of the additive genetic variance estimated from correlations between relatives. A more recent method, genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), obtains much higher estimates of heritability using a model of random SNP effects correlated between genotypically similar individuals. GCTA has now been applied to many phenotypes from schizophrenia to scholastic achievement. However, recent studies question GCTA's estimates of heritability. Here, we show that GCTA applied to current SNP data cannot produce reliable or stable estimates of heritability. We show first that GCTA depends sensitively on all singular values of a high-dimensional genetic relatedness matrix (GRM). When the assumptions in GCTA are satisfied exactly, we show that the heritability estimates produced by GCTA will be biased and the standard errors will likely be inaccurate. When the population is stratified, we find that GRMs typically have highly skewed singular values, and we prove that the many small singular values cannot be estimated reliably. Hence, GWAS data are necessarily overfit by GCTA which, as a result, produces high estimates of heritability. We also show that GCTA's heritability estimates are sensitive to the chosen sample and to measurement errors in the phenotype. We illustrate our results using the Framingham dataset. Our analysis suggests that results obtained using GCTA, and the results' qualitative interpretations, should be interpreted with great caution.","GCTA; GWAS; Heritability; Singular value decomposition; SNP","Data Interpretation, Statistical; Datasets as Topic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Article; genetic association; genetic linkage; genetic variability; genome wide complex trait analysis; genotype; heritability; human; measurement error; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; genome-wide association study; information processing; procedures; quantitative trait; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical analysis; statistics and numerical data","","","","","Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies; Stanford Center for Computational; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (K01AG047280, P01AG022500)","We thank Chiara Sabatti, Chris Gignoux, David Golan, David Steinsaltz, Edgar Dobriban, Jonathan Pritchard, and Kenneth Wachter for useful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

In this quest, the possible effects of laboratory colonization of mosquitoes on infectivity and development of P. vivax is of interest given that colonized mosquitoes can be genetically less divergent than the field population from which they originated. Methods: Patient-derived P. vivax infected blood was fed to age-matched wild and colonized An. stephensi. Such a comparison requires coordinated availability of same-age wild and colonized mosquito populations. Here, P. vivax infection are studied in colonized An. stephensi in their 66th-86th generation and fresh field-caught An. stephensi. Wild mosquitoes were caught as larvae and pupae and allowed to develop into adult mosquitoes in the insectary. Parasite development to oocyst and sporozoite stages were assessed on days 7/8 and 12/13, respectively. Results: While there were batch to batch variations in infectivity of individual patient-derived P. vivax samples, both wild and colonized An. stephensi were roughly equally susceptible to oocyst stage Plasmodium infection. At the level of sporozoite development, significantly more mosquitoes with sporozoite load of 4+ were seen in wild than in colonized populations. © 2018 The Author(s).","","Animals; Anopheles; Female; India; Mosquito Vectors; Plasmodium vivax; Anopheles stephensi; Article; controlled study; female; imago; infection sensitivity; larva; microbial colonization; microscopy; nonhuman; oocyst; parasite development; Plasmodium vivax malaria; pupa; sporozoite; animal; Anopheles; India; isolation and purification; mosquito vector; parasitology; Plasmodium vivax","","","","","National Institute of Malaria Research; US NIAID, (U19 AI089688); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (U19AI089688); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID; University of Washington, UW; Indian Council of Medical Research, ICMR","This work was supported by the US NIAID MESA-ICEMR Program Project U19 AI089688 (Program Director, Pradipsinh K.

Stratification of global parasites has revealed spatial relatedness of parasite genotypes on different continents. Here, genomic analysis was further improved to obtain country-level resolution by removing var genes and intergenic regions from distance calculations. P. falciparum genomes from India were found to be most closely related to each other. Their nearest neighbors were from Bangladesh and Myanmar, followed by Thailand. Samples from the rest of Southeast Asia, Africa and South America were increasingly more distant, demonstrating a high-resolution genomic-geographic continuum. Such genome stratification approaches will help monitor variations of malaria parasites within South Asia and future changes in parasite populations that may arise from in-country and cross-border migrations. © 2016 The Author(s)","Epidemiology; Malaria; Molecular; Neighbors; Populations","Asia; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Protozoan; Genomics; Genotype; Humans; India; Malaria, Falciparum; Phylogeny; Plasmodium falciparum; spacer DNA; Africa; Article; Bangladesh; genome; genome analysis; geographic distribution; India; Myanmar; nonhuman; parasite migration; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; South America; South Asia; Southeast Asia; Thailand; Asia; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; genotype; human; Malaria, Falciparum; parasitology; phylogeny; Plasmodium falciparum; population genetics; procedures","","","","","International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research; US NIH; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (U19AI089688); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID","The authors thank all of the study participants and clinical research staff at the Goa Medical College and Hospital who assisted with this work.

This variation can be explained by factors related to individuals (fixed heterogeneity) and stochastic differences in survival and reproduction (dynamic heterogeneity). In this study, we study the relative effects of these processes on the LRS of a Dutch Kestrel population, using three different methods. First, we extended neutral simulations by simulating LRS distributions of populations consisting of groups with increasingly different population parameters. Decomposition of total LRS variance into contributions from fixed and dynamic heterogeneity revealed that the proportion of fixed heterogeneity is probably lower than 10% of the total variance. Secondly, we used sensitivities of the mean and variance in LRS to each parameter to analytically show that it is impossible to get equal contributions of fixed and dynamic heterogeneity when only one parameter differs between groups. Finally, we computed the LRS probability distribution to show that even when all individuals have identical survival and reproduction rates, the variance in LRS is large (females: 27.52, males: 12.99). Although each method has its limitations, they all lead to the conclusion that the majority of the variation in kestrel LRS is caused by dynamic heterogeneity. This large effect of dynamic heterogeneity on LRS is similar to results for other species and contributes to the evidence that in most species the majority of individual variation in LRS is due to dynamic heterogeneity. © 2020 The Authors.

But many users of period life expectancy do not understand and interpret life expectancy as demographers do. In particular, period life expectancy almost always over-predicts the crude death rate. Indeed, in most observed populations, the annual deaths recorded are always less than one may expect in the corresponding stationary population. To explain this over-prediction, in this paper we analyze how deviations from stationarity affect the crude death rate. We use theory to show that small deviations from the stationary age structure (as high as 20% at each age) always lead to over-prediction. Then we examine global data to show that over-prediction is widespread, occurring even in populations where the deviation from stationarity is large. Finally, we show that populations around the world and over many decades have age structures that are almost always far from stationary (or indeed, stability). But we also show that the deviation is often due to the demographic transition, with population bulges at the middle ages where mortality is low. © 2023, The Author(s).","Crude death rate; Life expectancy; Sensitivity","","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC","Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

Their results demonstrate how ecological and evolutionary studies can benefit from including explicit environmental drivers when modelling populations, and from the use of mean and variance elasticities. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","","Animals; Ecosystem; Evolution; Longevity; Macropodidae; Models, Biological; Population Growth; Macropus rufus; environmental change; environmental effect; evolutionary biology; growth rate; marsupial; population growth; population modeling; precipitation assessment; animal; article; biological model; ecosystem; evolution; genetics; longevity; marsupial; physiology; population growth","","","","","","","Boyce M., Haridas C., Lee C., Demography in an increasingly variable world, Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 21, pp. 141-148, (2006); Caswell H., Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis and Interpretation, (2001); Caswell H., Kaye T.N., Stochastic demography and conservation of an endangered perennial plant (Lomatium bradshawii) in a dynamic fire regime, Advances in Ecological Research, 32, pp. 1-51, (2001); Coulson T., Catchpole E.A., Albon S.D., Morgan B.J.T., Pemberton J.M., Clutton-Brock T.H., Crawley M.J., Grenfell B.T., Age, sex, density, winter weather, and population crashes in Soay sheep, Science, 292, pp. 1528-1531, (2001); Emanuel K., Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years, Nature, 436, pp. 686-688, (2005); Gervais J., Hunter C., Anthony R., Interactive effects of prey and p, p'-DDE on burrowing owl population dynamics, Ecological Applications, 16, pp. 666-677, (2006); Haridas C.V., Tuljapurkar S., Elasticities in variable environments: Properties and implications, The American Naturalist, 166, pp. 481-495, (2005); Hunter C.M., Caswell H., Runge M.C., Regehr E.V., Amstrup S.C., Stirling I., Polar Bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea II: Demography and Population Growth in Relation to Sea Ice Conditions, (2007); Jonzen N., Pople T., Knape K., Skjold M., Stochastic demography and population dynamics in the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus), Journal of Animal Ecology, 79, pp. 109-116, (2010); Kruuk L.E., Slate J., Wilson A.J., New answers for old questions: The evolutionary quantitative genetics of wild animal populations, Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 39, pp. 525-548, (2008); Lande R., Engen S., Saether B.-E., Stochastic Population Dynamics in Ecology and Conservation., (2003); Lebreton J., Burnham K., Clobert J., Anderson D., Modeling survival and testing biological hypotheses using marked animals - A unified approach with case-studies, Ecological Monographs, 62, pp. 67-118, (1992); Menges E., Quintana Ascencio P., Weekley C., Gaoue O., Population viability analysis and fire return intervals for an endemic Florida scrub mint, Biological Conservation, 127, pp. 115-127, (2006); Metcalf C.J.E., Pavard S., Why evolutionary biologists should be demographers, Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 22, pp. 205-212, (2007); Morris W., Doak D., Quantitative Conservation Biology, (2002); Morris W., Pfister C., Tuljapurkar S., Haridas C., Boggs C., Boyce M., Bruna E., Church D., Coulson T., Doak D., Forsyth S., Gaillard J.-M., Horvitz C., Kalisz S., Kendall B., Knight T., Lee C., Menges E., Longevity can buffer plant and animal populations against changing climatic variability, Ecology, 89, pp. 19-25, (2008); Nichols J., Kendall W., The use of multi-state capture-recapture models to address questions in evolutionary ecology, Journal of Applied Statistics, 22, pp. 835-846, (1995); Rydgren K., Okland R., Pico F., De Kroon H., Moss species benefits from breakdown of cyclic rodent dynamics in boreal forests, Ecology, 88, pp. 2320-2329, (2007); Smith M., Caswell H., Mettler-Cherry P., Stochastic flood and precipitation regimes and the population dynamics of a threatened floodplain plant, Ecological Applications, 15, pp. 1036-1052, (2005); Tenhumberg B., Tyre A., Pople A., Possingham H., Do harvest refuges buffer kangaroos against evolutionary responses to selective harvesting?, Ecology, 85, pp. 2003-2017, (2004); Thomson D., Matrix models as a tool for understanding invasive plant and native plant interactions, Conservation Biology, 19, (2005); Tuljapurkar S., Horvitz C.C., Pascarella J.B., The many growth rates and elasticities of populations in random environments, The American Naturalist, 162, pp. 489-502, (2003); Tuljapurkar S., Gaillard J., Coulson T., From stochastic environments to life histories and back, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Many field studies find that distributions of LRS among individuals are non-normal, zero-inflated and highly skewed. These results beg the question, what is the distribution of LRS predicted by demographic models when the only source of randomness is demographic stochasticity? Here we present the first exact analysis of the probability distribution of LRS for species described by age + stage models; our analysis starts with estimated vital rates. We illustrate with three examples: the Hadza, human hunter-foragers (age-only), the evergreen tree Tsuga canadensis (stage-only) and Roe deer, Capreolus capreolus (age + stage). For each we obtain the exact distribution of LRS, but also calculate and discuss the first three moments. Our results point to important questions about how such LRS distributions affect natural selection, and life history evolution. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","Age + stage; evolution; life history; lifetime reproductive success","Animals; Deer; Humans; Reproduction; Selection, Genetic; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Tsuga canadensis; age; demography; evergreen tree; evolutionary biology; hunting; life history; probability; reproductive success; stochasticity; animal; deer; genetic selection; human; reproduction","","","","","Hal Caswell","We thank Ni Lao, Hal Caswell, Maarten Broekmann for useful comments, and the referees and editors for suggesting many valuable changes.","Andersson M.B., Sexual Selection, (1994); Atkinson A.B., On the measurement of inequality, J.

The model is driven by the non-linear and interdependent relationships between the age distribution of a population, its behavior and technology, and the nature of its environment. The common currency in the model is the production of food, on which age-specific rates of birth and death depend. There is a single non-trivial equilibrium population at which productivity balances caloric needs. One of the most powerful controls on equilibrium hunger level is fertility control. Gains against hunger are accompanied by decreases in population size. Increasing worker productivity does increase equilibrium population size but does not improve welfare at equilibrium. As a case study we apply the model to the population of a Polynesian valley before European contact. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

These demographic events are influenced by genetic and environmental parameters, and are the focus of many evolutionary and ecological investigations that aim to predict and understand population change. However, such a focus often neglects the stochastic events that individuals experience throughout their lives. These stochastic events also influence survival and reproduction and thereby evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here, we illustrate the influence of such non-selective demographic variability on population dynamics using population projection models of an experimental population of Plantago lanceolata. Our analysis shows that the variability in survival and reproduction among individuals is largely due to demographic stochastic variation with only modest effects of differences in environment, genes, and their interaction. Common expectations of population growth, based on expected lifetime reproduction and generation time, can be misleading when demographic stochastic variation is large. Large demographic stochastic variation exhibited within genotypes can lower population growth and slow evolutionary adaptive dynamics. Our results accompany recent investigations that call for more focus on stochastic variation in fitness components, such as survival, reproduction, and functional traits, rather than dismissal of this variation as uninformative noise. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Biological Evolution; Crosses, Genetic; Ecology; Ecosystem; Environment; Genes, Plant; Genotype; Models, Theoretical; Plantago; Poisson Distribution; Population Dynamics; Reproducibility of Results; Reproduction; Stochastic Processes; ecology; ecosystem; environment; evolution; genetic cross; genetics; genotype; Markov chain; physiology; plant gene; Plantago; Poisson distribution; population dynamics; reproducibility; reproduction; theoretical model","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG008761, P01‐AG0225000‐01); National Institute on Aging, NIA; Marie Curie, (PIEF-GA-2009-235205); Marie Curie; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (430170797); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Freie Universität Berlin, FU","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 430170797, Marie-Curie PIEF-GA-2009-235205, National Institute on Aging, P01‐AG0225000‐01, P01-AG8761, Open Access Funding provided by the Freie Universität Berlin.","Metcalf C.J.E., Pavard S., Why evolutionary biologists should be demographers, Trends Ecol.

Here, we exploit age-from-stage methods for organisms with stage-structured demography to study cohort dynamics, obtaining age patterns of mortality by weighting one-period stage-specific survivals by expected age-specific stage structure. Cohort dynamics behave as a killed Markov process. Using as examples two African grasses, one pine tree, a temperate forest perennial herb, and a subtropical shrub in a hurricane-driven forest, we illustrate diverse patterns that may emerge. Age-specific mortality always reaches a plateau at advanced ages, but the plateau may be reached rapidly or slowly, and the trajectory may follow positive or negative senescence along the way. In variable environments, birth state influences mortality at early but not late ages, although its effect on the level of survivorship persists. A new parameter μω summarizes the risk of mortality averaged over the entire lifetime in a variable environment. Recent aging models for humans that employ nonobservable abstract states of ""vitality"" are also known to produce diverse trajectories and similar asymptotic behavior. We discuss connections, contrasts, and implications of our results to these models for the study of aging. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Copial phase duration declines with increases in the size of the founding group, maximum life expectancy and fertility; it increases with habitat area and yield per hectare; and, it is unaffected by the sensitivity of vital rates to hunger. Transition phase duration is unaffected by size of founding population and area of settlement; it declines with yield, life expectancy, fertility and the sensitivity of vital rates to hunger. We characterize the transition phase as the Malthusian transition interval (MTI), in order to highlight how little time populations generally have to adjust. Under food-limited density dependence, the copial phase passes quickly to an equilibrium of grim Malthusian constraints, in the manner of a runner dashing over an invisible cliff. The three-phase pattern diverges from widely held intuitions based on standard Lotka-Verhulst approaches to population regulation, with implications for the analysis of socio-cultural evolution, agricultural intensification, bioarchaeological interpretation of food stress in prehistoric societies, and state-level collapse. © 2014 Puleston et al.","","Female;

In this paper, we examine life-history evolution in a variable environment, by decomposing average individual fitness (measured by the long-run stochastic growth rate) into contributions from average vital rates and their temporal variation. We examine how generation time, demographic dispersion (measured by the dispersion of reproductive events across the lifespan), demographic resilience (measured by damping time), within-year variances in vital rates, within-year correlations between vital rates and between-year correlations in vital rates combine to determine average individual fitness of stylized life histories. In a fluctuating environment, we show that there is often a range of cohort generation times at which the fitness is at a maximum. Thus, we expect 'optimal' phenotypes in fluctuating environments to differ from optimal phenotypes in constant environments. We show that stochastic growth rates are strongly affected by demographic dispersion, even when deterministic growth rates are not, and that demographic dispersion also determines the response of life-history-specific average fitness to within- and between-year correlations. Serial correlations can have a strong effect on fitness, and, depending on the structure of the life history, may act to increase or decrease fitness. The approach we outline takes a useful first step in developing general life-history theory for non-constant environments. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Demographic dispersion; Generation time; Life history; Reproduction; Stochastic growth rate; Survival","cohort analysis; decomposition; demography; evolution; fitness; growth rate; life history; reproduction; stochasticity","","","","","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/E015921/1, cpb010001)","","Athreya K.B., Karlin S., Branching processes with random environments.

To study such variation we propose the use of dynamic models of observable phenotypes of individuals. Phenotypic change in turn determines variation among individuals in their fitness components over the life course. We refer to this dynamic accumulation of fitness differences as dynamic heterogeneity and illustrate it for an animal population in which longitudinal data are studied using multistate capture-mark-recapture models. Although our approach can be applied to any characteristic, for our empirical example we use reproduction as the phenotypic character to define stages. We indicate how our stage-structured model describes the nature of the variation among individual characteristics that is generated by dynamic heterogeneity. We conclude by discussing our ongoing and planned work on animals and humans. We also discuss the connections between our work and recent work on human mortality, disability and health, and life course theory. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.","fitness; individual heterogeneity; life course; life history; phenotypic variation","","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG022500)","","Stearns S.C., Life-history tactics: A review of the ideas, Q.

In practice, however, these effects might be strongly correlated, for example as a result of tradeoffs between vital rates. To get better insights into the effects of herbivory on the population dynamics of the long-lived grassland plant Primula veris population projection matrices were constructed from demographic data collected between 1999 and 2008 (nine annual transitions). Data were collected in two large grassland populations, each of which was subjected to two treatments (grazing by cattle versus a mowing treatment), yielding a total of 36 matrices. We applied a lower-level vital rate life table response experiment (LTRE) using the small noise approximation (SNA) of the stochastic population growth rate to disentangle the contributions of changes in mean vital rates, variability in vital rates, correlations between vital rates and vital rate elasticities to the difference in the stochastic growth rate. Stochastic growth rates (a= log λ S) were significantly lower in grazed than in mown plots (a= 0.0185 and 0.1019, respectively). SNA LTRE analysis showed that contributions of mean vital rates by far made the largest contribution to the observed difference in a between grazed and control plots. In particular, changes in sexual reproduction rates made the largest contributions to lower the stochastic growth rate in grazed plots: both adult flowering probabilities and flower and seed production were importantly lower in grazed populations, but these negative effects were largely buffered by increased establishment and seedling survival rates. Among the stochastic terms of the SNA decomposition, contributions of covariance and correlations between vital rates had the largest impact, whereas contributions of elasticities were smaller. The strongest correlation driver was the association between adult survival and seedling establishment, suggesting that environmental conditions favouring adult survival also are beneficial for seedling establishment. Overall, our results show that herbivory had a strong negative effect on the long-term population growth rate of P. veris that was primarily mediated by differences in fecundity (flower and seed production) and germination. © 2011 The Authors.

However, we know relatively little about how species respond to such climate fluctuations, with respect to variation in vital rates (i.e. survival, growth and reproduction of individuals) and population fluctuations. We examine whether populations display evidence of buffering against environmental variation in one of two ways: (1) through negative covariances among vital rates, or (2) reduction of variation in those vital rates to which population growth is most sensitive. We analyse time series of demographic data for 40 plant species and show that there is no evidence for either of these mechanisms. In species in which there is evidence for vital rate covariation, positive covariances between reproduction and survival rates predominate, and tend to magnify the effect of variability. Increasing climate variability is therefore expected to increase population fluctuations and extinction risks. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Buffering; Climate change; Life history; Life span; Population dynamics; Trade-offs; Variance decomposition","Climate Change; Extinction, Biological; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Plants; Population Dynamics; biological model; climate change; plant; population dynamics; species extinction; statistical model","","","","","","","Al-Khafaji K., Tuljapurkar S., Horvitz C., Koop A., Detecting variability in demographic rates: randomization with the Kullback-Leibler distance, J.

However, most studies focusing on life-history trade-offs focus on two traits and assume trade-offs to be static. Our work provides a framework for understanding covariation among multiple traits and how population density influences the traits. Using detailed individual-based data for Soay sheep, we find density strongly shapes life-history trade-offs and distribution of lifetime reproductive success (LRS). At low density, a trade-off between juvenile survival and growth structures life-history variation, whereas at equilibrium density, trade-off between reproduction and juvenile survival is the major structuring axes. Contrary to Lomnicki's prediction, we find that at high density, there is little variation in the LRS over the sizes (large juveniles and adults) that contribute to reproduction. Our results advance an understanding of dynamic nature of trade-offs offer insights into how high-density limits diversity of individual life histories and have implications for evolution via density-dependent selection. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","density dependence; density-dependent selection; life history; LRS; trade-offs; trait covariation","Animals; Female; Life History Traits; Male; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Sheep; density dependence; growth rate; life history theory; population density; reproductive success; sheep; survival; trade-off; animal; female; life history trait; male; physiology; population density; population dynamics; reproduction; sheep","","","","","Stanford University, SU; Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, ANR, (ANR‐22‐CE02‐0020); Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, ANR","H.J. would like to thank Bing\u2010Ehrlich Fellowship and Stanford University for their funding.

Harvest or recurrent biomass removal can act as a selective force. However, our understanding of how harvest and changes in climate can synergistically shape plant evolutionary strategies is limited. We used age-from-stage matrix modeling to investigate how chronic anthropogenic disturbance (severe foliage and bark harvest) affects age-specific mortality trajectories of a tropical tree, Khaya senegalensis in two contrasting climatic regions (dry versus moist) in West Africa. We then developed a stochastic model to test if changes in disturbance regime and the environmental conditions in which a cohort is born may alter stochastic age-specific mortality rates. The effect of harvest on age-specific mortality trajectories was modest and only noticeable in the moist region. Age-specific mortality trajectories differed significantly between regions. In the moist region, mortality rates decreased with age for the first 30 years of life to a minimum rate and then increased gradually after to reach an old age mortality plateau. In the dry region, mortality rates decreased with age to reach a plateau asymptotically. This difference in age-specific mortality trajectory is due to a greater delay in reaching reproductive size/age in the dry region. Our findings underscore intraspecific variation in age-specific mortality schedules and indicate that climatic effect may override the impact of anthropogenic activities on plant demography. Harvest, by favoring fast life stage transition to reproductive stages, can buffer the effect of drought. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Age-from-stage; Age-specific mortality; Climate change; Matrix models; Non-timber forest products harvest","West Africa; Khaya senegalensis; Climate change; Climate models; Drought; Evolutionary algorithms; Forestry; Harvesting; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Trajectories; Tropics; Age-specific mortality; Anthropogenic disturbance; Anthropogenic stressors; Environmental conditions; Intraspecific variation; Matrix model; Non-timber forest products; Sustainable resource management; anthropogenic effect; biomass; climate change; demography; disturbance; drought; ecological modeling; environmental conditions; human activity; intraspecific variation; mortality; nontimber forest product; resource management; strategic approach; tree; tropical region; Population statistics","","","","","NIH-NIA, (P01 AG022500-01); University of Tennessee Knoxville; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DEB-0614457); National Science Foundation, NSF; International Foundation for Science, IFS, (D/3694); International Foundation for Science, IFS; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG","This work was supported by a start-up grant from the University of Tennessee Knoxville, and the International Foundation for Science Grant D/3694 to OGG, UKS was supported by the Max Planck Society, the National Science Foundation DEB-0614457 to CCH and NIH-NIA P01 AG022500-01 to ST and CCH.","Allen C.D., Macalady A.K., Chenchouni H., Bachelet D., McDowell N., Vennetier M., Kitzberger T., Rigling A., Breshears D.D., Hogg E.T., Et al., A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests, For.

In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for child mortality were met only by a few countries. Valid concerns exist as to whether the region would meet new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for under-5 mortality. We therefore examine further sources of variation by assessing age patterns, trends, and forecasts of mortality rates. Methods and findings Data came from 106 nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) with full birth histories from 31 SSA countries from 1990 to 2017 (a total of 524 countryyears of data). We assessed the distribution of age at death through the following new demographic analyses. First, we used a direct method and full birth histories to estimate under-5 mortality rates (U5MRs) on a monthly basis. Second, we smoothed raw estimates of death rates by age and time by using a two-dimensional P-Spline approach. Third, a variant of the Lee–Carter (LC) model, designed for populations with limited data, was used to fit and forecast age profiles of mortality. We used mortality estimates from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) to adjust, validate, and minimize the risk of bias in survival, truncation, and recall in mortality estimation. Our mortality model revealed substantive declines of death rates at every age in most countries but with notable differences in the age patterns over time. U5MRs declined from 3.3% (annual rate of reduction [ARR] 0.1%) in Lesotho to 76.4% (ARR 5.2%) in Malawi, and the pace of decline was faster on average (ARR 3.2%) than that observed for infant (IMRs) (ARR 2.7%) and neonatal (NMRs) (ARR 2.0%) mortality rates. We predict that 5 countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda) are on track to achieve the under-5 sustainable development target by 2030 (25 deaths per 1,000 live births), but only Rwanda and Tanzania would meet both the neonatal (12 deaths per 1,000 live births) and under-5 targets simultaneously. Our predicted NMRs and U5MRs were in line with those estimated by the UN IGME by 2030 and 2050 (they overlapped in 27/31 countries for NMRs and 22 for U5MRs) and by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) by 2030 (26/31 and 23/31, respectively). This study has a number of limitations, including poor data quality issues that reflected bias in the report of births and deaths, preventing reliable estimates and predictions from a few countries. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine full birth histories and mortality estimates from external reliable sources to model age patterns of under-5 mortality across time in SSA. We demonstrate that countries with a rapid pace of mortality reduction (ARR � 3.2%) across ages would be more likely to achieve the SDG mortality targets. However, the lower pace of neonatal mortality reduction would prevent most countries from achieving those targets: 2 countries would reach them by 2030, 13 between 2030 and 2050, and 13 after 2050. © 2019 Mejía-Guevara et al.","","Africa South of the Sahara; Age Distribution; Child Mortality; Child, Preschool; Female; Forecasting; Health Surveys; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Kenya; Lesotho; Malawi; Male; Models, Theoretical; Rwanda; Senegal; Tanzania; Uganda; age distribution; article; childhood mortality; clinical article; controlled study; data quality; demography; female; health survey; human; infant; Kenya; Lesotho; live birth; Malawi; male; mortality rate; newborn; newborn mortality; prediction; recall; risk assessment; Rwanda; Senegal; sustainable development; Tanzania; Uganda; United Nations; Africa south of the Sahara; age distribution; childhood mortality; epidemiology; forecasting; infant mortality; preschool child; procedures; theoretical model","","","","","National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (UL1TR001085); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS","","Hill K., You D., Inoue M., Oestergaard M.Z., Technical Advisory Group of the United Nations Inter-agencyGroup for Child Mortality Estimation, Child Mortality Estimation: Accelerated Progress in Reducing Global Child Mortality, 1990–2010, 9, 8, (2012); Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2015); Alkema L., New J.R., Global estimation of child mortality using a Bayesian B-spline Bias-reduction model, Annappl Stat, 8, 4, pp. 2122-2149, (2014); Levels & Trends in Child Mortality: Report 2018, (2018); World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, (2017); Deribew A., Tessema G.A., Deribe K., Melaku Y.A., Lakew Y., Amare A.T., Et al., Trends, Causes, and Risk Factorsof Mortality among Children under 5 in Ethiopia, 1990–2013: Findings from the Global Burden of Diseasestudy 2013, (2016); Ruducha J., Mann C., Singh N.S., Gemebo T.D., Tessema N.S., Baschieri A., Et al., How Ethiopia achieved Millennium Development Goal 4 through multisectoral interventions: A Countdown to 2015 case study, Lancet Glob Health, 5, 11, pp. e1142-e1151, (2017); Sawyer C.C., Child Mortality Estimation: Estimating Sex Differences in Childhood Mortality since the1970s.

But this classical result is limited to age-structured populations. Here we generalize this result to populations structured by stage and age by providing a new, unique measure of reproductive timing (Tc) that, along with net reproductive rate (R0), has a direct mathematical relationship to and approximates growth rate (r). We use simple examples to show how reproductive timing Tc and level R0 are shaped by stage dynamics (individual trait changes), selection on the trait, and parent-offspring phenotypic correlation.We also show how population structure can affect dispersion in reproduction among ages and stages. These macroscopic features of the life history determine population growth rate r and reveal a complex interplay of trait dynamics, timing, and level of reproduction. Our results contribute to a new framework of population and evolutionary dynamics in stage-and-age-structured populations. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.","Age-stage structure; Biodemography; Life-history evolution;

Populations are constituted by individuals with different phenotypes and thus different performances. However, many models of population dynamics provide no understanding of the influence of this phenotypic variation on population dynamics. In this paper, we investigate how the relationships between demographic rates and phenotype distribution influence the transmission and the upholding of phenotypic variation, and population dynamics. We used integral projection models to measure associations between differences of phenotypic trait (size or mass) among individuals and demographic rates, growth and inheritance, and then quantify the influence of phenotypic variation on population dynamics. We build an analytical and general model resulting from simplifications assuming small phenotypic variance. We illustrate our model with two case studies: a short- and a long-lived life history. Population growth rate r is determined by a Lotka style equation in which survival and fertility are averaged over a phenotypic distribution that changes with age. Here, we further decomposed r to show how much it is affected by shifts in phenotypic average as well as variance. We derived the elasticities of r to the first and second derivative of each demographic rate. In particular, we show that the nonlinearity of change in selective pressure with phenotype matters more to population dynamics than the strength of this selection. In other words, the variance of a given trait will be most important when the strength of selection increases (or decreases) nonlinearly with that trait. Inheritance shapes the distribution of newborn phenotypes. Even if newborns have a fixed average phenotype, the variance among newborns increases with phenotypic variance among mothers, strength of inheritance and developmental variation. We explain how the components of inheritance can influence phenotypic variance and thus the demographic rates and population dynamics. In particular, when mothers of different ages produce offspring of different mean phenotype, the inheritance function can have a large influence on both the mean and variance of the trait at different ages and thus on the population growth rate. We provide new tools to understand how phenotypic variation influences population dynamics and discuss in which life histories we expect this influence to be large. For instance, in our short-lived life history, individual variability has larger effect than in our long-lived life history. We conclude by indicating future directions of analysis. © 2016 British Ecological Society.","Growth rate; Heritability; Individual heterogeneity; Inheritance; Integral projection model; Phenotypic variation;

Climate models predict increases in the frequency of intense hurricanes, but no study has measured their impact on individual life courses within animal populations. We used 45 years of demographic data of rhesus macaques to quantify the influence of major hurricanes on reproductive life courses using multiple metrics of dynamic heterogeneity accounting for life course variability and life-history trait variances. To reduce intraspecific competition, individuals may explore new reproductive stages during years of major hurricanes, resulting in higher temporal variation in reproductive trajectories. Alternatively, individuals may opt for a single optimal life-history strategy due to trade-offs between survival and reproduction. Our results show that heterogeneity in reproductive life courses increased by 4% during years of major hurricanes, despite a 2% reduction in the asymptotic growth rate due to an average decrease in mean fertility and survival by that is, shortened life courses and reduced reproductive output. In agreement with this, the population is expected to achieve stable population dynamics faster after being perturbed by a hurricane ((Figure presented.); 95% CI: 1.488, 1.538), relative to ordinary years (Figure presented.). Our work suggests that natural disasters force individuals into new demographic roles to potentially reduce competition during unfavourable environments where mean reproduction and survival are compromised. Variance in lifetime reproductive success and longevity are differently affected by hurricanes, and such variability is mostly driven by survival. © 2023 The Authors.

Even so, biologists commonly argue that large differences in fitness components are likely adaptive, resulting from and driving evolution by natural selection. To examine this argument we use unique formulas to compute exactly the variance in life span and in lifetime reproductive success among individuals with identical (genotypic) vital rates (assuming a common genotype for all individuals). Such individuals have identical fitness but vary substantially in their realized individual fitness components. We show by example that our computed variances and corresponding simulated distribution of fitness components match those observed in real populations. Of course, (genotypic) vital rates in real populations are expected to differ by small but evolutionarily important amounts among genotypes, but we show that such differences only modestly increase variances in fitness components. We conclude that observed differences in fitness components may likely be evolutionarily neutral, at least to the extent that they are indistinguishable from distributions generated by neutral processes. Important consequences of large neutral variation are the following: Heritabilities for fitness components are likely to be small (which is in fact the case), small selective differences in life historieswill be hard to measure, and the effects of random drift will be amplified in natural populations by the large variances among individuals.","Age-stage structure;

From a literature survey, we studied patterns of transient dynamics for mammalian species spanning a large range of life-history tactics and population growth rates. For each population, we built an age-structured matrix and calculated six metrics of transient dynamics. After controlling for possible confounding effects of the phylogenetic relatedness among species using a phylogenetic principal component analysis and phylogenetic generalized least squares models, we found that short-term demographic responses of mammalian populations to disturbance are shaped by generation time and growth rate. Species with a slow pace of life (i.e., species with a late maturity, a low fecundity, and a long life span) displayed decreases in population size after a disturbance, whereas fast-living species increased in population size. The magnitude of short-term variation in population size increased with asymptotic population growth, being buffered in slow-growing species (i.e., species with a low population growth rate) but large in fast-growing species. By demonstrating direct links between transient dynamics, life history (generation time), and ecology (demographic regime), our comparative analysis of transient dynamics clearly improves our understanding of population dynamics in variable environments and has clear implications for future studies of the interplay between evolutionary and ecological dynamics. As most populations in the wild are not at equilibrium, we recommend that analyses of transient dynamics be performed when studying population dynamics in variable environments. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

However, the links underlying these joint responses remain largely unknown owing to a paucity of long-term data and the lack of an appropriate analytical framework. Here we investigate the link between phenotypic and demographic responses to environmental change using a new methodology and a long-term (1976-2008) data set from a hibernating mammal (the yellow-bellied marmot) inhabiting a dynamic subalpine habitat. We demonstrate how earlier emergence from hibernation and earlier weaning of young has led to a longer growing season and larger body masses before hibernation. The resulting shift in both the phenotype and the relationship between phenotype and fitness components led to a decline in adult mortality, which in turn triggered an abrupt increase in population size in recent years. Direct and trait-mediated effects of environmental change made comparable contributions to the observed marked increase in population growth. Our results help explain how a shift in phenology can cause simultaneous phenotypic and demographic changes, and highlight the need for a theory integrating ecological and evolutionary dynamics in stochastic environments. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We analyzed the statics and dynamics of reproduction and survival in a wild population of the northern fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis (Procellaridae). Survival rate is most influenced by year as compared to age and cohort. When temporal variation is ignored, survival rate increases slowly with age and then declines more rapidly at late ages. Survival rate contingent upon reproductive 'stratum' (producing an egg, hatching an egg, fledging a hatchling) also exhibits this pattern. Survival and reproduction have a positive static association in that survival rate increases as the apparent energy allocated to reproduction increases (as indexed by stratum). There is a broad distribution of realized lifetime reproductive success, which could be due to 'fixed' heterogeneity, with some individuals always having low survival and reproduction and others always having high survival and reproduction, or be due to 'dynamic' heterogeneity, with all individuals having the same expected reproductive and survival rates. Analysis of stochastic stratum dynamics indicates that individuals do not remain long in any given stratum and suggest that the variation among individuals with respect to lifetime reproductive success is due to dynamic heterogeneity. The probability of producing an egg increases with age for both sexes, whereas the probability of producing a fledgling initially declines with age and then increases. These results underscore the necessity of understanding the static and dynamic expression of demographic traits when making a causal claim about their evolution. © 2011 The Authors.

Since generation time ((Formula presented.)) is known to capture aspects of life-history variation, such as life-history speed, does (Formula presented.) also determine reproductive dispersion ((Formula presented.)) or damping time ((Formula presented.))? Using phylogenetically corrected analyses on 633 species of animals and plants, we find, firstly, that reproductive dispersion (Formula presented.) scales isometrically with (Formula presented.). Secondly, and unexpectedly, we find that the damping time ((Formula presented.)) does not scale isometrically with generation time, but instead changes only as (Formula presented.) with (Formula presented.) (also, there is a similar scaling with (Formula presented.)). This non-isometric scaling implies a novel demographic contrast: increasing generation times correspond to a proportional increase in reproductive dispersion, but only to a slower increase in the damping time. Thus, damping times are partly decoupled from the slow-fast continuum, and are determined by factors other than allometric constraints. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biological time; damping time; generation time; life history; reproductive dispersion","Animals; Life History Traits; Plants; Reproduction; animal; life history trait; plant; reproduction","","","","","","","Brown J.H., Gillooly J.F., Allen A.P., Savage V.M., West G.B., Toward a metabolic theory of ecology, Ecology, 85, 7, pp. 1771-1789, (2004); Capdevila P., Stott I., Beger M., Salguero-Gomez R., Towards a comparative framework of demographic resilience, Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 35, 9, pp. 776-786, (2020); Carey J.R., Practical application of the stable age distribution: Analysis of a Tetranychid Mite (Acari: Tetranychidae) Population Outbreak, Environmental Entomology, 12, 1, pp. 10-18, (1983); Caswell H., Matrix population models: construction, analysis and interpretation, (2001); Charnov E.L., Life history invariants: some explorations of symmetry in evolutionary ecology, 6, (1993); Chesson P., Mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, 1, pp. 343-366, (2000); Coale A.J., The growth and structure of human populations: a mathematical investigation, (1972); Cochran M.E., Ellner S., Simple methods for calculating age-based life history parameters for stage-structured populations: ecological archives M062-002, Ecological Monographs, 62, 3, pp. 345-364, (1992); Cole L.C., The population consequences of life history phenomena, The Quarterly Review of Biology, 29, 2, pp. 103-137, (1954); Crespi B.J., Teo R., Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of semelparity and life history in salmonid fishes, Evolution, 56, 5, pp. 1008-1020, (2002); De Valpine P., Scranton K., Knape J., Ram K., Mills N.J., The importance of individual developmental variation in stage-structured population models, Ecology Letters, 17, 8, pp. 1026-1038, (2014); Dey C.J., Semeniuk C.A.D., Iverson S.A., Richardson E., McGeachy D., Gilchrist H.G., Forecasting the outcome of multiple effects of climate change on northern common eiders, Biological Conservation, 220, pp. 94-103, (2018); Ellner S.P., Snyder R.E., Adler P.B., Hooker G., An expanded modern coexistence theory for empirical applications, Ecology Letters, 22, 1, pp. 3-18, (2019); Franco M., Silvertown J., Life history variation in plants: an exploration of the fast-slow continuum hypothesis, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Predictions from population models that include measured individual characteristics often differ from models that exclude them. Similarly, unmeasured individual differences have the potential to impact predictions from population models. However, unmeasured individual differences are rarely included in population models. We construct stage- and age-structured models (where stage is mass) of a roe deer population, which are parameterized from statistical functions that either include, or ignore, unmeasured individual differences. We found that mass and age structures substantially impacted model parameters describing population dynamics, as did temporal environmental variation, while unmeasured individual differences impacted parameters describing population dynamics to a much smaller extent once individual heterogeneity related to mass and age has been included in the model. We discuss how our assumptions (unmeasured individual differences only in mean trait values) could have influenced our findings and under what circumstances unmeasured individual differences could have had a larger impact on population dynamics. There are two reasons explaining the relative small influence of unmeasured individual differences on population dynamics in roe deer. First, individual body mass and age both capture a large amount of individual differences in roe deer. Second, in large populations of long-lived animals, the average quality of individuals (independent of age and mass) within the population is unlikely to show substantial variation over time, unless rapid evolution is occurring. So even though a population consisting of high-quality individuals would have much higher population growth rate than a population consisting of low-quality individuals, the probability of observing a population consisting only of high-quality individuals is small. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Age structure; Body mass; Growth rate; Individual random effect; Integral projection model; Roe deer; Size structure","Aging; Animals; Body Weight; Deer; Demography; Female; France; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Animalia; Capreolus; age structure; body mass; deer; demographic trend; growth rate; individual-based model; quantitative analysis; size structure; aging; animal; biological model; body weight; deer; demography; female; France; physiology; population dynamics","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R24AG039345)","","Albon S.D., Coulson T.N., Brown D., Guinness F.E., Pemberton J.M., Clutton-Brock T.H., Temporal changes in key factors and key age groups influencing the population dynamics of female red deer, Journal of Animal Ecology, 69, pp. 1099-1110, (2000); Aubry L.M., Koons D.N., Monnat J.Y., Cam E., Consequences of recruitment decisions and heterogeneity on age-specific breeding success in a long lived seabird, Ecology, 90, pp. 2491-2502, (2009); Benton T.G., Plaistow S.J., Coulson T.N., Complex population dynamics and complex causation: devils, details and demography, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 1173-1181, (2006); Cam E., Link W.A., Cooch E.G., Monnat J.Y., Danchin E., Individual covariation in life-history traits: seeing the trees despite the forest, The American Naturalist, 159, pp. 96-105, (2002); Caswell H., A general formula for sensitivity of population growth rate to changes in life history parameters, Theoretical Population Biology, 14, pp. 215-230, (1978); Caswell H., Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis, and Interpretation, (2001); Caswell H., Beyond R-0: demographic models for variability of lifetime reproductive output, PLoS ONE, 6, (2011); Clark J., Uncertainty and variability in demography and population growth: A hierarchical approach, Ecology, 84, pp. 1370-1381, (2003); Coulson T., Integral projections models, their construction and use in posing hypotheses in ecology, Oikos, 121, pp. 1337-1350, (2012); Coulson T., Catchpole E.A., Albon S.D., Morgan B.J.T., Pemberton J.M., Clutton-Brock T.H., Crawley M.J., Grenfell B.T., Age, sex, density, winter weather, and population crashes in Soay sheep, Science, 292, pp. 1528-1531, (2001); Coulson T.N., Tuljapurkar S., Childs D.Z., Using evolutionary demography to link life history theory, quantitative genetics and population ecology, Journal of Animal Ecology, 79, pp. 1226-1240, (2010); Coulson T., Macnulty D.R., Stahler D.R., VonHoldt B., Wayne R.K., Smith D.W., Modeling effects of environmental change on wolf population dynamics, trait evolution, and life history, Science, 334, pp. 1275-1278, (2011); Delorme D., Gaillard J.M., Jullien J.M., Intérêt de l'étude de la période juvénile pour le suivi de l'évolution d'une population de chevreuils (Capreolus capreolus), Gibier Faune Sauvage, 5, pp. 15-26, (1988); Easterling M.R., Ellner S.P., Dixon P.M., Size-specific sensitivity: applying a new structured population model, Ecology, 81, pp. 694-708, (2000); Eberhardt L.L., Assessing the dynamics of wild populations, Journal of Widlife Management, 49, pp. 997-1012, (1985); Ellner S.P., Rees M., Integral projection models for species with complex demography, The American Naturalist, 167, pp. 410-428, (2006); Festa-Bianchet M., Gaillard J.M., Cote S.D., Variable age structure and apparent density dependence in survival of adult ungulates, Journal of Animal Ecology, 72, pp. 640-649, (2003); Flerov K.K., Fauna of USSR: Mammals Vol. 1 No. 2.

The Hawai'i Biocomplexity Project has used the Hawaiian archipelago and more specifically the Leeward Kohala Field System (LKFS) as a model system to investigate the dynamic, often non-linear interactions among soils, agricultural systems, populations, and sociopolitical systems over time scales of several centuries. Two major models have been developed: (1) a model of spatial and temporal variability in agricultural production; and (2) a model of food availability and its linkages to population fertility and mortality. Empirically derived field data were used both to parameterize the models, and to test their predictions. Archaeological data on the distribution and variation in ancient agricultural field infrastructure, derived from high-resolution LiDAR images, were used to test predictions of agricultural production and intensity. Similarly, chronological data on numbers of ancient households derived from archaeological excavation and radiocarbon dating were used to test model predictions of population growth over time. This iterative process of building and testing models has led to improved understanding of how pre-industrial agricultural systems were intensified, and how expansion and intensification were dynamically linked to demographic changes in farming populations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","CENTURY; Food ratio; Paleodemography; Polynesian archaeology; Sustainability","Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kohala; United States; Agriculture; Excavation; Forecasting; Geologic models; Optical radar; Population dynamics; Sustainable development; Agricultural fields; Agricultural intensification; Agricultural productions; Agricultural system; Archaeological excavations; Biocomplexity; CENTURY; Demographic changes; Field data; Food availability; Food ratio; High-resolution lidar; Iterative process; Malthusian; Model system; Nonlinear interactions; Paleodemography; Polynesian archaeology; Population change; Population growth; Pre-industrial; Radiocarbon dating; Spatial and temporal variability; Test models; Testing models; Time-scales; agricultural intensification; agricultural production; archaeological evidence; archaeology; data set; ecological impact; farming system; fertility; food availability; hypothesis testing; lidar; model test; nature-society relations; numerical model; parameterization; population dynamics; radiocarbon dating; sustainability; Population statistics","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (BCS-0119819, BCS-0624238); National Science Foundation, NSF","The research described in this paper was supported by National Science Foundation Grants BCS-0119819 and BCS-0624238 .

Here we use state-by-age modeling to capture individual heterogeneity in crossing one of three different poverty thresholds (defined as 1×, 2× or 3× the “official” poverty threshold) at each age. We examine age-specific state structure, the remaining life expectancy, its variance, and cohort simulations for those above and below each threshold. Survival and transitioning probabilities are statistically estimated by regression analyses of data from the Health and Retirement Survey RAND data-set, and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Using the results of these regression analyses, we parameterize discrete state, discrete age matrix models. We found that individuals above all three thresholds have higher annual survival than those in poverty, especially for mid-ages to about age 80. The advantage is greatest when we classify individuals based on 1× the “official” poverty threshold. The greatest discrepancy in average remaining life expectancy and its variance between those above and in poverty occurs at mid-ages for all three thresholds. And fewer individuals are in poverty between ages 40-60 for all three thresholds. Our findings are consistent with results based on other data sets, but also suggest that dynamic heterogeneity in poverty and the transience of the poverty state is associated with income-related mortality disparities (less transience, especially of those above poverty, more disparities). This paper applies the approach of age-by-stage matrix models to human demography and individual poverty dynamics. In so doing we extend the literature on individual poverty dynamics across the life course. © 2018 Bernstein et al.

The Hawai'i Biocomplexity Project has used the Hawaiian archipelago and more specifically the Leeward Kohala Field System (LKFS) as a model system to investigate the dynamic, often non-linear interactions among soils, agricultural systems, populations, and sociopolitical systems over time scales of several centuries. Two major models have been developed: (1) a model of spatial and temporal variability in agricultural production; and (2) a model of food availability and its linkages to population fertility and mortality. Empirically derived field data were used both to parameterize the models, and to test their predictions. Archaeological data on the distribution and variation in ancient agricultural field infrastructure, derived from high-resolution LiDAR images, were used to test predictions of agricultural production and intensity. Similarly, chronological data on numbers of ancient households derived from archaeological excavation and radiocarbon dating were used to test model predictions of population growth over time. This iterative process of building and testing models has led to improved understanding of how pre-industrial agricultural systems were intensified, and how expansion and intensification were dynamically linked to demographic changes in farming populations. © 2011.","CENTURY; Food ratio; Paleodemography; Polynesian archaeology; Sustainability","Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kohala; United States; Agriculture; Forecasting; Optical radar; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Agricultural fields; Agricultural intensification; Agricultural productions; Agricultural system; Archaeological excavations; Biocomplexity; CENTURY; Demographic changes; Field data; Food availability; High-resolution lidar; Iterative process; Malthusian; Model system; Nonlinear interactions; Paleodemography; Polynesian archaeology; Population change; Population growth; Pre-industrial; Radiocarbon dating; Spatial and temporal variability; Test models; Testing models; Time-scales; agricultural intensification; agricultural production; archaeology; chronology; demographic history; farming system; fertility; food availability; lidar; model test; population dynamics; prediction; radiocarbon dating; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; Geologic models","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (BCS-0119819, BCS-0624238); National Science Foundation, NSF","The research described in this paper was supported by National Science Foundation Grants BCS-0119819 and BCS-0624238 .

How and why does mortality change generate this diversity? We derive a precise link between changes in age-specific mortality and lifespan inequality, measured as the variance of age at death. Key to this relationship is a young-old threshold age, below and above which mortality decline respectively decreases and increases lifespan inequality. First, we show for Sweden that shifts in the threshold's location have modified the correlation between changes in life expectancy and lifespan inequality over the last two centuries. Second, we analyze the post-World War II (WWII) trajectories of lifespan inequality in a set of developed countries-Japan, Canada, and the United States-where thresholds centered on retirement age. Our method reveals how divergence in the age pattern of mortality change drives international divergence in lifespan inequality. Most strikingly, early in the 1980s, mortality increases in young U.S. males led to a continuation of high lifespan inequality in the United States; in Canada, however, the decline of inequality continued. In general, our wider international comparisons show that mortality change varied most at young working ages after WWII, particularly for males. We conclude that if mortality continues to stagnate at young ages yet declines steadily at old ages, increases in lifespan inequality will become a common feature of future demographic change. © 2014 Population Association of America.","Disparity; Health; Longevity; Retirement; Social policy","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Developed Countries; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Retirement; Sex Distribution; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; article; developed country; female; health disparity; human; life expectancy; male; middle aged; mortality; retirement; sex ratio; statistics; young adult","","","","","National Institutes of Health; Stanford Center for Population Research; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (AG22500); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R24AG039345); National Institute on Aging, NIA","This project is funded by the National Institutes of Health Grants AG22500 and AG039345 to Shripad Tuljapurkar, and by the Stanford Center for Population Research.

In temporally varying environments, elasticity is often calculated from simulations that assume a probability distribution for the environmental states.

Using a time-series of demographic matrices and age-structure we construct a consistent statistical estimator of elasticity that converges to the correct limiting value as the sample length increases. We also construct confidence intervals for elasticities from temporal data and suggest tools for testing hypotheses about the strength of selection.

Within a population, the distribution of phenotypic traits depends upon their transmission from parents to offspring, yet we still have a limited understanding of the factors shaping phenotypic transmission in wild populations. Phenotypic transmission can be measured using the phenotypic parent–offspring correlation (C), defined as the slope of the regression of offspring phenotypic trait on parental phenotypic trait, both traits measured at the same age, often at birth. This correlation reflects phenotypic variation due to both additive genetic effects and parental effects. Researchers seldom account for the possible influence of selection on estimates of the phenotypic parent–offspring correlation. However, because individuals must grow, survive, and reproduce before giving birth to offspring, these, aphic processes might influence the phenotypic parent–offspring correlation in addition to the inheritance process, the latter being the direct relationship between parental and offspring phenotypic traits when the parental trait is measured at age of reproduction and the offspring trait is measured at birth. Here we used a female-based population model to study the relative effects of fertility and viability selections, trait ontogeny and inheritance on C. The relative influence of each demographic process is estimated by deriving the exact formulas for the proportional changes in C to changes in the parameters of integral projection models structured by age and phenotypic traits. We illustrate our method for two long-lived species. We find that C can be strongly affected by both viability and fertility selections, mediated by growth and inheritance. Generally, demographic processes that result in mothers reproducing at similar phenotypic traits regardless of their birth traits, such as high fertility selection or converging developmental trajectories, lead to a decreased C. More generally, our models show how the age and phenotypic dependence of fertility and viability selections can influence phenotypic mother–offspring correlation to a much larger extent than ontogeny and inheritance. Our results suggest that accounting for such dependence is needed to model the distribution of offspring phenotypic traits and the ecoevolutionary dynamics of phenotypic traits reliably. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America","heritability; inheritance; integral projection model; parent–offspring covariance; parent–offspring regression; phenotypic variance; roe deer; Soay sheep; transmission","Capreolus; correlation; demography; fertility; lead; phenotype; reproduction","","","","","International Max Planck Research Network on Aging; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R21AG06163901); Natural Environment Research Council, NERC; European Research Council, ERC","JAB acknowledges funding from the International Max Planck Research Network on Aging (MaxNetAging).

Though many comprehensive studies have been carried out in Africa and Southeast Asia to characterize and examine determinants of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria pathogenesis, fewer have been conducted in India. Methods: A prospective study of malaria-positive individuals was conducted at Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC) from 2012 to 2015 to identify demographic, diagnostic and clinical indicators associated with P. falciparum and P. vivax infection on univariate analysis. Results: Between 2012 and 2015, 74,571 febrile individuals, 6287 (8.4%) of whom were malaria positive, presented to GMC. The total number of malaria cases at GMC increased more than two-fold over four years, with both P. vivax and P. falciparum cases present year-round. Some 1116 malaria-positive individuals (mean age = 27, 91% male), 88.2% of whom were born outside of Goa and 51% of whom were construction workers, were enroled in the study. Of 1088 confirmed malaria-positive patients, 77.0% had P. vivax, 21.0% had P. falciparum and 2.0% had mixed malaria. Patients over 40 years of age and with P. falciparum infection were significantly (p < 0.001) more likely to be hospitalised than younger and P. vivax patients, respectively. While approximately equal percentages of hospitalised P. falciparum (76.6%) and P. vivax (78.9%) cases presented with at least one WHO severity indicator, a greater percentage of P. falciparum inpatients presented with at least two (43.9%, p < 0.05) and at least three (29.9%, p < 0.01) severity features. There were six deaths among the 182 hospitalised malaria positive patients, all of whom had P. falciparum. Conclusion: During the four year study period at GMC, the number of malaria cases increased substantially and the greatest burden of severe disease was contributed by P. falciparum. © 2016 The Author(s).","Characteristics; Diagnostics; Epidemiology; Features; Goa; MESA-ICEMR; Severity","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Demography; Female; Humans; Incidence; India; Infant; Malaria, Falciparum; Malaria, Vivax; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Tertiary Care Centers; Young Adult; adult; age; Article; clinical feature; clinical indicator; construction worker; death; disease severity; female; fever; hospitalization; human; India; major clinical study; malaria falciparum; male; parasite load; parasitemia; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; prospective study; tertiary care center; univariate analysis; adolescent; aged; child; demography; incidence; infant; malaria falciparum; middle aged; pathology; Plasmodium vivax malaria; preschool child; tertiary care center; young adult","","","","","National Institute of Malaria Research; US NIAID, (U19 AI089688); University of Washington Institute of Trans‑ lational Health Science; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (UL1 RR02514); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (U19AI089688); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID; University of Washington, UW; Institute of Translational Health Sciences, ITHS; Indian Council of Medical Research, ICMR","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the US NIAID MESA‑ICEMR Program Project U19 AI089688 to PKR of the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, and by the Government of India (Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Malaria Research).

Although demographic rates of trees are impacted by recurrent harvest of plant organs (e.g. fruit, leaf, bark) known as non-timber forest products, the effect of such harvesting on life-history traits is less explored. Here, we investigate how different strategies of foliage and bark harvest by local people affect life expectancy and age at maturity of Khaya senegalensis across two climatic regions in West Africa. We compare elasticities of life expectancy to perturbation of vital rates to the elasticities of population growth rate, emphasizing how the two kinds of elasticity address distinct biological issues and management goals. Life expectancy was shorter and reproduction delayed in the dry than in the moist region, indicating a cost of drought to life-history traits. Harvesting at constant rates only affects (increased) life expectancy in the moist region and (reduced) age at first reproduction in the dry region. Models in which harvest intensity varies stochastically over time show results similar to those with constant harvesting rate. However, there is an interactive effect of harvest on life-history traits between regions. Increasing harvesting pressure accelerates maturity and reduces life expectancy in the dry region but delays reproduction and increases life expectancy in the moist region. This indicates that stochasticity magnifies the effect of harvesting on life-history traits. With the notable exception of heavily harvested populations in the moist region, life expectancy is more elastic to survival of early rather than late life stages. This pattern contrasts with the elasticity of population growth rate; the latter is more elastic to survival of late rather than early life stages. Synthesis. Our results suggest that plant harvesting can affect life-history traits but in different ways across an environmental gradient. Failure to account for stochasticity in harvesting rate can mask some of these effects. Our results also indicate that processes driving plant life expectancy, at least for long-lived species, may differ from those driving population dynamics.

In particular, we extend the Gompertz law by proposing a multi-factor exponential model, a framework that is able to capture flexible mortality patterns, and allows for a convenient estimation and prediction algorithm. An extensive empirical analysis is conducted using the proposed framework with a merged mortality database containing a large number of countries and regions with credible old-age mortality data. We find that the proposed exponential model leads to superior goodness-of-fit to historical data, and better out-of-sample forecasting performance. Moreover, the exponential model predicts more balanced mortality improvements across ages, and thus leads to higher projected remaining life expectancy for the old ages than existing Gompertz-based mortality models. Finally, the modeling capacity of the proposed exponential model is further demonstrated by a multi-population extension, and an illustrative example of estimation and forecast is provided. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Factor model; Gompertz law; Mortality curvature; Mortality plateau; Old age mortality forecasting","","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (DGECR-2020-00347, RGPIN-2020-05387)","The authors would like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewer for providing valuable and insightful comments on the earlier drafts.

Stochastic elasticity of the long-run stochastic growth rate λs to a demographic parameter offers a suitable way to measure the overall demographic response because it includes both the direct effect of changing the demographic parameter and its indirect effect through changes in the age structure. From 25 mammalian populations with contrasting life histories, we investigated how pace of life and population growth rate influence the demographic responses (measured as the relative contributions of the direct and indirect components of stochastic elasticity on λs). We found that in short-lived species, the change in population structure resulting from an increase in yearling survival leads to an additional increase in λs, whereas in long-lived species, the same change in population structure leads to a decrease. Short-lived species thus display a boom-bust life history strategy contrary to long-lived species, for which the long lifespan dampens the demographic consequences of changing age structure. Irrespective of the species' life history strategy, the change in population age structure resulting from an increase in adult survival leads to an additional increase in λs due to an increase of the proportion of mature individuals in the population. On the contrary, a change in population age structure resulting from an increase of reproductive performance leads to a decrease in λs that is due to the increase of the proportion of immature individuals in the population. Our comparative analysis of stochastic elasticity patterns in mammals shows the existence of different demographic responses to changes in age structure between short- and long-lived species, which improves our understanding of population dynamics in variable environments in relation to the species-specific pace of life. © 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.","","Mammalia; age structure; comparative study; demographic trend; environmental effect; growth rate; life history; population growth; reproductive productivity; survival","","","","","French National Agency for Wildlife; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R24AG039345); Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/E015921/1, NE/G004390/1, NE/G004390/2, NE/H007148/1, NE/H007148/2, NE/I023783/1, NE/I023783/2, NE/I023791/1, NE/I023791/2, NE/K014218/1); European Research Council, ERC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the French National Agency for Wildlife (ONCFS).

When environments are fixed and there is one most favorable site, migration to other sites lowers overall growth rate and is not favored. Here we ask, can environmental variability favor migration when there is one best site on average? Previous work suggests that the answer is yes, but a general and precise answer remained elusive. Here we establish new, rigorous inequalities to show (and use simulations to illustrate) how stochastic growth rate can increase with migration when fitness (dis)advantages fluctuate over time across sites. The effect of migration between sites on the overall stochastic growth rate depends on the difference in expected growth rates and the variance of the fluctuating difference in growth rates. When fluctuations (variance) are large, a population can benefit from bursts of higher growth in sites that are worse on average. Such bursts become more probable as the between-site variance increases. Our results apply to many (≥ 2) sites, and reveal an interplay between the length of paths between sites, the average differences in site-specific growth rates, and the size of fluctuations. Our findings have implications for evolutionary biology as they provide conditions for departure from the reduction principle, and for ecological dynamics: even when there are superior sites in a sea of poor habitats, variability and habitat quality across space determine the importance of migration. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Dispersal; Evolution of migration; Migration; Reduction principle; Stochastic growth rates; Temporal variation; Variable environments","Animal Migration; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Population Dynamics; Stochastic Processes; dispersal; evolutionary biology; fitness; growth rate; population migration; stochasticity; temporal variation; animal; ecosystem; evolution; population dynamics; population migration; stochastic model","","","","","Siddharth Srinivasan; Stanford University, SU","HJ would like to thank Siddharth Srinivasan for the very helpful discussions that enabled a better understanding of the mathematics and large deviation theory.

We decompose short-term elasticity as a sum of (i) the effect of the perturbation in rates on the unperturbed population structure and (ii) the effect of the original vital rates on the difference in structure between the original and the perturbed population. We provide exact analytical formulas for these components. In a population at its stable stage distribution (SSD), short-term elasticity is determined mainly by the SSD and reproductive value. In a non-stable population, short-term elasticity depends also on the projection of initial structure on the SSD, equal to population momentum. Non-stable stage structures matter most to elasticity if stages are missing that take time to fill in. We show how the demographic damping rate of the original population determines the rate at which short-term elasticity converges to its limiting values. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Demographic damping; Generation time; Initial structure; Population growth rate; Reproductive value; Short-term elasticity; Stable stage distribution","Animals; Birds; Cactaceae; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Time Factors; demography; elasticity; generation time; growth rate; population growth; population structure; animal; article; biological model; bird; Cactaceae; ecosystem; physiology; population density; population dynamics; time","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG022500)","","Caswell H., Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis and Interpretation, (2001); Caswell H., Sensitivity analysis of transient population dynamics, Ecol Lett., 10, pp. 1-15, (2007); Charlesworth B., Evolution in Age Structured Populations., (1994); Coulson T., Guinness F., Pemberton J., Clutton-Brock T.H., The demographic consequences of releasing a population of red deer from culling, Ecology, 85, pp. 411-422, (2004); Easterling M.R., Ellner S.P., Dixon P.M., Size-specific sensitivity: Applying a new structured population model, Ecology, 81, pp. 694-708, (2000); Fefferman N.H., Reed J.M., A vital rate sensitivity analysis for nonstable age distributions and short-term planning, Jr. Wild.

Box 9010, Netherlands; Tuljapurkar S., Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, United States","Life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses have been widely used to examine the sources of differences in the long-term deterministic growth rate (r = log ) of stage-structured populations that live in spatially distinct habitats or under distinct experimental conditions. However, existing methods for LTRE analysis ignore the fact that persistent temporal variation in matrix elements results in a long-term stochastic growth rate (a = log s) that is different from the deterministic growth rate (r) and thus do not take into account environmental stochasticity. Here, we develop a stochastic extension of LTRE methods that can be used to compare stochastic growth rates among populations that differ in the observed variability of their matrix elements over time. We illustrate our method with actual data and explore a range of questions that may be addressed with these new tools. Specifically, we investigate how variability in weather conditions affected the population dynamics of the short-lived perennial plant species Anthyllis vulneraria and examine how differences in stochastic growth rates (a) are determined by contributions of mean matrix elements and variability in matrix elements. We find that, consistent with the life history of the species, differences in mean fertility and growth made the largest contribution to differences in a, whereas in terms of variability fertility made the largest contribution in most populations. However, we also find that in all populations, the magnitude of the total contribution of mean matrix elements outweighed that of variability. Finally, increasing soil depth significantly lowered contributions of variability in matrix elements, but it was not related to contributions of differences in mean matrix elements. Synthesis. Stochastic life table response experiment analysis described here provides the first systematic way of incorporating observed differences in temporal variability into the comparison of natural populations. A key finding from this study is that populations occurring on relatively deeper soils were better buffered against climatic variation than populations occurring on shallow soils. We expect this new approach to analyse temporal variability to prove especially useful in the analysis of natural populations experiencing environmental change. © 2010 The Authors.

Food production requires labor; thus, dependence of survival and fertility on food involves dependence of a population's future on its current state. We use a perturbation approach to analyze the effects of random environmental variation on this nonlinear, age-structured system. We show that in expanding populations, direct environmental effects dominate induced population fluctuations, so environmental variability has little effect on mean hunger levels, although it does decrease population growth. The growth rate determines the time until population is limited by space. This limitation introduces a tradeoff between population density and well-being, so population effects become more important than the direct effects of the environment: environmental fluctuation increases mortality, releasing density dependence and raising average well-being for survivors. We discuss the social implications of these findings for the long-term fate of populations as they transition from expansion into limitation, given that conditions leading to high well-being during growth depress well-being during limitation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

These generalizations have been challenged because of limitations of life-table approaches and the growing appreciation that senescence is more than an increasing probability of death. Without using life tables, we examine senescence rates in annual individual fitness using 20 individual-based data sets of terrestrial vertebrates with contrasting life histories and body size. We find that senescence is widespread in the wild and equally likely to occur in survival and reproduction. Additionally, mammals senesce faster than birds because they have a faster life history for a given body size. By allowing us to disentangle the effects of two major fitness components our methods allow an assessment of the robustness of the prevalent life-table approach. Focusing on one aspect of life history - survival or recruitment - can provide reliable information on overall senescence. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Aging; Comparative analysis; Demography; Generation time; Metabolic rate; Senescence","Aging; Animals; Birds; Body Size; Female; Mammals; Reproduction; Aves; Mammalia; Vertebrata; body size; comparative study; life history; life table; metabolism; reproduction; senescence; survival; vertebrate; aging; animal; article; bird; body size; comparative study; female; mammal; physiology; reproduction","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG022500)","","Akaike H., Information theory as an extension of the maximum likelihood principle, Second International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281, (1973); Angelier F., Weimerskirch H., Dano S., Chastel O., Age, experience and reproductive performance in a long-lived bird: A hormonal perspective, Behav.

Some argue that old-Age deaths should become compressed at advanced ages, others argue that old-Age deaths should become more dispersed with age, and yet others argue that old-Age deaths are consistent with little change in dispersion. However, direct analysis of old-Age deaths presents unusual challenges: Death rates at the oldest ages are always noisy, published life tables must assume an asymptotic age pattern of deaths, and the definition of ""old-Age"" changes as lives lengthen. Here we use robust percentile-based methods to overcome some of these challenges and show, for five decades in 20 developed countries, that old-Age survival follows an advancing front, like a traveling wave. The front lies between the 25th and 90th percentiles of old-Age deaths, advancing with nearly constant long-Term shape but annual fluctuations in speed. The existence of this front leads to several predictions that we verify, e.g., that advances in life expectancy at age 65 y are highly correlated with the advance of the 25th percentile, but not with distances between higher percentiles. Our unexpected result has implications for biological hypotheses about human aging and for future mortality change. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

Increasing variance will increase the width of confidence bounds around estimates of population size, growth, probability of and time to quasi-extinction. However, traditional sensitivity analyses of stochastic matrix models only consider the sensitivity of the mean growth rate. We derive an exact method for calculating the sensitivity of the variance in population growth to changes in demographic parameters. Sensitivities of the variance also allow a new sensitivity calculation for the cumulative probability of quasi-extinction. We apply this new analysis tool to an empirical dataset on at-risk polar bears to demonstrate its utility in conservation biology. We find that in many cases a change in life history parameters will increase both the mean and variance of population growth of polar bears. This counterintuitive behaviour of the variance complicates predictions about overall population impacts of management interventions. Sensitivity calculations for cumulative extinction risk factor in changes to both mean and variance, providing a highly useful quantitative tool for conservation management. The mean stochastic growth rate and its sensitivities do not fully describe the dynamics of population growth. The use of variance sensitivities gives a more complete understanding of population dynamics and facilitates the calculation of new sensitivities for extinction processes. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","Conservation; Extinction; Polar bears; Population growth; Population viability; Sensitivity; Stochastic matrix model; Variance of population growth","","","","","","","","Aberg P., Svensson C.J., Caswell H., Pavia H., Environment-specific elasticity and sensitivity analysis of the stochastic growth rate, Ecological Modelling, 220, pp. 605-610, (2009); Beissinger S.R., McCullough D.R., Population viability analysis, (2002); Boyce M.S., Haridas C.V., Lee C.T., Demography in an increasingly variable world, Trends Ecol.

We deal with linear stochastic models, and their analysis is also essential to the analysis of nonlinear stochastic models, particularly their boundary behavior which determines invasion, extinction, and persistence. The models discussed here operate in discrete time, and describe individuals who can be in one of the many finite stages. The analyses described here also apply to other discrete-time models, known as integral population models, under suitable conditions. These models are naturally framed in terms of products of random matrices, and so are connected to models used in a number of other areas of science. We explain the assumptions and structure of the models, how they are constructed, and how they may be analyzed. We focus on two kinds of random environments, those that are independently identically distributed (IID), and finite-state Markov chains, but many of the results also apply to other environmental processes. We give examples to illustrate the theory. We also discuss the computation of derivatives of the stochastic growth rate for our models. Code (in R) to compute these derivatives will soon appear as a package; until then, the code is available from the authors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Derivatives of stochastic growth rate; Long-run growth rate; Lyapunov exponent; Random matrix product; Small-noise approximation; Stochastic population dynamics; Stochastic vital rates; Structured populations","","","","","","","","Arnold L., Kliemann W., Oeljeklaus E., Lyapunov exponents of linear stochastic systems, Lyapunov Exponents, pp. 85-125, (1986); Bellman R., Et al., Limit theorems for non-commutative operations.

There are two basic steps in the proposed new analysis: one relates trait values to fitness components, and the other relates fitness components to total fitness. We used one population projection matrix for each state of the environment together with a model of environmental dynamics, defining total fitness as the stochastic growth rate. We multiplied environment-specific, stage-specific meanstandardized selection gradients by environment-specific, stage-specific elasticities of the stochastic growth rate, summing over all relevant life-history and environmental paths. Our two example traits were floral tube length in a rainforest herb and the timing of birth in red deer. For each species, we constructed two models of environmental dynamics, including one based on historical climate records. We found that total integrated selection, as well as the relative contributions of life-history pathways and environments, varied with environmental dynamics. Temporal patterning in the environment has selective consequences. Linking models of environmental change to relevant short-term data on demography and selection may permit estimation of the force of selection over the long term in variable environments. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Climate and demography; Environment-specific elasticity; Integrated elasticity; Structured populations; Variable selection gradients","Cervus elaphus; birth date; deer; demography; environmental change; fitness; growth rate; herb; life history trait; phenotypic plasticity; population structure; rainforest; stochasticity","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (249872); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","","Aberg P., Svensson C.J., Caswell H., Paviac H., Environmentspecific elasticity and sensitivity analysis of the stochastic growth rate, Ecol Model, 220, pp. 605-610, (2009); Arnold S.J., Wade M.J., On the measurement of natural and sexual selection: Applications, Evolution, 38, pp. 720-734, (1984); On the measurement of natural and sexual selection: Theory, Evolution, 38, pp. 709-719, (1984); Caswell H., Matrix population models: Construction, analysis and interpretation. 2nd ed.

This chapter provides a critical summary of the central ideas and methods. The authors emphasise theoretical methods, starting with the main ideas that have attracted attention in the field, the assumptions behind these, and efforts to relax those assumptions, and provide a short account of some new directions. The chapter begins with the classic work of Peter Medawar and William Hamilton and discusses the connections, applications, assumptions, and limitations related to their ideas and results, e.g. sensitivity and corresponding elasticity of growth rate on fertility and survival. It highlights extensions to variable environments and the large body of theory around that topic. Next the chapter discusses how these theoretical methods are related to analyses and theories of post-reproductive life, via the general concept of ‘borrowing fitness’. Finally, the chapter discusses nonlinear models of mutation and selection and density-dependent models. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Autocorrelation; Density-dependent models; Elasticity; Life history evolution; Sensitivity; Variable environments","","","","","","","","Abrams P.A., Density-Independent Mortality and Interspecific Competition: A Test of Pianka's Niche Overlap Hypothesis, The American Naturalist, 111, 979, pp. 539-552, (1977); Abrams P.A., Consumer Functional Response and Competition in Consumer Resource Systems, Theoretical Population Biology, 17, 1, pp. 80-102, (1980); Abrams P.A., Functional Responses of Optimal Foragers, The American Naturalist, 120, 3, pp. 382-390, (1982); Abrams P.A., The Effects of Adaptive Behavior on the Type-2 Functional Response, Ecology, 71, 3, pp. 877-885, (1990); Abrams P.A., Why Predation Rate Should Not be Proportional to Predator Density, Ecology, 74, 3, pp. 726-733, (1993); Abrams P.A., High Competition with Low Similarity and Low Competition with High Similarity: Exploitative and Apparent Competition in Consumer-Resource Systems, The American Naturalist, 152, 1, pp. 114-128, (1998); Abrams P.A., The Evolution of Predator-Prey Interactions: Theory and Evidence, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, 1, pp. 79-105, (2000); Abrams P.A., The Effect of Density-Independent Mortality on the Coexistence of Exploitative Competitors for Renewing Resources, The American Naturalist, 158, 5, pp. 459-470, (2001); Abrams P.A., Defining and Measuring the Impact of Dynamic Traits on Interspecific Interactions, Ecology, 88, 10, pp. 2555-2562, (2007); Abrams P.A., Determining the Functional Form of Density Dependence: Deductive Approaches for Consumer Resource Systems Having a Single Resource, The American Naturalist, 174, 3, pp. 321-330, (2009); Abrams P.A., The Implications of Using Multiple Resources for Consumer Density Dependence, Evolutionary Ecology Research, 11, pp. 517-540, (2009); Abrams P.A., How Does the Evolution of Universal Ecological Traits Affect Population Size?

This model provides a quantitative framework to describe how environment, technology, and culture interact to influence the fates of preindustrial agricultural populations. We present equilibrium conditions and derive approximations for the equilibrium population growth rate, food availability, and other food-dependent measures of population well-being. We examine how the approximations respond to environmental changes and to human choices, and find that the impact of environmental quality depends upon whether it manifests through agricultural yield or maximum (food-independent) survival rates. Human choices can complement or offset environmental effects: greater labor investments increase both population growth and well-being, and therefore can counteract lower agricultural yield, while fertility control decreases the growth rate but can increase or decrease well-being. Finally we establish equilibrium stability criteria, and argue that the potential for loss of local stability at low population growth rates could have important consequences for populations that suffer significant environmental or demographic shocks. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The role of genetic versus environmental factors in explaining TL by race and socioeconomic position (SEP) remains unclear. Methods We used data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (N = 11,934) to test the hypothesis that there are differences in TL-associated SNPs by race and SEP. We constructed a TL polygenic risk score (PRS) and examined its association with race/ethnicity, educational attainment, assets, gender, and age. Results U.S. blacks were more likely to have a lower PRS for TL, as were older individuals and men. Racial differences in TL were statistically accounted for when controlling for population structure using genetic principal components. The GWAS-derived SNPs for TL, however, may not have consistent associations with TL across different racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions This study showed that associations of race/ethnicity with TL differed when accounting for population stratification. The role of race/ethnicity for TL remains uncertain, however, as the genetic determinants of TL may differ by race/ethnicity. Future GWAS samples should include racially diverse participants to allow for better characterization of the determinants of TL in human populations. © 2016 Forschungsgesellschaft für Arbeitsphysiologie und Arbeitschutz e.V.","Polygenic risk score; Race; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Socioeconomic position; Telomere; Telomere length","Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alleles; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Markers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Population Surveillance; Socioeconomic Factors; Telomere Homeostasis; United States; genetic marker; age; aged; Article; biodiversity; educational status; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic marker; health survey; human; male; polymerase chain reaction; population research; priority journal; race difference; risk assessment; scoring system; sex difference; socioeconomics; telomere length; allele; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; ethnic group; genetics; genome-wide association study; geriatric assessment; health survey; middle aged; single nucleotide polymorphism; socioeconomics; telomere homeostasis; United States; very elderly","","Genetic Markers, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (K01-AG047280, R24AG039345); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (KL2TR001083)","Dr. Hamad is supported by a KL2 Mentored Career Development Award through the Stanford Clinical and Translational Science Award to Spectrum (KL2-TR001083).

However, this understanding is crucial to comprehend evolutionary and ecological population dynamics. In structured populations, individual life courses represent sequences of stages that end in death. These life course trajectories or sequences can be described by a Markov chain and individuals diversify over the course of their lives by transitioning through diverse discrete stages. The rate at which stage sequences diversify with age can be quantified by the population entropy of a Markov chain. Here, we derive sensitivities of the population entropy of a Markov chain to identify which stage transitions generate – or contribute – most to diversification in stage sequences, i.e. life courses. We then use these sensitivities to reveal potential selective forces on the dynamics of life courses. To do so we correlated the sensitivity of each matrix element (stage transition) with respect to the population entropy, to its sensitivity with respect to fitness λ, the population growth rate. Positive correlation between the two sensitivities would suggest that the stage transitions that selection has acted most strongly on (high sensitivities with respect to λ) are also those that contributed most to the diversification of life courses. Using an illustrative example on a seabird population, the Thick-billed Murres on Coats Island, that is structured by reproductive stages, we show that the most influential stage transitions for diversification of life courses are not correlated with the most influential transitions for population growth. Our finding suggests that observed diversification in life courses is neutral rather than adaptive, note this does not imply that the life histories themselves are not adaptive. We are at an early stage of understanding how individual level dynamics shape ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and many discoveries await. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biodemography; Life course; Life history evolution; Neutral variability; Population entropy; Sensitivity","Biological Evolution; Entropy; Humans; Markov Chains; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Canada; Coats Island; Nunavut; Uria lomvia; correlation; ecological approach; evolutionary theory; fitness; life history; Markov chain; population growth; seabird; entropy; evolution; human; Markov chain; population dynamics; reproduction","","","","","","","Barton N.H., Etheridge A.M., Veber A., The infinitesimal model: Definition, derivation, and implications, Theor.

Despite this hierarchical structure, there is a paucity of analytical models and theory linking the dynamics of individuals within colonies to the dynamics of a population of colonies. We present an analytical framework that provides a simple, robust, and predictive theory for the population dynamics of hierarchical organisms. Our framework explicitly describes and links demographic dynamics for the different levels in the hierarchy (individuals, groups, population). We illustrate the application of the framework by developing a model for honey bees and analyzing the effects of life history traits such as worker life span and size at swarming on the growth rate of populations. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the model that increase its realism and expand its usefulness beyond swarm-founding, monogynous, eusocial insects. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Apis mellifera;

During demographic transitions, kinship networks are reshaped by changes in mortality and fertility rates. OBJECTIVE This paper analyzes consanguineous and female kin and explores the effect on the size and structure of living kin before and after a demographic transition. We compute the kinship network of a female individual with average demographic traits (here called the Focal) at all ages but focus on only demographically dense ages (age 15 to 39). METHODS The analysis uses a time-invariant model (Caswell 2019) to calculate the expected number of living kin using fertility and mortality rates. We use three examples (China, India, and Japan) with fertility and mortality from World Population Prospect 2019, based on empirical data. CONCLUSIONS We highlight two key results. First, at a demographically dense age of the Focal, the maximum expected number of living aunts, sisters, or daughters is approximately the net reproductive rate R0 (linear), while the number of living cousins is approximately R02 (quadratic). Second, such effects on kinship size depend on the magnitude of fertility change and on the age-pattern of changes in mortality. And the effects of fertility and mortality on the number of kin are not additive. CONTRIBUTION This paper shows a simple relationship between demographic transition and kinship size, which makes it possible to estimate kinship size based on the net reproductive rate. The quadratic relationship between the number of certain kin (e.g., cousins, nieces) and the net reproductive rate is informative but not a priori obvious. © 2023 Sha Jiang et al","","","","","","","","","Andersson L., Kolk M., Kinship and socioeconomic status: Social gradients in frequencies of kin across the life course in Sweden, (2022);

In particular, mothers in good condition in polygynous and dimorphic species are predicted to produce an excess of sons, whereas mothers in poor condition should do the opposite. Despite the elegance of the theory, support for it has been limited2,3. Here we extend and generalize the Trivers-Willard theory to explain the disparity between predictions and observations of offspring sex ratio. In polygynous species, males typically have higher mortality rates4, different age-specific reproductive schedules and more risk-prone life history tactics than females; however, these differences are not currently incorporated into the Trivers-Willard theory. Using two-sex models parameterized with data from free-living mammal populations with contrasting levels of sex differences in demography, we demonstrate how sex differences in life history traits over the entire lifespan can lead to a wide range of sex allocation tactics, and show that correlations between maternal condition and offspring sex ratio alone are insufficient to conclude that mothers adaptively adjust offspring sex ratio.","","Adaptation, Biological; Aging; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Male; Models, Biological; Mortality; Mothers; Reproducibility of Results; Reproduction; Risk-Taking; Sciuridae; Sex Characteristics; Sex Ratio; Sheep; Mammalia; demography; dimorphism; evolutionary theory; fitness; life history trait; mammal; map generalization; polygyny; reproduction; sex allocation; sex ratio; sex-related difference; Article; female; fitness; male; mortality; nonhuman; priority journal; progeny; sex allocation; sex difference; sex ratio; theory; trivers willard theory; adaptation; aging; animal; animal behavior; biological model; high risk behavior; mortality; mother; physiology; reproducibility; reproduction; Sciuridae; sexual development; sheep","","","","","European Commission; Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/I023783/2, NE/K014218/1)","","Trivers R.L., Willard D.E., Natural selection of parental ability to vary the sex ratio of offspring, Science, 179, pp. 90-92, (1973); Hewison A.J.M., Gaillard J.-M., Successful sons or advantaged daughters? the Trivers-Willard model and sex-biased maternal investment in ungulates, Trends Ecol.

Along a life-history spectrum from low-survival/high- fertility species to high-survival/low-fertility species, we show that the latter are more likely to evolve delayed reproduction if fertility varies over time. By contrast, if survival varies over time, low-survival life histories are more likely to evolve delays. If there is variation in both survival and fertility, and if this variation is positively associated, the evolutionarily stable reproductive delay is decreased (relative to independent variation in survival and fertility). Conversely, if variation in survival and fertility is negatively associated, the evolutionarily stable reproductive delay is increased. We further show that environmental uncertainty can drive the evolution of delayed reproduction in an iteroparous organism but only in the special case where juvenile survival is greater than adult survival. For common iteroparous life histories (adult survival > juvenile survival), environmental uncertainty does not select for delayed reproduction. Thus, any benefits that delayed reproduction might have on reproduction or survival could be especially important in explaining the common observation of delayed reproduction in many vertebrates and perennial plants. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

However, understanding changes in disparity in age of death is important to understanding mechanisms of mortality improvement and devising policy to promote health equity. We derive a novel decomposition of variance in age of death, a measure of inequality, and apply it to cause-specific contributions to the change in variance among the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) from 1950 to 2010. We find that the causes of death that contributed most to declines in the variance are different from those that contributed most to increase in life expectancy; in particular, they affect mortality at younger ages. We also find that, for two leading causes of death [cancers and cardiovascular disease (CVD)], there are no consistent relationships between changes in life expectancy and variance either within countries over time or between countries. These results show that promoting health at younger ages is critical for health equity and that policies to control cancer and CVD may have differing implications for equity.","Age of death variance; Health equity; Inequality; Life expectancy; Mortality","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Canada; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; France; Germany; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Italy; Japan; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Neoplasms; United Kingdom; United States; Article; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; childhood mortality; health equity; health promotion; human; infection; injury; life expectancy; lifespan; maternal mortality; mortality rate; neoplasm; priority journal; sex difference; variance; adolescent; adult; aged; Canada; cause of death; child; female; France; Germany; health disparity; infant; Italy; Japan; life expectancy; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; trends; United Kingdom; United States; very elderly","","","","","Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R24AG039345)","We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments.

Accordingly, the social environment plays a fundamental role in the emergence of phenotypes driving the evolution of aging. Recent work placing human social gradients on a biological continuum with other species provides a useful evolutionary context for aging questions, but there is still a need for a unified evolutionary framework linking health and aging within social contexts. Here, we summarize current challenges to understand the role of the social environment in human life courses. Next, we review recent advances in comparative biodemography and propose a biodemographic perspective to address socially driven health phenotype distributions and their evolutionary consequences using a nonhuman primate population. This new comparative approach uses evolutionary demography to address the joint dynamics of populations, social dimensions, phenotypes, and life history parameters. The long-term goal is to advance our understanding of the link between individual social environments, population-level outcomes, and the evolution of aging. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Animal models; Biodemography; Cayo Santiago; Integral projection models; Multi-state models; Nonhuman primates; Rhesus macaques; Social dimensions","Aging; Animals; Humans; Social Environment; aging; demography; human; human experiment; life history; nonhuman; phenotype; review; rhesus monkey; social environment; animal","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2217812); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R21AG072285, R37AG049395); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R24 AG065172); National Institute on Aging, NIA; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (DFG 430170797); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","This work was supported by the Animal Models for the Social Dimensions of Health and Aging Research Network ( NIH/NIA R24 AG065172 ), the National Institutes of Health ( R37AG049395 and R21AG072285 ), the German Science Foundation ( DFG 430170797 ), and the National Science Foundation ( 2217812 ).

However, even among the most fecund populations, human fertility falls far below its theoretical maximum. The extent of parental care required for successful offspring recruitment and widespread fertility decline under proper economic conditions suggest that selection on fertility is constrained by trade-offs with recruitment. Here we measure the trade-offs between life history traits under selection by approximating the slope of the selective constraint curve on two traits at the observed values. Using a selection of populations that span human demographic space, we find that the substitution elasticity of fertility for infant survival shows age-related patterns, with minimum substitution elasticities ranging from 14 to 22 for the four populations. The age of this minimum occurs earlier in the high-mortality populations relative to generation time than it does in the low-mortality populations. The human curves are qualitatively similar to one of two comparable nonhuman primate age-specific substitution elasticity curves. The curve for rhesus macaques has a similar shape but is shifted down, meaning that the threshold for switching from investing in survival to fertility is lower at all ages. The magnitude of the substitution elasticities is similar between chimpanzees and humans but the shape is quite different, rising more slowly for a longer fraction of the chimpanzee life cycle. The steeply rising substitution elasticities with age in humans has clear implications for the evolution of reproductive senescence. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

Evolutionary theories predict that selection in constant environments acts against such heterogeneity. But observations reveal substantial non-genetic and also non-environmental variability in phenotypes. Here, we examine whether there is a relationship between selection pressure and phenotypic variability by analysing structured population models based on data from a large and diverse set of species. Our findings suggest that non-genetic, non-environmental variation is in general neither truly neutral, selected for, nor selected against. We find much variations among species and populations within species, with mean patterns suggesting nearly neutral evolution of life-course variability. Populations that show greater diversity of life courses do not show, in general, increased or decreased population growth rates. Our analysis suggests we are only at the beginning of understanding the evolution and maintenance of non-genetic non-environmental variation. © 2023 The Authors.

An important question in the analysis of these equations is the stability of the equilibrium values of the interacting variables. Most work with Lotka-Volterra models has considered only neighbourhood stability against small perturbations away from equilibrium. The question of global stability when large perturbations from equilibrium are involved has only been analysed in a few special cases2. We establish here that for the general Lotka-Volterra models local stability ensures global stability (asymptotic stability in the large). This result provides justification for the work that has been and is being done2,3 on linearised versions of the Lotka-Volterra models. © 1975 Nature Publishing Group.","","","","","","","","","God N.S., Maitra S.C., Montroll W., R Ev.

Hamilton quantified this argument by showing that a rate mutation reducing survival is opposed by a selective force that declines with age over reproductive life. He used a female-only demographic model, predicting that female menopause at age ca. 50 yrs should be followed by a sharp increase in mortality, a ""wall of death."" Human lives obviously do not display such a wall. Explanations of the evolution of lifespan beyond the age of female menopause have proven difficult to describe as explicit genetic models. Here we argue that the inclusion of males and mating patterns extends Hamilton's theory and predicts the pattern of human senescence. We analyze a general two-sex model to show that selection favors survival for as long as men reproduce. Male fertility can only result from matings with fertile females, and we present a range of data showing that males much older than 50 yrs have substantial realized fertility through matings with younger females, a pattern that was likely typical among early humans. Thus old-age male fertility provides a selective force against autosomal deleterious mutations at ages far past female menopause with no sharp upper age limit, eliminating the wall of death. Our findings illustrate the evolutionary importance of males and mating preferences, and show that one-sex demographic models are insufficient to describe the forces that shape human senescence. © 2007 Tuljapurkar et al.","","Evolution, Molecular; Female; Fertility; Humans; Longevity; Male; Menopause; Reproduction; Survival Rate; aging; article; autosomal inheritance; demography; evolution; gene deletion; gene mutation; human; lifespan; male; male fertility; mating; menopause; prediction; reproduction; survival; female; fertility; genetics; longevity; molecular evolution; physiology; reproduction; survival rate","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG024119)","","Hamilton W.D., The moulding of senescence by natural selection, J.

The impact of the high SRB will appear 29 years later, when about 9% of men will have no spouses. It is argued that it is highly likely that the SRB will continue to rise as long as a strong son preference and discrimination against women prevails. The preference for sons is based in part on the traditional expectation that males are responsible for supporting elderly parents. China has tried to offset this expectation by offering favorable treatment in the social security system to elderly without sons. Projections of first marriage rates are made based on 1990 data. The potential ratio of marriage and the potential ratio of first marriage are expected to rise in 1990, peak around 2000, and decline to a low in 2005. The high SRB in 1990 will increase the potential marriage ratios after 2010. Imbalances in first marriages (lack of matches between males and females) will be around 9% beginning after 2020. Changes in marriage age and the traditional age difference between husband and wife are unlikely to affect the deficits in spouses. It is confirmed that a rising SRB will not have a significant effect on the ratio between the population over 65 years who have no sons and the working-age population (NSDR). The current elderly dependency rate is three times higher than the NSDR in China. But in the US, the elderly dependency rate is higher than any current Chinese rate or future rate up to 2050.","","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Asia; Behavior; China; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Family Characteristics; Family Relations; Far East; Marriage; Nuclear Family; Old Age Assistance; Population; Population Characteristics; Psychology; Sex; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Sex Ratio; Social Values; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Asia; Behavior; China; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Relationships; Marriage; Microeconomic Factors; Nuptiality; Old Age Security; Population; Population Characteristics; Psychological Factors; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Sex Preference; Sex Ratio; Sons; Value Orientation; adult; age; aged; article; Asia; behavior; China; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; Economic Factors; economics; elderly care; Family And Household; family relation; Family Relationships; family size; Far East; marriage; Microeconomic Factors; nuclear family; nuptiality; Old Age Security; population; population and population related phenomena; Psychological Factors; psychology; sex; sex difference; Sex Preference; sex ratio; social psychology; Sons; Value Orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10448403","","","12290857","English","Chin J Popul Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029451155"

Environmental stochasticity can play a major role in population dynamics with consequences for population viability and the evolution of life-history traits. However, in empirical studies it is necessary to verify that environmental stochasticity is actually present and that the observed variability is not simply a consequence of sampling variation. 2. We propose a non-parametric method to detect environmental variability in demographic parameters of structured populations based on data randomization using an estimated Kullback-Leibler distance as a test statistic. 3. The Kullback-Leibler distance is an established information-theoretic measure of the deviance between distributions and we show, with empirical and simulated data sets, that it can be adapted effectively to detect variability in demographic fates among populations. 4. This metric has the potential to reveal the importance of relatively rare transitions for understanding temporal variability in demography that would not be revealed by log-linear analysis. 5. Synthesis: Using an estimated Kullback-Leibler distance as a test statistic allows variability at the level of demographic rates to be economically assessed as an adjunct to the randomization tests that many researchers currently perform to assess variability in λ, and would provide additional and complementary insight. © 2007 The Authors.","Demographic census; Environmental stochasticity; Kullback-Leibler; Matrix models; Randomization tests","demography; environmental change; modeling; population type; stochasticity; temporal variation","","","","","","","Adams D.C., Anthony C.D., Using randomization techniques to analyse behavioural data, Animal Behavior, 51, pp. 733-738, (1996); Agresti A., Categorical Data Analysis, (2002); Brault S., Caswell H., Pod-specific demography of killer whales (Orcinus orca, Ecology (Washington DC), 74, pp. 1444-1454, (1993); Burnham K.P., Anderson D.R., Model Selection and Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approah., (1998); Caswell H., Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis, and Interpretation, (2001); Claessen D., Alternative life-history pathways and the elasticity of stochastic matrix models, American Naturalist, 165, (2005); Freville H., Colas B., Riba M., Caswell H., Mignot A., Imbert E., Olivieri I., Spatial and temporal demographic variability in the endemic plant species Centaurea corymbosa (Asteraceae), Ecology (Washington DC), 85, pp. 694-703, (2004); Gould W.R., Nichols J.D., Estimation of temporal variability of survival in animal populations, Ecology (Washington DC), 79, pp. 2531-2538, (1998); Haridas C.V., Tuljapurkar S., Elasticities in variable environments: Properties and implications, American Naturalist, 166, pp. 481-495, (2005); Horvitz C.C., Schemske D.W., Spatiotemporal variation in demographic transitions of a tropical understory herb: Projection matrix analysis, Ecological Monographs, 65, pp. 155-192, (1995); Johnson N.L., Kotz S., Discrete Distributions., (1969); Kendall B.E., Estimating the magnitude of environmental stochasticity in survivorship data, Ecological Applications, 8, pp. 184-193, (1998); Koop A.L., Population Dynamics and Invasion Rate of An Invasive, Tropical Understory Shrub, Ardisia Elliptica, (2003); Koop A.L., Differential seed mortality among habitats limits the distribution of the invasive shrub Ardisia elliptica, Plant Ecology, 172, pp. 237-249, (2004); Koop A.L., Horvitz C.C., Projection matrix analysis of the demography of an invasive, nonnative shrub (Ardisia elliptica, Ecology, 86, pp. 2661-2672, (2005); Manly B.F.J., Randomization and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology., (1991); Morris W.F., Doak D.F., Quantitative Conservation Biology: Theory and Practice of Population Viability Analysis., (2002); Pascarella J.B., Horvitz C.C., Hurricane disturbance and the population dynamics of a tropical understory shrub: Megamatrix elasticity analysis, Ecology (Washington DC), 79, pp. 547-563, (1998); Peres-Neto P.R., Olden J.D., Assessing the robustness of randomization tests: Examples from behavioural studies, Animal Behavior, 61, pp. 71-86, (2001); Schoen R., Kim Y.J., Movement toward stability as a fundamental principle of population-dynamics, Demography, 28, pp. 455-466, (1991); Tuljapurkar S.D., Population dynamics in variable environments 3.

We argue that stochastic projections should estimate and incorporate the uncertainty in the SER if they are to provide a good estimate of overall uncertainty.","Population forecasts; Population momentum; Reproductive value; Stable equivalent population; Stochastic demography","Mathematical models; Random processes; Population forecast; Population momentum; Reproductive value; Stable equivalent population; Stochastic demography; Population statistics","","","","","Morrison Institute for Population and Resources; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DEB 9420153); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (AG 11761); University of California Berkeley, UCB; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (32124, HD 16640)","S.T. thanks the Morrison Institute for Population and Resources, M.

Standard protocols (timing, percentage of children to be immunized) do not take into account the rapid rates of population growth in developing countries (3.0% per year on average in sub-Saharan Africa and 2.0% in the rest of Africa, in Latin America, and in Asia, excluding China). Most public health planning models in this area were created based on static infant populations. The World Health Organization advises vaccinating at least 85% of children aged 6 to 9 months, a 3-month immunization window during which maternal antibodies are low (so the vaccination takes) and herd immunity is high (the probability that a child will encounter the disease is low because most children have been immunized). In practice, the immunization window in developing countries is 1 year or more. More susceptible children are present than assumed by the models. A larger number of susceptible babies are added each year during rapid population growth. As the age range for immunization widens, a higher percentage of children must be vaccinated to eradicate disease (chart). The proportion of each birth cohort that must be immunized rises as the population growth rate increases. At zero population growth, 94% must be vaccinated; at population growth rates greater than 3%, 98% must be vaccinated.","","Child Welfare; Communicable Disease Control; Delivery of Health Care; Demography; Developing Countries; Health; Health Services; Immunization; Methods; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Primary Health Care; Vaccination; Child Health; Communicable Disease Control; Delivery Of Health Care; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Health; Health Services; Immunization; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Primary Health Care; Procedures; Vaccination; article; child health; child welfare; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; health; health care delivery; health service; immunization; infection control; population; population dynamics; population growth; primary health care; Procedures; technique; vaccination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","07492448","","","12319060","English","Popul Today","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029198219"

We show that the stochastic elasticity ES does not accurately describe the effect of variability; one should use ESσ and ESμ. We establish two general properties of these elasticities: a sum rule that connects them and a limit on the sum of the ESσ.

The ruggedness of the environment is measured by the extent of random variation in per-capita reproductive success. We show how variable diapause and environmental characteristics affect the population′s stochastic growth rate. In rugged unpredictable environments, phenotypes that show some tendency to diapause are found to have a higher growth rate than nondiapausing phenotypes. In harsh rugged environments, some tendency to diapause may be all that permits population persistence. Positive serial autocorrelation causes the optimal diapause fraction to decrease, while negative autocorrelation causes that fraction to increase. The structured model behaves very differently from a scalar model for large diapause fractions even in uncorrelated environments, and in many cases predicts a broad optimum. The difference between models is due to the extreme variability of stage structure in populations subject to even small variability when diapause tendency is high. © 1993 Academic Press.","","Animal; Ecology; Environment; Female; Hibernation; Insects; Models, Genetic; Periodicity; Phenotype; Polymorphism (Genetics); Population Growth; Random Allocation; Reproduction; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Survival Rate; Time Factors; diapause; uncertainty; animal; article; biological model; ecology; environment; female; genetic polymorphism; genetics; growth, development and aging; hibernation; insect; metabolism; periodicity; phenotype; physiology; population growth; randomization; reproduction; survival rate; time","","","","","","","Bender C.M., Orzag S.A., Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers, (1978); Brown J.S., Venable D.L., Evolutionary ecology of seed-bank annuals in temporally varying environments, Am.

We develop the concept of habitat-stage elasticity, EβS, which gives the proportional sensitivity of the stochastic growth rate to perturbations of stage transition rates in each state (β) of the habitat. We employ it to understand why a specialist gall-making seed predator has relatively low impact on the fitness of a subtropical shrub. The plant lives in a forest characterized by patchy, recurrent disturbances caused by hurricanes. Both predation rate and plant demography vary with canopy openness. In the most closed-canopy state, the seed predator destroys 90% of the fruits, and demographic quality, the dominant eigenvalue of that state's matrix, is low, while in the most open-canopy state, predation is negligible and demographic quality high. The seed predator is locally extirpated by strong hurricanes, recolonization taking several years. The effect of the predator on the stochastic growth rate is negligible at both low and high hurricane frequency. Its effect peaks (6%) at an intermediate hurricane frequency. The stochastic growth rate varies in its sensitivity to the predator in different states of the habitat due to a product of two factors: the frequency of the state in the environment and the contribution of fecundity to its elasticity. The latter factor encapsulates the expected sequence of future states of the habitat. In our system, the contribution of fecundity to elasticity of the darkest state increases with hurricane frequency, even though the probability of encountering that state decreases, because today's dark habitats are more likely to become lighter ones. The contribution of fecundity to the two lightest states does not vary with hurricane frequency. In contrast, its contribution in intermediate states at intermediate hurricane frequencies is most dynamic, since uncolonized states may become colonized states and insensitive states may become sensitive states. The effects of an animal on plant fitness is determined by the disturbance regime in addition to its impact on vital rates in each environmental state. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Ardisia; Effects of animals on plant fitness; Environment-specific elasticity; Gall-making moths; Habitat elasticity; Periploca; Stochastic growth rate; Stochastic sequence","Animalia; Ardisia; Lepidoptera; Periploca; community dynamics; environmental disturbance; fitness; gall insect; growth rate; hurricane; seed predation","","","","","","","Bastrante B., Lebreton J.D., Thompson J.D., Predicting demographic change in response to herbivory: A model of the effects of grazing and annual variation on the population dynamics of Anthyllis vulneraria, Journal of Ecology, 83, pp. 603-611, (1995); Caswell H., Matrix Population Models: Construction, Analysis and Interpretation.

Anthropogenic changes may amplify or impede these patterns of variation, and may have positive or negative effects on population growth. Using stochastic population projection matrix models, we develop stochastic elasticities (proportional derivatives of the long-run population growth rate) to gauge the population effects of three types of change in demographic variability (changes in within- and between-disturbance-phase variability and phase-specific changes). Computing these elasticities for five species of disturbance- influenced perennial plants, we pinpoint demographic rates that may reveal adaptation to disturbance, and we demonstrate that species may differ in their responses to different types of changes in demographic variability driven by climate change. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Climate change; Demographic variability; Disturbance; Elasticity; Fire; Life-history adaptation; Long-run stochastic growth rate; Markov transition matrix; Population projection matrix","Adaptation, Biological; Climate; Ecology; Ecosystem; Humans; Models, Statistical; Plants; Population Growth; Stochastic Processes; adaptation; climate change; demographic trend; environmental disturbance; growth rate; life history; perennial plant; survival; adaptation; article; climate; ecology; ecosystem; human; plant; population growth; statistical model; statistics","","","","","","","Boer G.J., Flato G., Ramsden D., A transient climate change simulation with greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing: Projected climate to the twenty-first century, Clim.

An age-structured model of childhood disease epidemiology for nonstationary populations is formulated which incorporates explicit scaling assumptions with respect both to time and to population density. The static equilibrium properties and the dynamic local stability of the model are analyzed, as are the effects of random variability due to fluctuations in demographic structure. We determine the consequences of population growth rate for: the critical level of immunization needed to eradicate an endemic disease, the transient epidemic period, the return time which measures the stability of departures from epidemiological equilibrium, and the power spectrum of epidemiological fluctuations and combined demographic-epidemiological fluctuations. Growing populations are found to be significantly different from stationary ones in each of these characteristics. The policy implications of these findings are discussed. © 1991.","","Age Factors; Child; Demography; Developing Countries; Disease Transmission; Epidemiology; Evolution; Human; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Population Growth; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; age; article; biological model; child; demography; developing country; disease transmission; epidemiology; evolution; human; mathematics; population growth","","","","","James Trussell; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (HD16640, HDO0639); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (R29AI029418)","We thank M.

For a serially uncorrelated dichotomic vital rate the distribution of age structure is found analytically to be a singular steplike function; outside a specific region of vital rate values the singular function crosses a threshold to a smooth function. For a vital rate following a correlated two state Markov process the joint distributions of age structure and environment are found analytically to be singular steplike functions; again a threshold marks a transition to a smooth function. For fecundities which are serially uncorrelated but continuously distributed the age structure distribution is obtained as a smooth analytic function for all parameter values.

We examine differences in the age pattern of mortality in industrialized countries over time to show that inequality in adult life spans, which we measure with the standard deviation of life table ages at death above age 10 years, S 10, is increasingly responsible for the remaining divergence in mortality. We report striking differences in level and trend of S 10 across industrialized countries since 1960, which cannot be explained by aggregate socioeconomic inequality or differential external-cause mortality. Rather, S 10 reflects both within- and between-group inequalities in life spans and conveys new information about their combined magnitudes and trends. These findings suggest that the challenge for health policies in this century is to reduce inequality, not just lengthen life. © 2005 The Population Council, Inc.","","adult; life expectancy; mortality","","","","","","","Aalen O.O., Gjessing H.K., Understanding the shape of the hazard rate: A process point of view, Statistical Science, 16, 1, pp. 1-22, (2001); Adams P., Michael D., Hurd M.D., McFadden D., Merrill A., Riberio T., Healthy, wealthy, and wise?Tests for direct causal paths between health and socioeconomic status, Journal of Econometrics, 112, 1, pp. 3-56, (2003); (2004); Bourguignon F., Inequality among world citizens: 1820-1992, American Economic Review, 92, 4, pp. 727-744, (2002); Browning M., Crossley T.F., The life-cycle model of consumption and saving, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 15, 3, pp. 3-22, (2001); Burkhauser R.V., Cutts A.C., Daly M.C., Jenkins S.P., Testing the significance of income distribution changes over the 1980s business cycle: A crossnational comparison, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 14, 3, pp. 253-272, (1999); Cheung S.L.K., Robine J.-M., Tu E.J.-C., Caselli G., Three dimensions of the survival curve: Horizontalization, verticalization, and longevity extension, Demography, 42, 2, pp. 243-258, (2005); Deaton A., Commentary: The convoluted story of international studies of inequality and health, International Journal of Epidemiology, 31, pp. 546-549, (2002); Deaton A., Health, inequality, and economic development, Journal of Economic Literature, 49, 1, pp. 113-158, (2003); Deininger K., Squire L., A new data set measuring income inequality, World Bank Economic Review, 10, pp. 565-591, (1996); Dynan K.E., Skinner J., Zeldes S.P., The importance of bequests and life-cycle saving in capital accumulation: A new answer, American Economic Review, 92, 2, pp. 274-278, (2002); Elo I.T., New African American life tables from 1935-1940 to 1985-1990, Demography, 38, 1, pp. 97-114, (2001); Gakidou E.E., Murray C.J.L., Frenk J., Defining and measuring health inequality: An approach based on the distribution of health expectancy, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 78, 1, pp. 42-54, (2000); Gjonca A., Tomassini C., Vaupel J.W., Male-female differences in mortality in the developed world, MIPDR Working Paper 1999-009, (1999); Goldman N., Takahashi S., Old-age mortality in Japan: Demographic and epidemiological perspectives, Health and Mortality Among Elderly Populations, pp. 157-181, (1996); Gravelle H., Wildman J., Sutton M., Income, income inequality and health: What can we learn from aggregate data?, Social Science & Medicine, 54, pp. 577-589, (2002); Hales S., Howden-Chapman P., Salmond C., Woodward A., Mackenbach J., National infant mortality rates in relationship to gross national product and distribution of income, The Lancet, 354, 9195, (1999); (2004); Hurd M.D., McGarry K., Evaluation of the subjective probabilities of survival in the Health and Retirement Study, Journal of Human Resources, 30, SUPPL., (1995); Hurd M.D., The predictive validity of subjective probabilities of survival, The Economic Journal, 112, 482, pp. 966-985, (2002); Kalemli-Ozcan S., Does mortality decline promote economic growth?, Journal of Economic Growth, 7, 4, pp. 411-439, (2002); Kalemli-Ozcan S., Weil D.N., Mortality change, the uncertainty effect, and retirement, NBER Working Paper 8742, (2002); Kannisto V., Measuring the compression of mortality, Demographic Research, 3, 6, (2000); Kitagawa E.M., Hauser P.M., Differential Mortality in the United States: A Study in Socioeconomic Epidemiology, (1973); Kullback S., Leibler R.A., On information and sufficiency, The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 22, 1, pp. 79-86, (1951); Lindert P.H., Three centuries of inequality in Britain and America, Handbook of Income Distribution, 1, pp. 167-216, (2000); Harmonization of original series conducted by the Luxembourg Income Study, (2003); Lynch J., Et al., Income inequality, the psychosocial environment, and health: Comparisons of wealthy nations, The Lancet, 358, pp. 194-200, (2001); Lynch J., Et al., Is income inequality a determinant of population health?Part 1.

It is shown analytically that the distribution of total population number is lognormal at long times. Measures of population growth are compared and it is shown that a mean logarithmic growth rate and a logarithmic variance effectively describe growth and extinction at long times. Numerical simulations are used to explore the convergence to lognormality and the effects of environmental variance and autocorrelation. The results given apply to other geometric growth models which involve nonnegative growth matrices. © 1980.","","","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (EY-76-F-02-2472)","We thank Becky Jones for a splendid typing job, Fred Cohan for supplying us with an ingenious computer algorithm, Martin Kreitman for long and lively discussions, and both Joel Cohen and R.

Analysis of the stochastic growth rate indicates that the optimal clutch size in a variable environment can be substantially increased or decreased relative to the optimal clutch size in a constant environment. This finding holds regardless of whether the cost of reproduction varies discretely or continuously. Our results also illustrate how two distinct optimal life histories can evolve in response to a given amount of environmental variability. One life history pays a cost of reproduction that is relatively fixed and small on average (by producing a small fixed clutch size); it can always produce an optimal clutch size but is unable to exploit highly favorable environments. The other pays a cost of reproduction that is variable and large on average (by producing a large fixed clutch size); it cannot always produce an optimal clutch size but is able to exploit highly favorable environments.","Bet-hedging; Bird; Clutch size; Demography; Ecology; Environmental variability; Evolution; Life history; Optimality; Reproductive effort; Stochastic growth rate","Aves; Vertebrata; bet-hedging; clutch size; environmental factor; evolution; life history; reproductive effort","","","","","","","Benton T.G., Grant A., Optimal reproductive effort in stochastic, density-dependent environments, Evolution, 53, pp. 677-688, (1999); Benton T.G., Grant A., Clutton-Brock T.H., Does environmental stochasticity matter?

Interannual variances in vital rates certainly do, but it has been suggested that between-year correlations may not. We present an analytical approximation to stochastic growth rate for multistate Markovian environments and show that it is accurate by testing it in two empirically based examples. We find that temporal autocorrelation has sizeable effect on growth rates of structured populations, larger in many cases than the effect of interannual variability. Our approximation defines a sensitivity to autocorrelated variability, showing how demographic damping and environmental pattern interact to determine a population's stochastic growth rate. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Environmental autocorrelation; Markov chain; Random environments; Small-noise approximation; Stochastic growth rate","annual variation; autocorrelation; growth rate; population growth","","","","","","","Alvarez-Buylla E.R., Garcia-Barrios R., Seed and forest dynamics: A theoretical framework and an example from the neotropics, Am.

Stochastic variation in structured population models influences estimates of population growth rate, persistence and resilience, which ultimately can alter community composition, species interactions, distributions and harvesting. Here, we discuss how understanding these demographic consequences of environmental variation will have applications for anticipating changes in populations resulting from anthropogenic activities that affect the variance in vital rates. We also highlight new tools for anticipating the consequences of the magnitude and temporal patterning of environmental variability. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This approach accounts for 1) age structure, 2) density-independent fluctuations in vital rates, 3) life histories of arbitrary length, 4) variance and covariance of vital rates, and 5) an incorporation of genotypic differences in life history. Results indicate that there is no general advantage to a more iteroparous life history in a variable environment and that the direction of evolution depends on the absolute amount of environmental variation and the correlation structure of the vital rates. Analysis of ""indifference' curves also indicates that there is considerable potential for neutral evolution with respect to life history, given genotypic differences in environmental sensitivity. Nonexclusive partial answers to Cole's paradox are 1) that the magnitude of environmental variability and the correlation structure of vital rates cause short-lived, early-reproducting semelparous life histories to be disadvantageous within populations; and 2) if stochastic growth rates are nonnegative, such life histories have higher extinction rates when their stochastic growth rates equal those of more-iteroparous life histories, given that all the life histories share a constraint on the average life history. -from Authors","","demography; evolution; iteroparity; population dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00030147","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024915532"

We point out that one can always disaggregate after the forecast, rather than as part of the forecast Some of the issues raised could be illuminated by comparative empirical work, and there is room for valuable research of this sort Nonetheless, on the assumption that most people will continue to use cohort component type procedures, we have described a method for reducing the dimensionality of the forecasting problem by parsimoniously modeling the evolution over time of the age schedules of vital rates. This method steers a middle course between forecasting aggregates and forecasting individual age specific rates: we reduce the problem to forecasting a single parameter for fertility and another one for mortality. We have described a number of refinements and extensions of those basic methods, which preserve their underlying structure and simplicity. In particular, we show how one can fit the model more simply, incorporate lower bounds to the forecasts of rates, disaggregate by sex or race, and prepare integrated forecasts of rates for a collection of regions. We also discuss alternate approaches to forecasting the estimated indices of fertility and mortality, including state-space methods. These many versions of the basic method have yielded remarkably similar results. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

But we remain uncertain about the forces that reduce mortality, and about the cost implications of ageing populations and their associated social burden. The poor understanding of the factors driving mortality decline, and the difficulty of forecasting mortality are due in part to the pronounced irregularity of annual to decadal mortality change. Here we examine mortality over five decades in the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, US). In every country over this period, mortality at each age has declined exponentially at a roughly constant rate. This trend places a constraint on any theory of society-driven mortality decline, and provides a basis for stochastic mortality forecasting. We find that median forecasts of life expectancy are substantially larger than in existing official forecasts. In terms of the costs of ageing, we forecast values of the dependency ratio (that is, the ratio of people over 65 to working people) in 2050 that are between 6% (UK) and 40% (Japan) higher than official forecasts.","","Aging; Canada; France; Germany; Great Britain; Humans; Italy; Japan; Life Expectancy; Mortality; United States; aging population; demographic trend; longevity; mortality; aging; article; Canada; cost; dependent personality disorder; developed country; forecasting; France; Germany; human; Italy; Japan; life expectancy; mortality; priority journal; United States","","","","","","","Smith D.W., Human Longevity, (1993); Preston S.H., Forecasting the Health of Elderly Populations, pp. 51-77, (1991); Preston S.H., Mortality Patterns in National Populations, with Special Reference to Recorded cause of Death, (1976); Lee R.D., Demography of Aging, pp. 8-49, (1994); World Bank Policy Research Report Averting the Old Age Crisis: Policies to Protect the Old and Promote Growth, (1994); McKeown T., The Modern Rise of Population, (1976); Tuljapurkar S., Boe C., Mortality change and forecasting: How much and how little do we know?, N.

We find that developmental delay and reproductive delay are symmetric with respect to fitness i.e. they have the same effect on growth rate if they have equal costs, and if the environmental pattern is time-reversible. We describe this property by saying that if one kind of delay is an 'escape into the future', the other is an 'escape into the past'. When the costs of the two kinds of delay are equal, and we add a little delay to a life cycle that has none, the increase in growth rate is equal whether we add developmental delay, reproductive delay, or a combination of the two. When the costs of delay are equal, and we consider a life cycle that has just one form of delay, the largest gain in fitness tends to come from an increase in the delay that is already present. Thus, changes in the amount of delay tend to be self-reinforcing. Hence we expect evolution to lead to an entrainment so that life cycles will often contain mainly one or other kind of delay. As the amount of delay increases, the growth rate reaches a maximum that may be regarded as an ESS, and then falls. Geometrically, this maximum is a 'ridge' on the fitness surface when environments are moderately variable i.e. there are many combinations of delays that yield the maximum growth rate. When the environment becomes highly variable, or strongly positively autocorrelated, this 'ridge' is replaced by a pair of 'peaks'. Two combinations of delay then lead to the highest growth rate, one where reproductive delay is dominant and one where developmental delay is dominant.

First, on a theoretical level, mortality decline adds person years of life which are distributed across the life cycle. The interaction of this distribution with the age distribution of labor earnings minus consumption, or of taxes minus benefits, partially determines the corresponding steady state financial consequences of mortality decline. The effect of mortality decline on population growth rates also matters, but is negligible in low mortality populations. Second, examination of past mortality trends in the United States and of international trends in low mortality populations, suggests that mortality will decline faster than foreseen by the Social Security Administration's forecasts. Third, we combine the work of the first two parts in dynamic simulations to examine the implications of mortality decline and of alternative forecasts of mortality for the finances of the social security system. Also, we use stochastic population forecasts to assess the influence of uncertainty about mortality decline on uncertainty about finances; we find that uncertainty about fertility still has more important implications than uncertainty about mortality, contrary to sensitivity tests in the official forecasts.","","Actuarial Analysis;

Here we consider how it can be used when there are few observations at uneven intervals. Assuming that the underlying model is correct and that the mortality index follows a random walk with drift, we find the method can be used with sparse data. The central forecast depends mainly on the first and last observation, and so can be generated with just two observations, preferably not too close in time. With three data points, uncertainty can also be estimated, although such estimates of uncertainty are themselves highly uncertain and improve with additional observations. We apply the methods to China and South Korea, which have 3 and 20 data points, respectively, at uneven intervals.","Lee-Carter method; Limited data; Mortality forecast","","","","","","","","Agresti A., Finlay B., Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences, (1997); Bell W.R., Comparing and assessing time series methods for forecasting age specific demographic rates, Journal of Official Statistics, 13, pp. 279-303, (1997); Coale A., Guo G., Revised regional model life tables at very low levels of mortality, Population Index, 55, pp. 613-643, (1989); Fox J., Applied Regression Analysis, Linear Models, and Related Methods, (1997); Hamilton J.D., Time Series Analysis, (1994); Keilman N., Ex-post errors in official population forecasts in industrialized countries, Journal of Official Statistics, 13, 3, pp. 245-277, (1997); Keilman N., How accurate are the united nations world population projections?, Population and Development Review, 24, pp. 15-41, (1998); (2002); Lee R., Mortality Forecasts and Linear Life Expectancy Trends, (2002); Lee R., Rofman R., Modelacion y Proyeccion de la Mortalidad en Chile, NOTAS de Poblacion, 22, 59 JUNIO, pp. 183-213, (1994); Lee R.D., Carter L., Modeling and forecasting the time series of U.S. Mortality, J.

We investigate how temporal and spatial climatic fluctuations shape variation in agricultural production across dryland landscapes. We use a model that couples plant growth, climate, and soil organic matter dynamics, together with data from Kohala, Hawai'i, to understand how temperature, rainfall, nitrogen availability, and cropping activity interact to determine yield dynamics through time and space. Due to these interactions, the statistical characterization of rainfall alone is a poor characterization of agricultural yield. Using a simple linear model of human population dynamics, we show that the observed yield variation can affect long-term population growth substantially. Our approach to analyzing spatial and temporal fluctuations in food supply, and to interpreting the population consequences of these fluctuations, provides a quantitative evaluation of agricultural risk and human carrying capacity in dry regions. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Agroecosystem dynamics; Dryland agriculture; Hawai'i; Polynesia; Spatiotemporal variation; Stochastic demography","Hawaii [United States]; North America; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Polynesia; United States; agricultural development; agricultural ecosystem; anthropogenic effect; climate effect; crop yield; cropping practice; dryland farming; growth response; soil organic matter; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (BCS-0119819); National Science Foundation, NSF","Acknowledgments This research was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant BCS-0119819.

This paper makes a critical assessment of knowledge about mortality change. It is oriented toward the problem of forecasting the course of mortality change and the potential of existing work to contribute to the development of useful forecasts in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. We first examine broad patterns in the historical decline in death rates in the three countries, the effect of these on trends in life expectancy, and the epidemiological transition. Next we review theories of the age pattern and evolution of mortality, including graduations, evolutionary theory, reliability models, dynamic models, and relational models. The analysis and forecasting of mortality change have been shaped largely by some key historical lessons, which we summarize next. We emphasize issues that have been or are likely to be significant in mortality analysis, especially the questions of the age pattern and time trend in mortality at old ages; we distinguish patterns and facts that are established from those that remain uncertain. Next, we consider mortality differentials in characteristics such as sex, marital status, education, and socioeconomic variables; we summarize their key features and also point to the substantial gaps in our understanding of their determinants. Finally, we review methods of forecasting, including the scenario method used by the U.S. Social Security Administration and the time series method of Lee and Carter. We set out some important recommendations for forecasters: forecasting assumptions should be made more formal and explicit; there should be retrospective evaluations of forecast performance; and greater attention should be paid to the assessment and consequences of forecast uncertainty. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Alho J.M., Stochastic Methods in Population Forecastinǵ, International Journal of Forecastinǵ, 6, pp. 521-530, (1990);

These models provide a comprehensive description of patterns of temporal variation. Our formulas describe the effects of cohort (birth) environmental condition on mortality at all ages, and of the effects on survivorship of environmental variability experienced over the course of life.

Using the single-locus invasion condition for a novel allele in a variable environment, we derive conditions where increased migration rates between two sites are favored. We find that while there is a strong advantage to migrants entering a resident population with no migration, there is little advantage to migrants entering a population where the residents migrate at a different rate. Instead of an optimal rate of migration, there is a range of favored migration rates. Negative spatial correlation and a population structure including more than two sites accentuate the advantage of migration. Extending this model to include the effects of developmental delay (e.g. seed dormancy or diapause) on the evolution of migration, we find that higher levels of such delay reduce the advantage to migrants. © 1994 Academic Press Limited.","","diapause; life history; migration; population model; seed dormancy","","","","","","","Charlesworth B., Evolution in Age-Structured Populations, (1980); Cohen D., Optimizing reproduction in a randomly varying environment, J.

For an instantaneous drop to replacement fertility, Nathan Keyfitz found a simple expression M K for the momentum. However, as Keyfitz pointed out, `no one thinks that any country will drop immediately to stationary reproduction patterns'. We present results concerning the momentum of a population whose demographic transition is completed within a finite time. First, we provide an exact analytical formula for such a population's momentum. Second, for rapid fertility transitions, we obtain a simple exact expression for momentum that reduces to Keyfitz's M K if the transition is instantaneous. We show, by example, that our simpler formulae are accurate approximations to population momentum for transitions that take as long as 100 years. Finally, we show that the speed of fertility decline makes a substantial difference to population momentum. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","demographic transition; fertility; population dynamics","","","","","","","Cerone P., On the effects of the generalized renewal integral equation model of population dynamics, Genus, 52, pp. 53-70, (1996); Coale A., Demeny P., Regional Model Life Tables and Stable Population, (1983); Feller W., An Introduction to Probabiity Theory and Its Applications, 2, (1966); Keyfitz N., On the momentum of population growth, Demography, 8, pp. 71-80, (1971); Kim Y., Et al., Momentum and the growth-free segment of a population, Demography, 28, pp. 159-172, (1991); Li N., Tuljapurkar S., The solution of time-dependent population model, (1997); Lee R., Modeling and forecasting the time series of U.S. fertility: Age distribution, range and ultimate level, International Journal of Forecasting, 9, pp. 187-202, (1993); Mitra S., Models of birth trajectories with certain patterns of variation in vital rates, Genus, 43, pp. 1-14, (1987); Mitra S., Influence of instantaneous fertility decline to replacement level on population growth: An alternative model, Demography, 13, pp. 513-519, (1976); Pollard J., Mathematical Models of the Growth of Human Population, (1973); Preston S., The relation between actual and intrinsic growth rates, Population Studies, 40, 3, pp. 343-351, (1986)","","","","","","","","","00324728","","","","English","Popul.

The rate of natural increase - hereafter called the annual growth rate - likely averaged 0.1% during this period. A closed population growing at this rate would have experienced only a 2.7-fold increase, so that the deficit must have been balanced by immigration, and the question is how much? Hanihara (1987), who assumed constant growth and immigration rates, arrived at an estimate of over 3,000 immigrants per year - an ""unacceptably"" high level of immigration. In this paper, we modify Hanihara's original model to permit the annual growth rate to vary around the long term average of 0.1%. Specifically, we model model the annual growth rate as an autoregressive time-series with normally distributed random shocks. When the autoregressive coefficient, b, and the standard deviation of the random shocks, h, are large, the requisite level of immigration may be substantially reduced. In particular, with b = 0.9 and h = 0.1, 50 immigrants per year may suffice. Time-series data on crude birth and death rates are available from historical-demographic studies. Unfortunately, the parameters b and h estimated from these data may not be large enough for the predicted reductions to occur.","Autoregressive time-series; Growth rate; Immigration","","","","","","","","Ammerman A.J., Cavalli-Sforza L.L., The Neolithic Transition and the Genetics of Populations in Europe, (1984); Aoki K., Shida M., Shigesada N., Travelling wave solutions for the spread of farmers into a region occupied by hunter-gatherers, Theoretical Population Biology, 50, pp. 1-17, (1996); Birdsell J.B., Some population problems involving Pleistocene man, Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology, 22, pp. 47-69, (1957); Carneiro R.L., Hilse D., On determining the probable rate of population growth during the Neolithic, American Anthropologist, 68, pp. 179-181, (1966); Davis K., The Population of India and Pakistan, (1951); Hanihara K., Estimation of the number of early migrants in Japan: A simulative study, Journal of the Anthropological Society of Nippon, 95, pp. 391-403, (1987); Hanihara K., Dual structure model for the population history of the Japanese, Japan Review, 2, pp. 1-33, (1991); Hassan F.A., On mechanisms of population growth during the Neolithic, Current Anthropology, 14, pp. 535-542, (1973); Keilman N., Pham D.Q., Predictive intervals for age-specific fertility, European Journal of Population, 16, pp. 41-66, (2000); Koyama S., Jomon subsistence and population, Senri Ethnological Studies, 2, pp. 1-65, (1978); Koyama S., Jomon Age, (1984); Lee R.D., Population dynamics of humans and other animals, Demography, 24, pp. 443-465, (1987); Lee R.D., Modeling and forecasting the time series of U.S. Fertility: Age distribution, range and ultimate level, International Journal of Forecasting, 9, pp. 187-202, (1993); Lewontin R.C., Cohen D., On population growth in a randomly varying environment, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A., 62, pp. 1056-1060, (1969); McEvedy C., Jones R., Atlas of World Population History, (1978); Nakahashi T., Population explosion as inferred from the number of graves, Proto-Japanese, pp. 30-46, (1993); Tsuya N.O., Kurosu S., Patterns and covariates of fertility in 18th and 19th century rural Japan: Evidence from two northeastern villages, EurAsia Project on Population and Family History, 16, (1997); Tsuya N.O., Kurosu S., Mortality responses to short-term economic stress and household context in eighteenth and nineteenth century rural Japan, Population and Economy: From Hunger to Modern Economic Growth, (2000); Tuljapurkar S.D., Boe C., Validation, Bayesian methods, and information in stochastic forecasts, International Journal of Forecasting, 15, pp. 259-271, (1999); Tuljapurkar S.D., Lee R.D., Demographic uncertainty and the stable equivalent population, Mathematical Computer Modelling, 26, pp. 39-56, (1997); Yamaguchi B., A review of the osteological characteristics of the Jomon population in prehistoric Japan, Journal of the Anthropological Society of Nippon, 90, SUPPL., pp. 77-90, (1982); Yamaguchi B., Metric study of the crania from protohistoric sites in Eastern Japan, Bulletin of the National Science Museum, Series D, 13, pp. 1-9, (1987); Yoshizaki M., Emergence of cultivated plants in Japan, Archaeology Quarterly, 50, pp. 18-24, (1995)","","","Anthropological Society of Nippon","","","","","","09187960","","","","English","Anthropol.

We begin with Lee's ARMA model which leads to prediction intervals that are more realistic and informative than point-wise forecasts or traditional scenario methods. The roles of historical information and expert judgment are analyzed in terms of their effects upon prediction uncertainty. Validation experiments suggest that the model performs well in characterizing the uncertainty of the US fertility experience. We argue that the long-run average of fertility, a key assumption of the model, operates on a time scale not probed by time-series methods and we use Bayesian priors to quantify the additional prediction uncertainty that comes from making the long-run fertility assumption.","ARMA Models; Fertility; Mortality; Population projection; Stochastic forecasts; United States; Validation","","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (HD 16640, HD 32124)","We are grateful for support from NICHD grants HD 16640 and HD 32124.

The general solution to the renewal equation in such cases is obtained. This solution describes the birth sequence explicitly, and also leads to a general formula for population momentum. We show that the duration of the transition determines the complexity of the solution for the birth sequence. For transitions that are completed in a time smaller than the maximum age of reproduction, we show that the classical Lotka solution found in every textbook also applies, with a small modification, to the time-dependent case.

This article presents and implements a new method for making stochastic population forecasts that provide consistent probability intervals. We blend mathematical demography and statistical time series methods to estimate stochastic models of fertility and mortality based on U.S. data back to 1900 and then use the theory of random-matrix products to forecast various demographic measures and their associated probability intervals to the year 2065. Our expected total population sizes agree quite closely with the Census medium projections, and our 95 percent probability intervals are close to the Census high and low scenarios. But Census intervals in 2065 for ages 65+ are nearly three times as broad as ours, and for 85+ are nearly twice as broad. In contrast, our intervals for the total dependency and youth dependency ratios are more than twice as broad as theirs, and our ratio for the elderly dependency ratio is 12 times as great as theirs. These items have major implications for policy, and these contrasting indications of uncertainty clearly show the limitations of the conventional scenario-based methods. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Demographic forecasting; Population projection; Stochastic demography","","","","","","Morrison Institute; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (HD 16640, HD 24982)","* Ronald D.

The principal features of population behavior are found to be contained in an explicitly calculable response function. Three distinct regimes of qualitative behavior are described when cycle period is respectively much less than, of the order of, and much greater than the average generation length. These results make explicit the way in which transient properties corresponding to average vital rates determine population response to cycles. © 1985.","","Animal; Biometry; Environment; Human; Models, Biological; Periodicity; Population Dynamics; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; animal; article; biological model; biometry; environment; human; periodicity; population dynamics","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD016640)","","Coale, The Growth and Structure of Human Populations: A Mathematical Investigation, (1972); Gourley, Lawrence, Stable population analysis in periodic environments, Theor.

For a Markovian environment, we compare and contrast the meanings of the stochastic growth rate (λ 5), the growth rate of average population (λM), the growth rate for average transition rates (λA), and the growth rate of an aggregate represented by a megamatrix (shown here to equal λ M). We distinguish these growth rates by the averages that define them. We illustrate our results using data on an understory shrub in a hurricane-disturbed landscape, employing a range of hurricane frequencies. We demonstrate important differences among growth rates: λS < λM, but λA can be < or > λ M. We show that stochastic elasticity, EijS, and megamatrix elasticity, EijM, describe a complex perturbation of both means and variances of rates by the same proportion. Megamatrix elasticities respond slightly and stochastic elasticities respond strongly to changing the frequency of disturbance in the habitat (in our example, the frequency of hurricanes). The elasticity Eij A of λA does not predict changes in the other elasticities. Because ES, although commonly utilized, is difficult to interpret, we introduce elasticities with a more direct interpretation: ESμ for perturbations of means and ESσ for variances. We argue that a fundamental tool for studying selection pressures in varying environments is the response of growth rate to vital rates in all habitat states.","Ardisia escallonioides; Canopy-gap forest dynamics; Elasticity; Hurricanes; Norm of response; Plant population biology; Sensitivity; Stochastic demography; Temporal variation in demography","Ardisia; Environment; Models, Biological; Natural Disasters; Population Dynamics; Stochastic Processes; Time Factors; Trees; Ardisia; disturbance; elasticity; growth rate; population dynamics; population growth; stochasticity; Ardisia; article; biological model; disaster; environment; physiology; population dynamics; statistics; time; tree","","","","","","","Alvarez-Buylla E.R., Density dependence and patch dynamics in tropical rain forests: Matrix models and applications to a tree species, American Naturalist, 143, pp. 155-191, (1994); Beissinger S.R., Westphal M.I., On the use of demographic models of population viability in endangered species management, Journal of Wildlife Management, 62, pp. 821-841, (1998); Benton T.Q., Grant A., How to keep fit in the real world: Elasticity analyses and selection pressures on life histories in a variable environments, American Naturalist, 147, pp. 115-139, (1996); Elasticity analysis as an important tool in evolutionary and population ecology, Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 14, pp. 467-471, (1999); Benton T.Q., Grant A., Clutton-Brock T.H., Does environmental stochasticity matter?

One approach (that we call LT) uses historical data to estimate stochastic models (e.g., a time series model) of vital rates, and then makes forecasts. Another (we call it RS) began as a kind of randomized scenario: we consider its simplest variant, in which expert opinion is used to make probability distributions for terminal vital rates, and smooth trajectories are followed over time. We use analysis and examples to show several key differences between these methods: serial correlations in the forecast are much smaller in LT; the variance in LT models of vital rates (especially fertility) is much higher than in RS models that are based on official expert scenarios; trajectories in LT are much more irregular than in RS; probability intervals in LT tend to widen faster over forecast time. Newer versions of RS have been developed that reduce or eliminate some of these differences.","Dependency ratio; Population forecast; Probabilistic forecast; Random scenario; Scenario; Trajectory; Vital rates","","","","","","","","Alho J.M., Stochastic methods in population forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting, 6, pp. 521-530, (1990); Alho J.M., Spencer B.D., Uncertain population forecasting, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 80, 390, pp. 306-314, (1985); Anderson M., Tuljapurkar S., Lee R., Chances are ...

Convergence to demographic equilibrium can be studied in terms of convergence in the Markov chain. Tuljapurkar (1982) showed that population entropy (Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy) provides information on the rate of this convergence. This paper begins by considering finite state Markov chains, providing elementary proofs of the relationship between convergence rate and entropy, and discusses in detail the uses and limitations of entropy as a convergence measure; these results also apply to Markovian dynamical systems. Next, new qualitative and quantitative arguments are used to discuss the demographic meaning of entropy. An exact relationship is established giving population entropy in terms of the eigenvalues of the Leslie matrix characteristic equation. Finally, the significance of imprimitive and periodic limits is discussed in relation to population entropy. © 1993, Springer-Verlag.

Even when all heterozygotes are more fit than all homozygotes, the proportion of fitness arrays that will lead to a stable, feasible equilibrium of more than 6 or 7 alleles is vanishingly small. More alleles can be maintained if, in addition to heterosis, it is assumed that there is very little variation in fitness from heterozygote to heterozygote, with the ratio of mean heterosis to standard deviation of fitness among heterozygotes in the neighborhood of 10. When such conditions hold, the allelic frequency distribution and equilibrium will be very uniform, with all alleles very close to equal frequency p = 1/n. It is much more likely that stable equilibria for multiple alleles will be best explained by multiple niche selection.","","biological model; genetic polymorphism; heredity; heterosis; normal value","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00166731","","GENTA","","English","GENETICS","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0017887325"
