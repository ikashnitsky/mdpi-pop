Data and methods A geographic approach was used to decompose differences in life expectancy for residents of Inuit Nunangat, compared with people living outside this geographic area. Differences in life expectancy by cause, sex, and age group were calculated using the discrete method of decomposition and were applied to abridged life tables. Causes of death were classified according to Global Burden of Disease categories. Attributable causes of death were calculated for causes amenable to medical intervention and for smoking-related diseases. Results The largest contributor to life expectancy differences between males in Inuit Nunangat and the rest of Canada was injury, particularly selfinflicted injury at ages 15 to 24. For females, the largest contributors were malignant neoplasm and respiratory disease at ages 65 to 79. Interpretation The gap in life expectancy between residents of Inuit Nunangat and the rest of Canada can be attributed to specific groups of causes occurring within specific age ranges. © Minister of Industry, 2013.","Aboriginal; Cause of death; Death rate; Indigenous; Longevity; Mortality","Canada; Cause of Death; Humans; Inuits; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Canada; cause of death; human; Inuit; life expectancy; life table","","","","","","","Greenberg L., Normandin C., Disparities in life expectancy at birth, Health at a Glance, 19, (2012); Romanow R., Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada - Final Report, (2002); Bjerregaard P., Young T.K., Dewailly E., Ebbesson S.O.E., Indigenous health in the Arctic: an overview of the circumpolar Inuit population, Scandinavian Journal of Public Health, 32, 5, pp. 390-5, (2004); Carriere G., Tjepkema M., Pennock J., Goedhuis N., Cancer patterns in Inuit Nunangat, International Journal of Circumpolar Health, 71, (2012); Oliver L.N., Peters P.A., Kohen D.E., Mortality rates among children and youth aged 1 to 19 living in Inuit Nunangat 1994-2008, Health Reports, 23, 3, pp. 17-22, (2012); Penny C., Senecal S., Bobet E., Mortalité par suicide dans les collectives inuites au Canada: taux et effets des caractéristiques des collectivités, Cahiers québécois de démographie, 38, 2, pp. 311-43, (2009); Zhong-Cheng L., Senecal S., Simonet F., Et al., Birth outcomes in the Inuit-inhabited areas of Canada, Canadian Medical Association Journal, 182, 3, pp. 235-42, (2010); Peters P.A., Causes and contributions to differences in life expectancy for Inuit Nunangat and Canada 1994-2003., International Journal of Circumpolar Health, 69, pp. 66-77, (2010); Peters P.A., Shifting transitions: health inequalities in Inuit Nunangat in perspective, Journal of Rural and Community Development, 7, 1, pp. 36-58, (2012); Peters P.A., Oliver L.N., Carriere G.M., Geozones: an area-based method for analysis of health outcomes, Health Reports, 23, 1, pp. 55-64, (2012); Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Inuit of Canada, (2011); Wolfson M.C., On the uses of summary measures of population health.

This study describes a method for calculating hospitalization rates by the percentage of foreign-born in Census Dissemination Areas (DAs). Data and methods: Data from the 2006 Census were used to classify DAs by the percentage of the foreignborn population who lived in them. Quintile and tercile thresholds were created to classify DAs as having low to high percentages of foreign-born residents. This information was appended to the 2005/2006 Hospital Morbidity Database via postal codes. Age-sex standardized hospitalization rates were calculated for low to high foreign-born concentration DAs, nationally and subnationally. Results: Nationally, quintile thresholds had better discriminatory power to detect variations in hospitalization rates by foreign-born concentration, but tercile thresholds produced reliable results at subnational levels. All-cause hospitalization rates were lowest among residents of the high foreignborn concentration terciles. Similar gradients emerged in hospitalization rates for heart disease, diseases of the circulatory system, and mental health conditions. The pattern varied more at the subnational level.Interpretation: With this approach, administrative data can be used to calculate hospitalization rates by foreignborn concentration.","Administrative data; Ecological studies; Hospital records; Immigration; Public health surveillance","","","","","","","","Malenfant E.C., Lebel A., Martel L., Projections of the Diversity of the Canadian Population, 2006 to 2031, (2010); DesMeules M., Gold J., Kazanjian A., Et al., New approaches to immigrant health assessment, Canadian Journal of Public Health, 95, 3, (2004); Perez C.E., Health status and health behaviours among immigrants, Health Reports, 13, SUPPL, pp. 1-13, (2002); Newbold K.B., Self-rated health within the Canadian immigrant population, risk and the healthy immigrant effect, Social Science and Medicine, 60, 6, pp. 1359-1370, (2005); Hyman I., Immigration and Health, (2001); Ng E., Wilkins R., Gendron F., Dynamics of immigrants health in Canada, Evidence from the National Population Health Survey, Healthy Today, Healthy Tomorrow Findings from the National Population Health Survey, (2005); Ng E., The healthy immigrant effect and mortality rates, Health Reports, 22, 4, pp. 25-29, (2011); Creatore M.I., Moineddin R., Booth G., Et al., Age- and sex-related prevalence of diabetes mellitus among immigrants to Ontario, Canada, Canadian Medical Association Journal, 182, 8, pp. 781-789; Wilkins R., Tjepkema M., Mustard C., Choiniere R., The Canadian census mortality follow-up study, 1991 through 2001, Health Reports, 19, 3, pp. 25-43, (2008); Rotermann M., The impact of considering birthplace in analyses of immigrant health, Health Reports, 22, 4, pp. 37-43, (2011); Chiu M., Austin P.C., Manuel D.G., Tu J., Comparison of cardiovascular risk profiles among ethnic groups using population health surveys between 1996 and, Canadian Medical Association Journal, 182, 8, (2007); Berthelot J.M., Ross N.A., Tremblay S., Regional socio-economic context and health, Health Reports, 13, SUPPL, pp. 1-12, (2002); Wilkins R., Berthelot J.M., Ng E., Trends in mortality by neighbourhood income in urban Canada from 1971 to 1996, Health Reports, 13, SUPPL, pp. 1-27, (2002); Hou F., Chen J., Neighbourhood low income, income inequality and health in Toronto, Health Reports, 14, 2, pp. 21-34, (2003); Chui T., Tran K., Maheux H., Immigration in Canada, A Portrait of the Foreign-Born Population, Census, (2006); Davies W.K.D., Murdie R.A., Measuring the social ecology of cities, The Changing Social Geography of Canadian Cities, (1993); Hou F., Myles J., Neighbourhood inequality, relative deprivation and self-perceived health status, Analytical Studies Branch- Research Paper Series No. 228, (2004); Hou F., Recent immigration and the formation of visible minority neighbourhoods in Canadas largest cities.

These high-resource health system users are routinely characterized as older, with multiple comorbidities, and reduced access to adequate health care. Geographic trends also emerge, with more rural and isolated regions demonstrating higher rates of high-resource use than others. Despite known geographical discrepancies in health care access and outcomes, health policy and research initiatives remain focused on urban population centers. To alleviate mounting health system pressure from high-resource users, their characteristics must be better understood within the context in which i arises. To examine this, a scoping review was conducted to provide an overview of characteristics of high-resource users in rural and remote communities in Canada and Australia. In total, 21 papers were included in the review. Using qualitative thematic coding, primary findings characterized rural high-resource users as those of an older age; with increased comorbid conditions and condition severity; lower socioeconomic status; and elevated risk behaviors. © 2023 by the authors.","health care; health care costs; health services research; healthcare inequalities; public health systems research; rural health","Australia; Canada; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Rural Health Services; Rural Population; Urban Population; Australia; Canada; access restriction; health care; health geography; health risk; health services; medical geography; morbidity; public health; rural society; socioeconomic status; aged; Australia; Canada; health care access; health care cost; health care policy; human; public health systems research; review; risk behavior; rural health; social status; systematic review; urban population; health care delivery; rural health care; rural population","","","","","Ontario Ministry of Health (Canada), (ER18-14-064); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada) Connection, (611-2017-0548)","This research was funded by Ontario Ministry of Health (Canada), through an Ontario Early Researcher Award (ERA) number ER18-14-064, Patient Experiences of High Health System Users in Rural Canada; and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada) Connection Grant number 611-2017-0548, Free Range International Knowledge Exchange.","Figueroa J.F., Papanicolas I., Riley K., Abiona O., Arvin M., Atsma F., Bernal-Delgado E., Bowden N., Blankart C.R., Deeny S., Et al., International comparison of health spending and utilization among people with complex multimorbidity, Health Serv.

Over the last decade, several studies have reported associations between short-term (day-to-day) increases in ambient air pollution and stroke. The findings from a smaller number of studies that have looked at long-term exposure to air pollution and stroke have been mixed. Most of these epidemiological studies have assigned exposure to air pollution based on place of residence, but these assignments are typically based on relatively coarse spatial resolutions. To date, few studies have evaluated medium-term exposures (i.e, exposures over the past season or year). To address this research gap, we evaluated associations between highly spatially resolved estimates of ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO§ssub§2§esub§), a marker of traffic pollution, and emergency department visits for stroke in Edmonton, Canada. Methods. This was a case-control study with cases defined as those who presented to an Edmonton area hospital emergency department between 2007 and 2009 with an acute ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. Controls were patients who presented to the same emergency departments for lacerations, sprains, or strains. A land-use regression model provided estimates of NO§ssub§ 2§esub§ that were assigned to the place of residence. Logistic regression methods were used to estimate odds ratios for stroke in relation to an increase in the interquartile range of NO§ssub§2§esub§ (5 ppb), adjusted for age, sex, meteorological variables, and neighborhood effects. Results: The study included 4,696 stroke (cases) and 37,723 injury patients (controls). For all strokes combined, there was no association with NO§ssub§2.§esub§ Namely, the odds ratio associated with an interquartile increase in NO§ssub§2§esub§ was 1.01 (95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.94-1.08). No associations were evident for any of the stroke subtypes examined. Conclusion: When combined with our earlier work in Edmonton, our findings suggest that day-to-day fluctuations in air pollution increase the risk of ischemic stroke during the summer season, while medium term exposures are unrelated to stroke risk. The findings for medium term exposure should be interpreted cautiously due to limited individual-level risk factor data. © 2013 Johnson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Air pollution; Case-control study;

Unlike their self-build counterparts in Latin American cities which start as illegal occupations of totally un-serviced lots, in the USA housing production is largely self-managed (embracing trailer homes, manufactured homes, modular units with self-help home improvement, etc.), placed on legally developed lots, albeit poorly or minimally serviced. As researchers begin to understand the logic and rationale underpinning their existence, and better appreciate where (spatially), and what (physical) ""footprints"" to look for, it becomes possible to identify and quantify the full extent of these peri-urban settlement phenomena. This paper reports on a three Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the USA to demonstrate the methodology and argues that this has wider application both in the USA and elsewhere. Specifically for the US, the paper outlines some of the policy implications that arise from using integrated techniques to develop an inventory of IFHS and from a deepening of public recognition of the phenomenon. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote health technologies are often promoted as solutions to increase health system efficiency, to enhance quality of care, and to decrease gaps in access to care for rural and remote communities. However, there is mixed evidence for these interventions, particularly related to how they are received and perceived by health providers and by patients. Health technologies do not always adequately meet the needs of patients or providers. To examine this, a broad-based scoping review was conducted to provide an overview of patient and provider perspectives of eHealth initiatives in rural communities. The unique objective of this review was to prioritize the voices of patients and providers in discussing the disparities between health interventions and needs of people in rural communities. eHealth initiatives were reviewed for rural communities of Australia and Canada, two countries that have similar geographies and comparable health systems at the local level. Methods: Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with results limited from 2000 to 2018. Keywords included combinations of 'eHealth', 'telehealth', 'telemedicine', 'electronic health', and 'rural/remote'. Individual patient and provider perspectives on health care were identified, followed by qualitative thematic coding based on the type of intervention, the feedback provided, the affected population, geographic location, and category of individual providing their perspective. Quotes from patients and providers are used to illustrate the identified benefits and disadvantages of eHealth technologies. Results: Based on reviewed literature, 90.1% of articles reported that eHealth interventions were largely positive. Articles noted decreased travel time (18%), time/cost saving (15.1%), and increased access to services (13.9%) as primary benefits to eHealth. The most prevalent disadvantages of eHealth were technological issues (24.5%), lack of face-to-face contact (18.6%), limited training (10.8%), and resource disparities (10.8%). These results show where existing eHealth interventions could improve and can inform policymakers and providers in designing new interventions. Importantly, benefits to eHealth extend beyond geographic access. Patients reported ancillary benefits to eHealth that include reduced anxiety, disruption on family life, and improved recovery time. Providers reported closer connections to colleagues, improved support for complex care, and greater eLearning opportunity. Barriers to eHealth are recognized by patient and providers alike to be largely systemic, where lack of rural high-speed internet and unreliability of installed technologies were significant. Conclusion: Regional and national governments are seen as the key players in addressing these technical barriers. This scoping review diverges from many reviews of eHealth with the use of firstperson perspectives. It is hoped that this focus will highlight the importance of patient voices in evaluating important healthcare interventions such as eHealth and associated technologies. © James Cook University.","Australia; Canada; EHealth; Patient perspectives; Primary care; Telehealth","Australia; Canada; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Physician-Patient Relations; Primary Health Care; Referral and Consultation; Rural Population; Telemedicine; Australia; Canada; doctor patient relationship; health care delivery; human; organization and management; patient attitude; patient referral; primary health care; rural population; telemedicine","","","","","","","Liaw S.T., Humphreys J.S., Rural eHealth paradox: It's not just geography!, Australian Journal of Rural Health, 14, 3, pp. 95-98, (2006); Jong K.E., Smith D.P., Yu X.Q., O'Connell D.L., Goldstein D., Armstrong B.K., Remoteness of residence and survival from cancer in New South Wales, Medical Journal of Australia, 180, 12, pp. 618-622, (2004); Liaw S.T., Schattner P., Electronic decision support in general practice.

Because the Canadian Cancer Registry does not contain socioeconomic data, the 1991 Canadian Census Cohort was used to study social determinants of lung cancer risk in the general Canadian population. Data and methods: This study examines incidence rates of lung cancer and histologic subtypes by educational attainment, income and occupation in a broadly representative sample of Canadians aged 25 or older. Data for the 1991 Canadian Census Cohort were analyzed. The cohort comprised 2,734,835 individuals, among whom 215,700 new cancer cases were diagnosed from 1991 through 2003. Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated by age, sex, and SES using the direct method. Rate ratios, rate differences, and excess incidence were also calculated. Results: An inverse risk between lung cancer incidence and educational attainment, income and occupation emerged among men and women, and a stepped negative gradient in RRs was evident for all SES variables and age groups. If all cohort members had experienced the rate of those with a university degree, lung cancer incidence would have been 56% lower in men and 55% lower in women. If all cohort members had experienced the incidence rate of those in the highest income quintile, incidence would have been 33% lower in men and 25% lower in women. If all cohort members had experienced the rate of those in managerial occupations, incidence would have been 54% lower in men and 44% lower in women. Interpretation: A negative gradient in lung cancer risk was evident for all SES variables studied.","Age-standardized incidence rates; Longitudinal study; Lung cancer; Record linkage; Social determinants of health; Socioeconomic inequalities","Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Canada; Female; Humans; Incidence; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; adult; age distribution; aged; Canada; female; human; incidence; Lung Neoplasms; male; middle aged; pathology; prospective study; risk factor; sex ratio; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; very elderly","","","","","","","Canadian Cancer Statistics, 2014, (2014); Conway D., McKinney I., McMahon P., Et al., Socioeconomic factors associated with risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancer in Europe, European Journal of Cancer, 46, 3, pp. 588-598, (2010); Harper S., Lynch J., Meersman S.C., Et al., An overview of methods for monitoring social disparities in cancer with an example using trends in lung cancer incidence by area socioeconomic position and race-ethnicity, 1992-2004, American Journal of Epidemiology, 167, pp. 889-899, (2008); Sharpe K.H., McMahon A.D., McClements P., Et al., Socioeconomic inequalities in incidence of lung and upper aero-digestive tract cancer by age, tumour subtype and sex:A population-based study in Scotland, Cancer Epidemiology, 36, 3, pp. 164-170, (2012); van Loon A.J., Goldbohm R.A., van den Brandt P.A., Lung cancer: is there an association with socioeconomic status in The Netherlands?, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 49, 1, pp. 65-69, (1995); Hein H.O., Suadicani P., Gyntelberg F., Lung cancer risk and social class.

Traffic-related air pollution has also increasingly been identified as an important contributor to adverse health effects of air pollution. We employed a national nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure model to examine the association between NO2 and pregnancy outcomes in Canada between 1999 and 2008. National models for NO2 (and particulate matter of median aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) as a covariate) were developed using ground-based monitoring data, estimates from remote-sensing, land use variables and, for NO2, deterministic gradients relative to road traffic sources. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations with preterm birth, term low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA) and term birth weight, adjusting for covariates including infant sex, gestational age, maternal age and marital status, parity, urban/rural place of residence, maternal place of birth, season, year of birth and neighbourhood socioeconomic status and per cent visible minority. Associations were reduced considerably after adjustment for individual covariates and neighbourhood per cent visible minority, but remained significant for SGA (odds ratio 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06 per 20 ppb NO2) and term birth weight (16.2 g reduction, 95% CI 13.6-18.8 g per 20 ppb NO2). Associations with NO2 were of greater magnitude in a sensitivity analysis using monthly monitoring data, and among births to mothers born in Canada, and in neighbourhoods with higher incomes and a lower proportion of visible minorities. In two pollutant models, associations with NO2 were less sensitive to adjustment for PM2.5 than vice versa, and there was consistent evidence of a dose-response relationship for NO2 but not PM2.5. In this study of approximately 2.5 million Canadian births between 1999 and 2008, we found significant associations of NO2 with SGA and term birth weight which remained significant after adjustment for PM2.5, suggesting that traffic may be a particularly important source with respect to the role of air pollution as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2016.","Air pollution; Birth weight; Nitrogen dioxide; Preterm birth; Traffic","Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Canada; Female; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Male; Motor Vehicles; Nitrogen Dioxide; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Vehicle Emissions; Young Adult; Canada; nitrogen dioxide; air pollutant; exhaust gas; nitrogen dioxide; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; birth rate; dose-response relationship; health risk; nitrous oxide; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pregnancy; socioeconomic status; traffic emission; weight; adult; adverse outcome; Article; Canada; disease association; educational status; exhaust gas; female; gestational age; human; income; infant; land use; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; marriage; maternal age; maternal smoking; neighborhood; newborn; parity; particulate matter; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; priority journal; rural population; small for date infant; social status; urban population; adolescent; air pollutant; analysis; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; Premature Birth; young adult","","nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; Air Pollutants, ; Nitrogen Dioxide, ; Vehicle Emissions, ","","","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (R01ES019573); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS","","Aguilera I., Guxens M., Garcia-Esteban R., Corbella T., Nieuwenhuijsen M.J., Foradada C.M., Sunyer J., Association between GIS-based exposure to urban air pollution during pregnancy and birth weight in the INMA Sabadell Cohort, Environ.

Study design: The geographic area of coverage includes communities within Inuit Nunangat, with the addition of Inuvik in the Northwest Territories. Deaths were compiled for 2 5-year periods, 1994 through 1998 and 1999 through 2003, with the mid-year centred on the 1996 and 2001 censuses. Methods: Abridged life tables were constructed according to the revised Chiang method. Age decomposition of differences in life expectancy and cause-deleted life tables were calculated using a discrete approach. The age groups and causes contributing to differences in life expectancy between Inuit Nunangat and the rest of Canada were calculated. Results: Specific age groups contribute more to the difference in life expectancy between Inuit Nunangat and the rest of Canada. For males, over 50% of the difference in life expectancy is due to excess mortality before 25 years of age, while for females nearly 65% is due to excess mortality after the age of 60. Conclusions: Cancer is a major contributor to the difference in life expectancy between residents of Inuit Nunangat and the rest of Canada; reduction in cancer rates would make the greatest contribution to gains in life expectancy. There are clear gender differences in life expectancy and mortality, with the total effect of mortality being greatest for males between 15 and 25 years of age and for females over the age of 60.","Canada; Inuit; Inuit Nunangat; Life expectancy; Mortality","","","","","","","","Wilkins R., Uppal S., Fines P., Senecal S., Guimond E., Dion R., Life expectancy in the Inuit-inhabited areas of Canada, 1989-2003, Health Rep, 19, 1, pp. 7-30, (2008); MacMillan H.L., MacMillan A.B., Offor D.R., Dingle J.L., Aboriginal health, CMAJ, 155, 11, pp. 1569-1578, (1996); Bjerregaard P., Young T.K., Dewailly E., Ebbesson S.O.E., Indigenous health in the Arctic: An overview of the circumpolar Inuit population, Scand J Public Health, 32, 5, pp. 390-395, (2004); Macaulay A., Orr P., MacDonald S., Et al., Mortality in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut, 1987-1996, Int J Circumpolar Health, 63, SUPPL. 2, pp. 80-85, (2004); Kelly J., Lanier A., Et al., Cancer among the circumpolar Inuit, 1989-2003: II.

Food and housing are two critical social determinants of health contributing to health issues on many levels. The nutritional deficit associated with food insecurity and the transition away from traditional and towards market foods represents a dual risk with profound consequences. Knowledge of the physiological benefits associated with traditional food consumption is increasing, including for mental health and chronic disease. Ensuring the safety of traditional foods in terms of zoonotic diseases is thus highly valuable and efforts to institute adequate monitoring and address knowledge gaps are underway. Acute respiratory disease among the young remains a significant public health issue with potential long term effects. The human papilloma virus is manifesting itself among women across northern Canada with high risk types that are more similar to profiles observed in Europe than in North America with possible implications for immunization programs. Despite a high prevalence of Hepatitis B virus infections among residents of Inuit Nunangat, the outcomes appear to be relatively benign. Communication of new knowledge on the manifestation of this virus among northern populations is provided to health care providers in the North through modern technology. © 2012 The Author(s).","","Canada; Canadian Arctic; Hepatitis B virus; Human papillomavirus; Food supply; Public health; Canadian Arctic; Chronic disease; Food insecurity; Health care providers; Health issues; Health projects; Hepatitis B virus infection; Human papilloma virus; International polar year; Knowledge gaps; Long-term effects; Mental health; Modern technologies; Northern Canada; Population health; Public health issues; Risk types; Traditional food; Zoonotic disease; environmental monitoring; health risk; hepatitis; long-term change; mental health; public health; research work; respiratory disease; Viruses","","","","","","","Government of Canada Program for International Polar Year: Highlights and Achievements, (2011); Anctil M., Les faits saillants de l'enquête.

However, few studies have examined associations between community socioeconomic characteristics and mortality among the First Nations population. Data and methods: The 1991-to-2006 Census Mortality and Cancer Cohort follow-up, which tracked a 15% sample of Canadians aged 25 or older, included 57,300 respondents who self-identified as Registered First Nations people or Indian band members. The Community Well-Being Index (CWB), a measure of the social and economic well-being of communities, consists of income, education, labour force participation, and housing components. A dichotomous variable was used to indicate residence in a community with a CWB score above or below the average for First Nations communities. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) were calculated for First Nations cohort members in communities with CWB scores above and below the First Nations average. Cox proportional hazards models examined the impact of CWB when controlling for individual characteristics. Results: The ASMR for First Nations cohort members in communities with a below-average CWB was 1,057 per 100,000 person-years at risk, compared with 912 for those in communities with an above-average CWB score. For men, living in a community with below-average income and labour force participation CWB scores was associated with an increased hazard of death, even when individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account. Women in communities with below-average income scores had an increased hazard of death. Interpretation: First Nations people in communities with below-average CWB scores tended to have higher mortality rates. For some components of the CWB, effects remained even when individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account. © Minister of Industry, 2016.","Aboriginal health; Age-standardized mortality rates;

However, Inuit in Canada are geographically concentrated-78% live in Inuit Nunangat, and 82% of the areas total population identify as Inuit. While there are limitations, geographic approaches can be employed to calculate mortality for the population of that area. Data and methods: The Vital Statistics Database (1994 to 2008) and population estimates were used to calculate agestandardized mortality rates (ASMRs) in fi ve-year intervals around the 1996 and 2006 Census years. Mortality rates were calculated for 1- to 19-yearolds living in Inuit Nunangat and those living elsewhere in Canada. Results: The ASMR in 2004-2008 for 1- to 19-year-olds in Inuit Nunangat was 188.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years at risk, five times the rate (35.3) elsewhere in Canada. The disparity had not narrowed over the previous decade. In Inuit Nunangat, injuries were responsible for 64% of deaths of children and teenagers, compared with 36% in the rest of Canada. Interpretation: The persistently high mortality rates for children and teenagers living in Inuit Nunangat, compared with the rest of Canada, are important in understanding the health and socio-economic situation of residents of this region.","Aboriginal; Age-standardized mortality rates; Child health; Death rates; Suicide; Vital statistics; Wounds and injuries","","","","","","","","Garner R., Carriere G., Sanmartin C., The health of Inuit, Métis and First Nations adults Living off-reserve in Canada, The impact of socio-economic status on inequalities in health., Health Research Working Paper Series, (2010); Luo Z.C., Senecal S., Simonet F., Et al., Birth outcomes in the Inuit-inhabited areas of Canada, Canadian Medical Association Journal, 182, pp. 235-242, (2010); Peters P.A., Shifting transitions, health inequalities in Inuit Nunangat in perspective, Journal of Rural and Community Development, 7, 1, pp. 35-58, (2012); Inuit in Canada, Selected Findings of the 2006 Census; Wilkins R., Uppal S., Fines P., Et al., Life expectancy in the Inuit-inhabited areas of Canada, 1989 to 2003.\, Health Reports, 19, 1, pp. 7-19, (2008); Mortality, by selected causes of death (ICD-10) and sex, five-year average, Canada and Inuit regions, every 5 years., (2010); Belanger A., Gilbert S., The fertility of immigrant women and their Canadian-born daughters, (2003); Kindig D., Understanding population health terminology, The Milbank Quarterly, 85, pp. 139-161, (2007); Charron S., Penney C., Senecal S., Police-reported crime in Inuit-Nunangat, (2010); Lopez A.D., Mathers C.D., Ezzati M., Et al., Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors, (2006); Peters P.A., Causes and contributions to differences in life expectancy for Inuit Nunangat and Canada, 1994-2003, International Journal of Circumpolar Health, 69, pp. 66-77, (2010); Census Inuit Tables, (2011); Chiang C.L., The Life Table and Its Applications, (1984); Spiegelman M., Introduction to Demography, (1968); Kirmayer L.J., Suicide among Canadian Aboriginal peoples, Transcultural Psychiatry, 31, 1, pp. 3-58, (1994); Kirmayer L.J., Malus M., Boothroyd L.J., Suicide attempts among Inuit youth, a community survey of prevalence and risk factors, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 94, pp. 8-17, (1996); Kirmayer L.J., Boothroyd L., Hodgins S., Attempted suicide among Inuit youth, psychosocial correlates and implications for prevention, Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 43, pp. 816-822, (1998); Boothroyd L., Kirmayer L., Spreng S., Et al., Completed suicides among the Inuit of northern Quebec, 1982-1996, a case control study, Canadian Medical Association Journal, 165, 6, pp. 749-755, (2001); Macaluay A., Orr P., Macdonald S., Et al., Mortality in the Kivalliq region of Nunavut, 1987-1996, International Journal of Circumpolar Health, 63, SUPPL 2, pp. 80-85, (2004); Health Indicators of Inuit Nunangat within the Canadian Context 1994-1998 and, 1999-2003, (2010); Bjerregaard P., Young T.K., Dewailly E., Ebbesson S.O.E., Indigenous health in the Arctic an overview of the circumpolar Inuit population, Scandinavian Journal of Public Health, 32, pp. 390-395, (2004)","L.N.

However, methods used to estimate travel time vary significantly, are not representative of the residential population, and are not openly validated. This makes the assessment of travel-based accessibility metrics between studies incomparable. To address this issue and develop a standardized measurement of emergency service access, this study utilized small geographic units (Dissemination Areas – DA) and geographical boundaries representative of municipal equivalents (Census Subdivision – CSD). Estimated travel times between the centroid of an inhabited DA to each 24-hr emergency department was computed with population-weighted travel times generated for each CSD. This dataset provides a nationally consistent measurement of proximity to emergency services accounting for travel pathing and population distribution. This methodology can be extended to generate estimated shortest travel routes for other healthcare resources or develop actual travel routes based on individuals’ experiences with the healthcare system. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Canada; Emergency Service, Hospital; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Time Factors; Travel; Canada; health care access; hospital emergency service; human; time factor; travel","","","","","","","Marchildon G.P., Allin S., Merkur S., Health Systems in Transition: Canada, Third Edition, Heal Syst Transit Canada, Third Ed, 22, 3, pp. 1-208, (2021); Allin S., Does Equity in Healthcare Use Vary across Canadian Provinces?, Healthc Policy | Polit Santé, 3, 4, pp. 83-99, (2008); Martin D., Et al., Canada’s universal health-care system: achieving its potential, Lancet, 391, pp. 1718-1735, (2018); Dhalla I.A., Tepper J., Improving the quality of health care in Canada, Cmaj, 190, 39, pp. E1162-E1167, (2018); Hansen W.G., How accessibility Shapes Land Use, J Am Inst Plann, 25, 2, pp. 73-76, (1959); Ingram D.R., The concept of accessibility: A search for an opterational form, Reg Stud, 5, 2, pp. 101-107, (1971); Panagiotopoulos G., Kaliampakos D., Accessibility and Spatial Inequities in Greece, Appl Spat Anal, 12, pp. 567-586, (2019); Lovett A., Haynes R., Sunnenberg G., Gale S., Car travel time and accessibility by bus to general practitioner services:a study using patient registers and GIS, Soc Sci Med, 55, pp. 97-111, (2002); Wang J., Du F., Huang J., Liu Y., Access to hospitals: Potential vs. observed, Cities, 100, (2020); Chen B.Y., Et al., Measuring place-based accessibility under travel time uncertainty, Int J Geogr Inf Sci, 31, 4, pp. 783-804, (2017); Sayani A.N., Et al., Patient Partner and Co-founder Patient Advisors Network Toronto, ON President and Chief Executive Officer Canadian Cancer Survivor Network Ottawa, ON, Healthc Policy, 17, 1, pp. 2021-2038, (2021); Hawthorne T.L., Kwan M.-P., Using GIS and percieved distance to understand the unequal geographies of healthcare in lower-income urban nighbourhoods, Geogr J, 178, 1, pp. 18-30, (2011); Pan X., Xu M., Distributed situational observer in a displaced orbit: relative dynamics and control, J Astron Telesc Instruments, Syst, 4, 4, (2018); Wong S.T., Regan S., Patient perspectives on primary health care in rural communities: effects of geography on access, continuity and efficiency, Rural Remote Health, 9, 1, (2009); Weinhold I., Gurtner S., Understanding shortages of sufficient health care in rural areas, Health Policy (New York)., 118, 2, pp. 201-201, (2014); Lavoie J.G., Et al., Underutilized and undertheorized: The use of hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions for assessing the extent to which primary healthcare services are meeting needs in British Columbia First Nation communities, BMC Health Serv Res, 19, 50, pp. 1-10, (2019); Parlier A.B., Galvin S.L., Thach S., Kruidenier D., Fagan E.B., The Road to Rural Primary Care, Acad Med, 93, 1, pp. 130-140, (2018); Moir M., Barua B., COVID exacerbates—not creates—Canada’s long health-care wait times [Internet], Fraser Institute, (2021); Barbieri S., Jorm L., Travel times to hospitals in Australia, Sci Data [Internet], 6, 1, pp. 2-7, (2019); Nicholl J., West J., Goodacre S., Turner J., The relationship between distance to hospital and patient mortality in emergencies: An observational study, Emerg Med J, 24, 9, pp. 665-668, (2007); Bertoli P., Grembi V., The life‐saving effect of hospital proximity, Heal Econ, 26, pp. 78-91, (2017); Doumouras A.G., Saleh F., Hong D., The effect of distance on short-term outcomes in a regionalized, publicly funded bariatric surgery model, Surg Endosc, 33, 4, pp. 1167-1173, (2019); The Open Database of Healthcare Facilities (No. 13260001 - No. 2020001)., (2020); Dissemination Area Boundary Files (No. 92-169-X), (2022); .

This is a first step to understanding the policy-oriented prevention system that has evolved in these areas over time. Methods: Regulatory data were compiled from Part II of the Territorial Gazette Indices and the Revised Statutes and Regulations of each territory. Regulations were categorized as open, restricted, prohibited or other. Results: The number of communities with some form of regulation has increased steadily over time with half of the sample communities adopting some form of regulation between 1970 and 2008. The use of prohibition as a policy choice peaked in 1980 but has remained relatively steady since that time. There has been a steady increase in the adoption of other kinds of restrictions. Communities with regulations tend to have smaller and younger populations, a greater percentage of people with First Nations, Métis or Inuit origin and are more geographically isolated than those with no regulation. Conclusions: This is the first time alcohol control policies have been compiled and described for the Canadian north. The dataset records the collective energies being put into community problem solving and provides a means to interpret the prevalence of health and social problems linked to alcohol use in these communities over time. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Aboriginal;

The Framework for Action, as its title suggests, sought to put in place a framework for goal realisation in education planning and practice primarily, but not exclusively, in developing countries. This paper assesses the extent to which global goals and summaries of progress mask the difficulties faced in local education delivery, focusing on access to and use of spatial data in the education planning process. Attention is focused on the situation in Peru in general and in the District of Independencia in the Cono Norte of Lima in particular. The quality of spatial and other data resources and the technical difficulties in assembling these into a form that can support local decision making in education planning and governance suggests that there remain significant obstacles in achieving a quality education for all, especially in developing countries. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Prior to the creation of this Cohort, no national population-based Canadian cohort was available to examine mortality by socioeconomic indicators. The 1991 Canadian Census Cohort was created via the linkage of a subsample of respondents from the mandatory 1991 Canadian Census long-form to historical tax summary files, Canadian Mortality Database, Canadian Cancer Database, 1991 Health and Activity Limitation Survey and a sub-sample of the Longitudinal Worker File. Overall ascertainment of mortality and cancer is anticipated to be nearly complete and the Cohort is broadly representative of most groups in the Canadian population. The Cohort has been used to examine mortality outcomes by different indicators of socioeconomic status, occupational categories, ethnic groups, educational attainment, and for exposure to ambient air pollution. Results have shown that the estimated remaining years of life at age 25 differed substantially by income adequacy quintile, educational attainment, housing type and Aboriginal ancestry. © The Author 2013; all rights reserved.","Canada; Cohort studies; Mortality; Neoplasms; Socioeconomic factors","Adult; Aged; Canada; Cause of Death; Censuses; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Income; Information Storage and Retrieval; Male; Middle Aged; Mobility Limitation; Neoplasms; Socioeconomic Factors; Canada; atmospheric pollution; cancer; census; cohort analysis; data set; database; mortality; population structure; socioeconomic status; 1991 canadian census cohort; Aborigine; adult; aged; air pollution; ambient air; article; Canada; cohort analysis; data base; educational status; environmental exposure; ethnic group; female; follow up; health status; housing; human; income; longevity; major clinical study; male; mortality; neoplasm; population; population dynamics; priority journal; risk factor; smoking; social status; cause of death; cohort analysis; factual database; income; information retrieval; middle aged; Neoplasms; population research; socioeconomics; walking difficulty","","","","","Statistics Canada and Health Canada; Clean Air Regulatory Agenda","Statistics Canada and the Canadian Population Health Initiative of the Canadian Institute for Health Information provided funding for the creation of the original 1991 follow-up study.

We therefore undertook a national study in Canada to examine associations between urban greenness and cause-specific mortality. Methods We used data from a large cohort study (the 2001 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort [2001 CanCHEC]), which consisted of approximately 1·3 million adult (aged ≥19 years), non-immigrant, urban Canadians in 30 cities who responded to the mandatory 2001 Statistics Canada long-form census. The cohort has been linked by Statistics Canada to the Canadian mortality database and to annual income tax filings through 2011. We measured greenness with images from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer from NASA's Aqua satellite. We assigned estimates of exposure to greenness derived from remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within both 250 m and 500 m of participants' residences for each year during 11 years of follow-up (between 2001 and 2011). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between residential greenness (as a continuous variable) and mortality. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs per IQR (0·15) increase in NDVI adjusted for personal (eg, education and income) and contextual covariates, including exposures to fine particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. We also considered effect modification by selected personal covariates (age, sex, household income adequacy quintiles, highest level of education, and marital status). Findings Our cohort consisted of approximately 1 265 000 million individuals at baseline who contributed 11 523 770 person-years. We showed significant decreased risks of mortality in the range of 8–12% from all causes of death examined with increased greenness around participants' residence. In the fully adjusted analyses, the risk was significantly decreased for all causes of death (non-accidental HR 0·915, 95% CI 0·905–0·924; cardiovascular plus diabetes 0·911, 0·895–0·928; cardiovascular 0·911, 0·894–0·928; ischaemic heart disease 0·904, 0·882–0·927; cerebrovascular 0·942, 0·902–0·983; and respiratory 0·899, 0·869–0·930). Greenness associations were more protective among men than women (HR 0·880, 95% CI 0·868–0·893 vs 0·955, 0·941–0·969), and among individuals with higher incomes (highest quintile 0·812, 0·791–0·834 vs lowest quintile 0·991, 0·972–1·011) and more education (degree or more 0·816, 0·791–0·842 vs did not complete high school 0·964, 0·950–0·978). Interpretation Increased amounts of residential greenness were associated with reduced risks of dying from several common causes of death among urban Canadians. We identified evidence of inequalities, both in terms of exposures to greenness and mortality risks, by personal socioeconomic status among individuals living in generally similar environments, and with reasonably similar access to health care and other social services. The findings support the development of policies related to creating greener and healthier cities. Funding None. © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Research design and methods-We evaluated the association between longterm exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and diabetes-related mortality in a prospective cohort analysis of 2.1 million adults from the 1991 Canadian census mortality follow-up study. Mortality information, including ;5,200 deaths coded as diabetes being the underlying cause, was ascertained by linkage to the Canadian Mortality Database from 1991 to 2001. Subject-level estimates of long-term exposure to PM2.5 were derived from satellite observations. The hazard ratios (HRs) for diabetes- relatedmortality were related to PM2.5 and adjusted for individual-level and contextual variables using Cox proportional hazards survival models. Results-Mean PM2.5 exposure levels for the entire population were low (8.7 mg/m3; SD, 3.9 mg/m3; interquartile range, 6.2 mg/m3). In fully adjusted models, a 10-mg/m3 elevation in PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increase in risk for diabetes-related mortality (HR, 1.49; 95%CI, 1.37-1.62). The monotonic change in risk to the population persisted to PM2.5 concentration ,5 mg/m3. Conclusions-Long-termexposure to PM2.5, even at low levels, is related to an increased risk of mortality attributable to diabetes. These findings have considerable public health importance given the billions of people exposed to air pollution and the worldwide growing epidemic of diabetes. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adult;

Previous studies indicate increased risks of hematopoietic cancers and decreased risks at other sites, possibly due to differences in lifestyle or risk behaviours. We present findings from CanCHEC (Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort), the largest national population-based cohort of agricultural workers. Methods: Statistics Canada created the cohort using deterministic and probabilistic linkage of the 1991 Canadian Long Form Census to National Cancer Registry records for 1992-2010. Self-reported occupations were coded using the Standard Occupational Classification (1991) system. Analyses were restricted to employed persons aged 25-74 years at baseline (N = 2,051,315), with follow-up until December 31, 2010. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were modeled using Cox proportional hazards for all workers in agricultural occupations (n = 70,570; 70.8% male), stratified by sex, and adjusted for age at cohort entry, province of residence, and highest level of education. Results: A total of 9515 incident cancer cases (7295 in males) occurred in agricultural workers. Among men, increased risks were observed for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.00-1.21), prostate (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.16), melanoma (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.31), and lip cancer (HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.70-2.70). Decreased risks in males were observed for lung, larynx, and liver cancers. Among female agricultural workers there was an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.72). Increased risks of melanoma (HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.17-2.73), leukemia (HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.24-3.25) and multiple myeloma (HR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.16-4.37) were observed in a subset of female crop farmers. Conclusions: Exposure to pesticides may have contributed to increased risks of hematopoietic cancers, while increased risks of lip cancer and melanoma may be attributed to sun exposure. The array of decreased risks suggests reduced smoking and alcohol consumption in this occupational group compared to the general population. © 2017 The Author(s).","","Adult; Aged; Agriculture; Canada; Carcinogens; Censuses; Environment; Farmers; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced; Occupational Exposure; Pesticides; Risk Factors; Solar System; pesticide; carcinogen; pesticide; adult; aged; agricultural worker; alcohol consumption; Article; Canada; cancer incidence; cancer registry; cancer risk; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; larynx cancer; leukemia; lip cancer; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; melanoma; middle aged; multiple myeloma; nonhodgkin lymphoma; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; pancreas cancer; population research; prostate cancer; risk assessment; risk reduction; self report; sex difference; smoking; sun exposure; agricultural worker; agriculture; astronomy; chemically induced; classification; environment; neoplasm; pathology; radiation induced neoplasm; risk factor","","Carcinogens, ; Pesticides, ","","","Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and Statistics Canada; Canadian Institute for Health Information; Statistics Canada; Workers Safety and Insurance Board of Ontario, (11024); Health Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Canadian Research Data Centre Network from the Social Science and Humanities research Council, the Canadian Institute for Health Research, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and Statistics Canada.; Funding text 2: Linkage of the 1991 Canadian Census to the Canadian Cancer Registry was funded by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, Health Canada and Statistics Canada.

Objectives: We examined the association between pregnancy outcomes and fine particulate matter in a large national study including urban and rural areas. Methods: Analyses were based on approximately 3 million singleton live births in Canada between 1999 and 2008. Exposures to PM2.5 (particles of median aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) were assigned by mapping the mother’s postal code to a monthly surface based on a national land use regression model that incorporated observations from fixed-site monitoring stations and satellitederived estimates of PM2.5. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between PM2.5 and preterm birth (gestational age < 37 weeks), term low birth weight (< 2,500 g), small for gestational age (SGA; < 10th percentile of birth weight for gestational age), and term birth weight, adjusting for individual covariates and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES). Results: In fully adjusted models, a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 over the entire pregnancy was associated with SGA (odds ratio = 1.04; 95% CI 1.01, 1.07) and reduced term birth weight (-20.5 g; 95% CI -24.7, -16.4). Associations varied across subgroups based on maternal place of birth and period (1999-2003 vs. 2004-2008). Conclusions: This study, based on approximately 3 million births across Canada and employing PM2.5 estimates from a national spatiotemporal model, provides further evidence linking PM2.5 and pregnancy outcomes. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

To examine the differential effects of between- versus within-city contrasts in pollution exposure, we used both ambient measurements and land use regression models to assess associations with mortality and exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) among ∼735,600 adults in 10 of the largest Canadian cities. We estimated exposure contrasts partitioned into within- and between-city contrasts, and the sum of these as overall exposures, for every year from 1984 to 2006. Residential histories allowed us to follow subjects annually during the study period. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for many personal and contextual variables. In fully-adjusted, random-effects models, we found positive associations between overall NO2 exposures and mortality from non-accidental causes (HR per 5 p.p.b.: 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.07), cardiovascular disease (HR per 5 p.p.b.: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06), ischaemic heart disease (HR per 5 p.p.b.: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02-1.08) and respiratory disease (HR per 5 p.p.b.: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.99-1.08), but not from cerebrovascular disease (HR per 5 p.p.b.: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.96-1.06). We found that most of these associations were determined by within-city contrasts, as opposed to by between-city contrasts in NO2. Our results suggest that variation in NO2 concentrations within a city may represent a more toxic mixture of pollution than variation between cities. © 2015 Nature America, Inc.

Previous studies have reported a high correlation between ground level PM2.5 and NO2 estimated by RS and measurements collected at regulatory monitoring sites. The current study examined associations between air pollution and adverse respiratory and allergic health outcomes using multi-year averages of NO2 and PM2.5 from RS and from regulatory monitoring. RS estimates were derived using satellite measurements from OMI, MODIS, and MISR instruments. Regulatory monitoring data were obtained from Canada's National Air Pollution Surveillance Network. Self-reported prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma, current asthma, allergies, and chronic bronchitis were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey (a national sample of individuals 12 years of age and older). Multi-year ambient pollutant averages were assigned to each study participant based on their six digit postal code at the time of health survey, and were used as a marker for long-term exposure to air pollution. RS derived estimates of NO2 and PM2.5 were associated with 6-10% increases in respiratory and allergic health outcomes per interquartile range (3.97μgm-3 for PM2.5 and 1.03ppb for NO2) among adults (aged 20-64) in the national study population. Risk estimates for air pollution and respiratory/allergic health outcomes based on RS were similar to risk estimates based on regulatory monitoring for areas where regulatory monitoring data were available (within 40km of a regulatory monitoring station). RS derived estimates of air pollution were also associated with adverse health outcomes among participants residing outside the catchment area of the regulatory monitoring network (p<0.05).The consistency between risk estimates based on RS and regulatory monitoring as well as the associations between air pollution and health among participants living outside the catchment area for regulatory monitoring suggest that RS can provide useful estimates of long-term ambient air pollution in epidemiologic studies. This is particularly important in rural communities and other areas where monitoring and modeled air pollution data are limited or unavailable. •Remote sensing (RS) and regulatory monitoring (RM) were used to estimate air pollution. © 2013.","Air pollution; Allergy; Asthma; Epidemiology; Population health; Regulatory monitoring; Satellite remote sensing","Canada; Air pollution; Allergies; Catchments; Diseases; Epidemiology; Estimation; Health; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Remote sensing; Runoff; Satellites; Surveys; Ambient air pollution; Asthma; Epidemiologic-study; Inter quartile ranges; Population health; Satellite measurements; Satellite remote sensing; Surveillance networks; allergy; asthma; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; health impact; health status; health survey; MISR; MODIS; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; remote sensing; risk assessment; satellite imagery; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; allergy; ambient air; article; asthma; chronic bronchitis; comparative study; female; health survey; home; human; long term exposure; male; priority journal; remote sensing; rural area; self report; Monitoring","","","","","","","Ali J.S., McDermott S., Gravel R.G., Recent research on immigrant health from statistics Canada's population surveys, Can.

Methods: WBV exposure was assigned based on occupation in 1991 and 1,107,700 participants were followed for incident prostate cancer until the end of 2003. Adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results: 17,922 incident prostate cancer cases were observed. WBV-exposed men in Natural and Applied Sciences Occupations had a 37% elevated risk of prostate cancer (95% CI 1.09-1.72) and WBV-exposed men in Trades, Transport, and Equipment Operators Occupations had a 9% reduced risk (95% CI 0.86-0.97). Independent of WBV exposure, small but significant differences in risk were seen for several occupational categories. Conclusions: We found no consistent relationship between WBV and prostate cancer. Further research could focus on other exposures or specific occupations in the studied categories to determine what may be contributing to the observed differences in prostate cancer risk. Am. J.

We sought to develop a method to estimate the risk of death from long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the distribution of its components, namely: sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, organic mass, black carbon, and mineral dust. We decomposed PM2.5 exposure into the sum of total concentration and the proportion of each component. We estimated the risk of death due to exposure using a cohort of ∼2.4 million Canadians who were followed for vital status over 16 years. Modelling the concentration of PM2.5 with the distribution of the proportions of components together was a superior predictor for mortality than either total PM2.5 concentration alone, or all component concentrations modelled together. Our new approach has the advantage of characterizing the toxicity of the atmosphere in its entirety. This is required to fully understand the health benefits associated with strategies to improve air quality that may result in complex changes not only in PM2.5 concentration, but also in the distribution of particle components. © 2016, Nature Publishing Group.

While various types of meat-restricted diets exist to address this, not enough is known about how the average meat consumer views different avenues to lessening their intake. In response, this study aims to assess US omnivores’ impressions of three meat-restricted diets. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was administered to a cross-sectional, census-balanced sample from Nielsen of 30,000+ US adults. Omnivores (N = 928) were randomized into one of the three conditions where they were asked about their perceptions of a vegetarian diet, a reduced-meat diet or a chicken-free diet as individuals not currently following that dietary pattern. Findings: The findings showed that omnivores had a more favorable perception of a reduced-meat diet on a greater number of study variables as compared to the vegetarian or chicken-free diets. The research also demonstrated that a majority of omnivores were in the precontemplation stage of cognitive change, suggesting that most American omnivores are not actively demonstrating a readiness to alter their meat consumption in the ways presented. Originality/value: This research is the first to examine the comparative trends around these three diets among omnivores. It also speaks to how the desirability of meat restriction varies by type of approach, i.e. elimination or reduction, and if the latter, what type. The findings may be of relevance for efforts to reduce global meat consumption for ethical, health, or environmental reasons. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Chicken consumption; Diet; Meat reduction; Meat restriction; Omnivores; Vegetarian","adult; article; avoidance behavior; chicken; consumer; controlled study; diet restriction; dietary pattern; female; human experiment; major clinical study; male; meat consumption; nonhuman; omnivore; perception; randomized controlled trial; vegetarian diet","","","","","University of New Brunswick, UNB; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The authors offer thanks to Dr. Gary Bowden and Dr. Elizabeth Cherry for their considerable contributions to this work, members of the Department of Sociology at the University of New Brunswick, and individuals who offered feedback on the study's design.Declaration of interest statement: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Innovation Foundation, VegFund, and a fiscal sponsorship managed by Faunalytics.

As such, this scoping review systematically collated academic literature and subsequently synthesised (1) the time trend of studies employing geographic methods to understand SGBV, (2) the context in which geographic methods are being used to understand SGBV (i.e. objectives), (3) study characteristics, and (4) the methods and data sources used. A total of six databases were searched: Gender Studies, PsychINFO, Scopus, PudMed, Cochrane, and Campbell. Following title-abstract (n = 3354) and full-text screening (n = 159), 42 studies met data extraction criteria. From our review, there is clear momentum in the use of geographic methods to understand trends in SGBV. The majority of studies stated objectives aligning with assessing risk of SGBV (n = 35, 83.3%), while the remaining aimed to assess SGBV service availability. As research expands, there is notable focus on urban and suburban areas and a dominant dependence on institutional data sources (e.g. hospitals and police data), which hold certain caveats when it comes to structural barriers to SGBV data collection, such as fear of reporting and historic distrust in institutional services.

Methods: A partitioned regression approach for linear models is applied to time to event survival analyses of cohort study data. Information on the correlation between observed and missing risk factors is obtained from ancillary data sources such as national health surveys. The relationship between the missing risk factors and survival is obtained from previously published studies. We first evaluated the methodology using simulations, by considering the Weibull survival distribution for a proportional hazards regression model with varied baseline functions, correlations between an adjusted variable and an adjustment variable as well as selected censoring rates. Then we illustrate the method in a large, representative Canadian cohort of the association between concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter and mortality from ischemic heart disease. Results: Indirect adjustment for cigarette smoking habits and obesity increased the fine particulate matter-ischemic heart disease association by 3%-123%, depending on the number of variables considered in the adjustment model due to the negative correlation between these two risk factors and ambient air pollution concentrations in Canada. The simulations suggested that the method yielded small relative bias (<40%) for most cohort designs encountered in environmental epidemiology. Conclusions: This method can accommodate adjustment for multiple missing risk factors simultaneously while accounting for the associations between observed and missing risk factors and between missing risk factors and health endpoints. © 2014.","Air pollution; Cohort study; Indirect adjustment; Simulation; Survival analysis","Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Survival Analysis; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; epidemiology; health survey; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; regression analysis; risk factor; Weibull theory; adult; air pollution; ambient air; Article; Canadian; cardiovascular mortality; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); confounding variable; correlational study; disease association; environmental exposure; epidemiology; health survey; human; indirect adjustment; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; obesity; particulate matter; partition coefficient; proportional hazards model; regression analysis; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking habit; statistical analysis; survival; environmental exposure; theoretical model","","","","","","","Axelson O., Aspects of confounding and effect modification in the assessment of occupational cancer risk, J.

Quantitative estimates of attributable mortality are based on disease-specific hazard ratio models that incorporate risk information from multiple PM2.5 sources (outdoor and indoor air pollution from use of solid fuels and secondhand and active smoking), requiring assumptions about equivalent exposure and toxicity. We relax these contentious assumptions by constructing a PM2.5-mortality hazard ratio function based only on cohort studies of outdoor air pollution that covers the global exposure range. We modeled the shape of the association between PM2.5 and nonaccidental mortality using data from 41 cohorts from 16 countries-the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). We then constructed GEMMs for five specific causes of death examined by the global burden of disease (GBD). The GEMM predicts 8.9 million [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.5-10.3] deaths in 2015, a figure 30% larger than that predicted by the sum of deaths among the five specific causes (6.9; 95% CI: 4.9-8.5) and 120% larger than the risk function used in the GBD (4.0; 95% CI: 3.3-4.8). Differences between the GEMM and GBD risk functions are larger for a 20% reduction in concentrations, with the GEMM predicting 220% higher excess deaths. These results suggest that PM2.5 exposure may be related to additional causes of death than the five considered by the GBD and that incorporation of risk information from other, nonoutdoor, particle sources leads to underestimation of disease burden, especially at higher concentrations. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

We examined the association between sedentary work, based on body position, and colorectal cancer risk in Canadians. Methods A working body position category (a. sitting; b. standing and walking; c. sitting, standing, and walking; d. other) was assigned to occupations reported by 1991 Canadian Census respondents based on national occupational counselling guidelines. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for cancers of the colon (overall, proximal, and distal) and rectum in men and women newly diagnosed from 1992 to 2010. Results Compared to “sitting” jobs, men in occupations with “other” (non-sitting, −standing, or −walking) body positions had a weakly significant reduced colon cancer risk (HR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89, 0.98) primarily attributed to protection at the distal site (HR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.97). Men in “standing and walking” and “sitting, standing, and walking” jobs did not have significantly reduced colon cancer risks. No effects were observed for rectal cancer in men or colon and rectal cancer in women. Conclusion The two significant findings of this analysis should be followed-up in further investigations with additional information on potential confounders. Null findings for rectal cancer were consistent with other studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","(MeSH): Cohort study; Colon cancer; Occupation; Rectal cancer; Sedentary lifestyle","Adult; Canada; Censuses; Cohort Studies; Colonic Neoplasms; Environment; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupations; Proportional Hazards Models; Rectal Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Sedentary Lifestyle; adult; age; Article; ascending colon; body position; Canadian; cancer risk; cohort analysis; colon cancer; colorectal cancer; descending colon; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; rectum cancer; risk reduction; sitting; standing; walking; Canada; colon tumor; environment; middle aged; occupation; population research; proportional hazards model; rectum tumor; risk factor; sedentary lifestyle; statistics and numerical data","","","","","","","CCS, Canadian Cancer Statistics, (2015); CCS, Colorectal Cancer, (2015); Short E., Thomas L.E., Hurley J., Jose S., Sampson J.R., Inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer: towards a more complete picture, J.

These and other factors have created divergent, and highly fragmented patterns of spatial segregation at all geographic levels. However, little empirical evidence has captured the extent and magnitude of spatial segregation of the poor within specific mega-cities. The combination of advanced spatial segregation indicators with statistical measures allows for the detection and measurement of segregation between multiple groups at multiple scales across the urban region. The paper explores the extent of spatial segregation of different socio-economic groups in Lima, Peru, using 1993 census and more recently released data, presenting a methodology for integrating older and newer data sources. The results indicate that segregation across the Metropolitan Region is localized, with ""pockets"" of difference across otherwise seemingly homogeneous areas.","Lima; Poverty; Segregation; Urban development","Lima [Peru]; Peru; South America; megacity; metropolitan area; poverty; social segregation; urban development","","","","","","","Aliaga-Linares L., Sumas y restas: El capital social como recurso de la informalidad, redes sociales de los comerciantes ambulantes en independencia, (2002); Borsdorf, Axel, Cómo modelar el desarrollo y la dinámica de la ciudad latino-americana, EURE-Revista Latinoameticana de Estudios Urbano Regionales, 29, pp. 37-49, (2003); Calderon J., Acceso por los pobres al suelo urbano y mercados inmobiliarios en Lima Metropolitana, (1999); Calderon J., The formalisation of property in Peru, 2001-2002: The case of Lima, Habitat International, 28, pp. 289-300, (2004); De Soto H., The mystery of capital: Why capitalism triumphs in the West and fails everywhere else, (2000); Duncan O.D., Duncan B., A methodological analysis of segregation indexes, American Sociological Review, 20, pp. 210-217, (1955); Ebdon D., Statistics in geography, (1988); Fay M., Ruggeri Laderchi C., Urban poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean: Setting the stage, The urban poor in Latin America, pp. 19-46, (2005); Fay M., Wellenstein A., Keeping a roof over one's head: Improving access to safe and decent shelter, The urban poor in Latin America, pp. 91-124, (2005); Gilbert A., Land, housing, and infrastructure in Latin America's major cities, The mega-city in Latin America, pp. 73-109, (1996); Gilbert A., The Latin American City, (1998); Gilbert A., Ward P.M., Housing, the state, and the poor: Policy and practice in three Latin American cities, (1985); Golte J., Adams N., Los caballos de troya de los invasores: Estrategias campesinas en la conquista de la Gran Lima, (1987); Gregory D., Geographical imaginations, (1994); Griffith D.A., Some guidelines for specifying the geographic weights matrix contained in spatial statistical models, Practical handbook of spatial statistics, pp. 65-82, (1985); Hall G.B., Peters P.A., Global ideals and local practicalities in education policies and planning in Lima, Peru, Habitat International, 27, pp. 629-651, (2003); IX censo de población y IV de vivienda 1993, (1993); James D.R., Taeuber K.E., Measures of segregation, Sociological Methodology, 15, pp. 1-32, (1985); Janoschka M., The new model of the Latin American city: Fragmentation and privatization, EURE-Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Urbano Regionales, 27, pp. 11-29, (2002); Joseph J.A., Sustainable development and democracy in the megacities, Development in Practice, 11, pp. 218-231, (2001); Joseph J.A., Public spaces in a segregated city: Problems and perspectives from Lima.

Hospital admission records from January 2004 to March, 2014 were sourced from the New Brunswick Discharge Abstract Database. Seasonality was measured using a cosinor model to estimate the phase, amplitude, and peak of seasonal variations in psychiatric admissions over the 12-month period from January through December. A general linear model using a Poisson distribution was used to calculate rate ratios that measured the significance of monthly variations in psychiatric admissions. We adjusted for the average number of days per month and provincial population counts using offsets in both models. Between 2004 and 2014, there were 57,730 mental health-related hospital admissions by 41,690 patients. Psychiatric admissions by children and adolescents (aged 3-19 years) increased from 44 admissions per 100,000 in 2004 to 51 admissions per 100,000 in 2014. Rates of psychiatric admissions among children, adolescents, and adults exhibited seasonality confirmed through the detection of a statistically significant sinusoidal pattern (p < .025). The highest rates of child and adolescent admissions were in February (phase = 2, amplitude = 4.4), whereas adult admissions to the hospital peaked in early May (phase = 5.3, amplitude = 9.7). These findings lend support to existing efforts to identify the complex array of individual, family, community, and environmental factors that influence the likelihood of acute care utilization for management of psychiatric disorders. © 2018 Canadian Psychological Association.","Canada; Health care utilization; Health services research; Mental health services; Psychiatry","","","","","","CIHR-SPOR-MSSU; University of New Brunswick, UNB; Fondation de la recherche en santé du Nouveau-Brunswick, FRSNB; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR; Department of Health and Social Care, DH; Department of Health, Australian Government","Funding text 1: Amanda K.

Specifically, the research objectives are to: (1) document the major flows of internal migration into the São Paulo metropolitan area; (2) map both short- and long-term migrant patterns of settlement within the São Paulo metropolitan area; and (3) approximate to what extent particular migrants from specific sending areas spatially concentrate in certain neighborhoods within the metropolitan area using both non-spatial and spatial measures of segregation. The key feature of our theoretical argument is that migrant networks evolve, accumulate, and generate higher than expected levels of internal migration to particular neighborhoods. As internal migrants become increasingly concentrated and a dynamic feedback process emerges between origin and destination, the metropolis becomes both segmented and segregated.

The role of traffic-related air pollutants is less clear. To better understand the role of traffic-related air pollutants in cardiovascular disease development, we examined associations between NO2, carotid atherosclerotic plaque, and cardiometabolic disorders associated with cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses were conducted among 2227 patients (62.9±13.8 years; 49.5% women) from the Stroke Prevention and Atherosclerosis Research Centre (SPARC) in London, Ontario, Canada. Total carotid plaque area measured by ultrasound, cardiometabolic disorders, and residential locations were provided by SPARC medical records. Long-term outdoor residential NO2 concentrations were generated by a land use regression model. Associations between NO2, total carotid plaque area, and cardiometabolic disorders were examined using multiple regression models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and socioeconomic status. Mean NO2 was 5.4±1.6 ppb in London, Ontario. NO2 was associated with a significant increase in plaque (3.4 mm2 total carotid plaque area per 1 ppb NO2), exhibiting a linear dose-response. NO2 was also positively associated with triglycerides, total cholesterol, and the ratio of low-to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P<0.05). Diabetes mellitus mediated the relationship between NO2 and total carotid plaque area (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that even low levels of traffic-related air pollutants are linked to atherosclerotic plaque burden, an association that may be partially attributable to pollution-induced diabetes mellitus. Our findings suggest that reducing ambient concentrations in cities with NO2 below current standards would result in additional health benefits. Given the billions of people exposed to traffic emissions, our study supports the global public health significance of reducing air pollution. © 2020 The Authors.","Air pollution; Atherosclerosis; Atherosclerotic plaque;

These differences can be seen in broad indicators of the social determinants of health. Studies of mortality in Aboriginal populations across Canada are often restricted by the lack of Aboriginal identifiers on national death records. While some studies have utilised a record-linkage approach, this is often not possible for the entire country or for recent data. Some researchers have adopted a geographic approach and examined mortality and morbidity in areas that have a high percentage of Aboriginal identity residents, and have uniformly reported elevated rates of mortality and morbidity compared with other areas. The purpose of this article was to examine child and youth mortality (aged 1 to 19 years) in areas where a high percentage of the population identified as First Nations in comparison with areas where there is a low percentage of Aboriginal identity residents. Using a geographic threshold table approach, areas with a high percentage of Aboriginal identity peoples were classified as either First Nations, Métis, or Inuit communities based on the predominant identity group. The upper one-third of the total Aboriginal population distribution was used as a cut-off for high percentage First Nations areas, where 97.7% of the population aged 1-19 were of First Nations identity in 2006 (N=140 779). Mortality rates were then calculated for high-percentage First Nations identity areas and compared with low-percentage Aboriginal identity areas, excluding high-percentage Métis or Inuit identity areas. Deaths were aggregated for the 3 years surrounding the 2001 and 2006 census periods, and a total of 473 deaths were recorded for 2000-2002 and 493 deaths for 2005-2007. Analysis was facilitated via the correspondence of six-digit residential postal codes on vital statistics records to census geographical areas using automated geo-coding software (Statistics Canada; PCCF+). Age-standardized mortality rates for children and youth in high-percentage First Nations identity areas were significantly higher than in low-percentage Aboriginal identity areas. The rate ratio for all-cause mortality for boys was 3.2 (CI: 2.9-3.6) for 2005-2007 and 3.6 (CI: 3.2-4.2) for girls. Mortality rates for injuries had the largest difference, with rate ratios of 4.7 (CI: 4.0-5.5) and 5.3 (CI:4.5-6.3) for boys in 2000-2002 and 2005-2007 and 5.5 (CI: 4.4-6.8) and 8.3 (CI: 6.8-10.1) for girls in the same period. A strength of this study is that it is the first to use national-level vital statistics registration data across two time periods to report mortality by cause for children and youth living in high-percentage First Nations areas. Vital events were geographically coded to high-percentage First Nations identity areas and compared with low-percentage Aboriginal identity areas at the Dissemination Areas level. This area-based methodology allows for mortality to be calculated for children and youth by sex and by detailed cause of death for multiple time periods. The results provide key evidence for the persistent differences in the causes of death for children and youth living in high-percentage First Nations identity areas.","","Adolescent; Adult; Canada; Cause of Death; Child; Child Mortality; Child, Preschool; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Indians, North American; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Inuits; Male; Mortality; Socioeconomic Factors; adolescent; adult; American Indian; article; Canada; cause of death; child; childhood mortality; female; health disparity; human; infant; infant mortality; Inuit; male; mortality; newborn; preschool child; socioeconomics; statistics","","","","","","","","P.A.

Objective: We investigated associations between cause-specific mortality and ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a national cohort of about 2.5 million Canadians. Methods: We assigned estimates of annual concentrations of these pollutants to the residential postal codes of subjects for each year during 16 years of follow-up. Historical tax data allowed us to track subjects’ residential postal code annually. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for each pollutant separately and adjusted for the other pollutants. We also estimated the product of the three HRs as a measure of the cumulative association with mortality for several causes of death for an increment of the mean minus the 5th percentile of each pollutant: 5.0 μg/m3 for PM2.5, 9.5 ppb for O3, and 8.1 ppb for NO2. Results: PM2.5, O3, and NO2 were associated with nonaccidental and cause-specific mortality in single-pollutant models. Exposure to PM2.5 alone was not sufficient to fully characterize the toxicity of the atmospheric mix or to fully explain the risk of mortality associated with exposure to ambient pollution. Assuming additive associations, the estimated HR for nonaccidental mortality corresponding to a change in exposure from the mean to the 5th percentile for all three pollutants together was 1.075 (95% CI: 1.067, 1.084). Accounting for residential mobility had only a limited impact on the association between mortality and PM2.5 and O3, but increased associa-tions with NO2. conclusions: In this large, national-level cohort, we found positive associations between several common causes of death and exposure to PM2.5, O3, and NO2. © 2015, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Data on levels of obesity and moderate physical activity were derived from the results of a telephone survey conducted in 2006, with 1,863 survey respondents in the study sample. This sample was spread across eight suburban neighborhoods in Metro Vancouver. These areas were selected to contrast residential density and income and do not constitute a random sample, but within each area, respondents were selected randomly. Obesity and moderate physical activity were mapped to determine levels of global and local spatial autocorrelation within the neighborhoods. Clustering was measured using Moran's I at the global level, Anselin's Local Moran's I at the local level, and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The global-level spatial analysis reveals no significant clustering for the attributes of obesity or moderate physical activity. Within individual neighborhoods, there is moderate clustering of obesity and/or physical activity but these clusters do not achieve statistical significance. In some neighborhoods, local clustering is restricted to a single pair of respondents with moderate physical activity. In other neighborhoods, any moderate local clustering is offset by negative local spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, there is no evidence of significant clustering for the attribute of obesity at either the global or local level of analysis. The GWR analysis fails to improve significantly upon the global modelthus reinforcing the negative results. Overall, the study indicates that the relationship between the urban environment and obesity is not direct. © 2009 The Obesity Society.","","Adult; Canada; Cluster Analysis; Exercise; Geography; Health Surveys;

Maternal age and smoking are risk factors and aboriginal communities may be more commonly affected. Factors leading to this increased incidence are otherwise unclear. We investigate maternal sociodemography, air pollution and personal risk factors comparing mothers of infants with GS with a control group of infants with diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in a large population-based analysis. Methods: Data were collected from a national, disease-specific pediatric surgical database (May 2006–June 2013). Maternal community sociodemographic information was derived from the Canadian 2006 Census. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed examining maternal factors related to diagnosis of GS. Results: GS infants come from poorer, less educated communities with more unemployment, less pollution, fewer immigrants, and more aboriginal peoples than infants with CDH. Teen maternal age, smoking, and illicit drug use, are associated with GS. Conclusion: Mothers of infants with GS are younger, more likely to smoke and come from socially disadvantaged communities with higher proportions of aboriginal peoples but lower levels of air pollution compared to mothers of CDH infants. Identification of maternal risks provides direction for prenatal screening and public health interventions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aboriginal health; Congenital diaphragmatic hernia; Epidemiology; Gastroschisis; Maternal predictors; Public health","Adult; Air Pollution; Canada; Female; Gastroschisis; Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Age; Mothers; Population Groups; Pregnancy; Risk Factors; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Street Drugs; Young Adult; street drug; adult; air pollution; Article; Canada; comparative study; congenital diaphragm hernia; controlled study; diaphragm hernia; drug use; female; gastroschisis; human; immigrant; infant; major clinical study; maternal age; priority journal; risk factor; smoking; unemployment; gastroschisis; Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital; incidence; mother; newborn; population group; pregnancy; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; young adult","","Street Drugs, ","","","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (117139); Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation","Funding text 1: This study is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Funding Reference # Sec 117139 and the MacNeill Chair, Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation. ; Funding text 2: We are grateful to all the centers in Canada that contribute data to CAPSNet.

However, these datasets frequently contain individual-level geographic information (such as postal codes). This paper explains the methodology for creating Geozones, which are area-based thresholds of population characteristics derived from census data, which can be used in the analysis of social or economic differences in health and health service utilization. With aggregate 2006 Census information at the Dissemination Area level, population concentration and exposure for characteristics of interest are analysed using threshold tables and concentration curves. Examples are presented for the Aboriginal population and for income gradients. The patterns of concentration of First Nations people, Métis, and Inuit differ from those of non-Aboriginal people and between urban and rural areas. The spatial patterns of concentration and exposure by income gradients also differ. The Geozones method is a relatively easy way of identifying areas with lower and higher concentrations of subgroups. Because it is ecological-based, Geozones has the inherent strengths and weaknesses of this approach.","","Canada; Censuses; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Health Services; Health Status; Humans; Income; Indians, North American; Inuits; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Small-Area Analysis; Socioeconomic Factors; American Indian; article; Canada; cluster analysis; Eskimo; health service; health status; human; income; methodology; outcome assessment; population research; socioeconomics; statistical analysis; statistics; utilization review","","","","","","","","P.A.

The project has a strong focus on electronic health (eHealth) but covers other areas of innovation as well. The project has been designed as an ethnography to prelude a realist evaluation, asking the question under what conditions can local health and care services take responsibility for designing and implementing new service models that meet local needs? The project had already engaged with several health care practitioners and research students based in Canada, Sweden, Australia, and the United States. Our attention is particularly on rural communities with fewer than 5,000 residents and which are relatively isolated from larger service centres. Between March and September 2020, the project team undertook ethnographic and auto-ethnographic research in their own communities to investigate what the service model responses to the pandemic were, and the extent to which local service managers were able to customize their responses to suit the needs of their communities. An initial program theory drawn from the extant literature suggested that “successful” response to the pandemic would depend on a level of local autonomy, “absorptive capacity,*” strong service-community connections, an “anti-fragile†” approach to implementing change, and a realistic recognition of the historical barriers to implementing eHealth and other innovations in these types of rural communities. The field research in 2020 has refined the theory by focusing even more attention on absorptive capacity and community connections, and by suggesting that some level of ignorance of the barriers to innovation may be beneficial. The research also emphasized the role and power of external actors to the community which had not been well-explored in the literature. This paper will summarize both what the field research revealed about the capacity to respond well to the COVID-19 challenge and highlight the gaps in innovative strategies at a managerial level required for rapid response to system stress. *Absorptive Capacity is defined as the ability of an organization (community, clinic, hospital) to adapt to change. Organizations with flexible capacity can incorporate change in a productive fashion, while those with rigid capacity take longer to adapt, and may do so inappropriately. †Antifragility is defined as an entities' ability to gain stability through stress.

We assessed the emotional health of caregivers by care-receiver condition type (i.e. mental health or addictions vs. physical or other health problems), levels of caregiver stress and methods particularly for reducing stress among caregivers of persons with mental health or addictions disorders. Weighted cross-sectional data from the 2012 General Social Survey (Caregiving and Care Receiving) were modelled using weighted descriptive and logistic regression analyses to examine levels of stress and the emotional health and well-being of caregivers by care-receiver condition type. Caregivers of persons with mental health or addictions problems were more likely to report that caregiving was very stressful and that they felt depressed, tired, worried or anxious, overwhelmed; lonely or isolated; short-tempered or irritable; and resentful because of their caregiving responsibilities. The results of this study suggest that mental health and addictions caregivers may experience disparate stressors and require varying services and supports relative to caregivers of persons with physical or other health conditions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","addictions; caregiving; family caregiving; mental health; stress and coping","Adolescent; Adult; Canada; Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Stress, Psychological; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; Canada; caregiver; cross-sectional study; drug dependence; emotion; female; human; male; mental health; mental stress; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; satisfaction; young adult","","","","","","","Aneshensel C., Theory-Based Data Analysis for the Social Sciences, (2013); Baronet A., Factors associated with caregiver burden in mental illness: a critical review of the research literature, Clinical Psychology Review, 19, 7, pp. 819-841, (1999); Beevers C., Wells T., Miller I., Predicting response to depression treatment: the role of negative cognition, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 75, 3, pp. 422-431, (2007); Biegel D., Milligan S., Putnam P., Et al., Predictors of burden among lower socioeconomic status caregivers of persons with chronic mental illness, Community Mental Health Journal, 30, 5, pp. 473-494, (1994); Biegel D., Ishler K., Katz S., Et al., Predictors of burden of family caregivers of women with substance use disorders or co-occurring substance and mental disorders, Journal of Social Work Practice in the Addictions, 7, 1-2, pp. 25-46, (2007); Bloch S., Szmukler G., Herrman H., Et al., Counseling caregivers of relatives with schizophrenia: themes, interventions, and caveats, Family Process, 34, 4, pp. 413-425, (1995); Corrigan P., Watson A., Miller F., Blame, shame, and contamination: the impact of mental illness and drug dependence stigma on family members, Journal of Family Psychology, 20, 2, pp. 239-246, (2006); Corsentino E., Molinari V., Gum A., Et al., Family caregivers’ future planning for younger and older adults with serious mental illness (SMI), Journal of Applied Gerontology, 27, 4, pp. 466-485, (2008); Doornbos M., Predicting family health in families of young adults with severe mental illness, Journal of Family Nursing, 8, 3, pp. 241-263, (2002); Caring Together: Families as Partners in the Mental Health and Addiction System, (2006); Fichter M., Glynn S., Weyerer S., Et al., Family climate and expressed emotion in the course of alcoholism, Family Process, 36, 2, pp. 203-221, (1997); Fleischman H., Klupp A., Quality of life in relatives of mentally ill people, Psychiatrische Praxis, 31, pp. S114-S116, (2004); Friedrich R., Lively S., Buckwalter K., Well siblings living with schizophrenia.

An excess lung cancer risk among welders is well established, but whether this is attributable to welding fumes is unclear. Excess risks of other cancers have been suggested, but not established. We investigated welding cancer risks in the population-based Canadian Census Health and Environmental Cohort. Methods Among 1.1 million male workers, 12,845 welders were identified using Standard Occupational Classification codes and followed through retrospective linkage of 1991 Canadian Long Form Census and Canadian Cancer Registry (1992–2010) records. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models based on estimated risks of lung cancer, mesothelioma, and nasal, brain, stomach, kidney, and bladder cancers, and ocular melanoma. Lung cancer histological subtypes and risks by industry group and for occasional welders were examined. Some analyses restricted comparisons to blue-collar workers to minimize effects of potential confounders. Results Among welders, elevated risks were observed for lung cancer [HR: 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.31], mesothelioma (HR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.01–3.18), bladder cancer (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15–1.70), and kidney cancer (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.01–1.67). When restricted to blue-collar workers, lung cancer and mesothelioma risks were attenuated, while bladder and kidney cancer risks increased. Conclusion Excess risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma may be partly attributable to factors including smoking and asbestos. Welding-specific exposures may increase bladder and kidney cancer risks, and particular sources of exposure should be investigated. Studies that are able to disentangle welding effects from smoking and asbestos exposure are needed. © 2017 The Authors","cohort studies; neoplasms; occupational diseases; occupational exposure; welding","adult; age; aged; Article; bladder cancer; blue collar worker; brain cancer; Canada; cancer risk; cohort analysis; eye melanoma; female; human; kidney cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mesothelioma; metastasis; middle aged; nose cancer; occupational cancer; primary tumor; risk assessment; small cell lung cancer; stomach cancer; welding","","","","","","","Husgafvel-Pursiainen K., Siemiatycki J., pp. 40-9, (2009); IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans.

Methods: The CanCHEC cohort linked 1991 census data to the Canadian cancer registry for follow up. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate risks for firefighter, police, or armed forces compared to workers in other occupations. Results: The cohort of 1 108 410 men included 4535 firefighters, 10 055 police, and 9165 armed forces. For firefighters, elevated risks were noted for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HR: 2.89, 95%CI: 1.29-6.46), melanoma (HR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.17-2.37), and prostate cancer (HR: 1.18, 95%CI: 1.01-1.37). Police had elevated risks for melanoma (HR:1.69, 95%CI: 1.32-2.16) and prostate cancer (HR:1.28, 95%CI: 1.14-1.42). No significant associations were found for armed forces workers. Conclusions: Canadian firefighters, police, and armed services, may be at an increased risk of developing certain cancers. Results suggested that a healthy worker effect may influence risk estimates. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","armed forces; cancer surveillance; cohort; firefighters; police","Adult; Aged; Canada; Censuses; Cohort Studies; Epidemiological Monitoring; Firefighters; Hodgkin Disease; Humans; Male; Melanoma; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Neoplasms; Police; Proportional Hazards Models; Prostatic Neoplasms; Registries; Skin Neoplasms; adult; aged; Canada; cohort analysis; epidemiological monitoring; fire fighter; Hodgkin disease; human; male; melanoma; middle aged; neoplasm; police; population research; proportional hazards model; prostate tumor; register; skin tumor; soldier; statistics and numerical data","","","","","Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Canadian Institute for Health Information; Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board Research Advisory Council, (11024); Statistics Canada, (MT); Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, WSIB; Health Canada; National Research Council for Economics, Humanities and Social Science, NRCS","Funding text 1: The study was funded by the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board Research Advisory Council (grant number 11024).

Often, rural service implementation is executed with inappropriate frameworks based on assumptions derived from urban centres. To understand the characteristics of rural communities that can facilitate successful program implementation better, ethnographic accounts of rural health and care services were compiled in rural communities within Canada, Australia, and Iceland. Ethnographic accounts are presented in the first and third person, with an accompanying reflexive analysis immediately following these accounts. Antifragility was the guiding concept of interest when investigating rural implementation environments, a concept that posits that a system can gain stability from uncertainty rather than lose integrity. These ethnographic accounts provide evidence of antifragile operators such as optionality, hybrid leadership, starting small, nonlinear evaluation, and avoiding suboptimisation. It is shown that the integration of these antifragile operators allows programs to function better in complex rural systems. Further, the presence of capable individuals with sufficient knowledge in several disciplines and with depth in a single discipline allows for innovative local thinking initiatives. © 2023 by the authors.","antifragility; electronic health; ethnography; health services; place-based health; rural health","Australia; Canada; Humans; Iceland; Rural Health Services; Rural Population; Australia; Canada; Iceland; ethnography; health services; implementation process; rural area; rural society; adult; article; Australia; Canada; ethnography; female; health service; human; human experiment; Iceland; leadership; male; rural health; rural population; thinking; uncertainty; rural health care","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (141960)","This research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada: Rural Research: Information, Statistics, and Knowledge.

Methods In the Nordic Occupational Cancer study (NOCCA), 73 653 bladder cancer cases were observed during follow-up of 141.6 million person-years. In the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC), 8170 cases were observed during the follow-up of 36.7 million person-years. Standardised incidence ratios with 95% CI were estimated for 53 occupations in the NOCCA cohort and HR with 95% CIs were estimated for 42 occupations in the CanCHEC. Results Elevated risks of bladder cancer were observed among hairdressers, printers, sales workers, plumbers, painters, miners and laundry workers. Teachers and agricultural workers had reduced risk of bladder cancer in both cohorts. Chimney-sweeps, tobacco workers and waiters had about 1.5-fold risk in the Nordic countries; no risk estimates for these categories were given from the CanCHEC cohort. Conclusion We observed different occupational patterns in risk of bladder cancer in Nordic countries and Canada. The only occupation with similarly increased risk was observed among sales workers. Differences in smoking across occupational groups may explain some, but not all, of this variation. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.","Canada;

Data and methods The 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) was used to develop age-/ sex-specific predictive models to model smoking status based on variables available on the 1991 Census. The 2002/2003 CCHS was used to validate the modelled variable. Data from the 2002/2003 CCHS linked to data from the Hospital Morbidity Database (2001/2002 to 2004/2005) were used to evaluate the use of modelled versus self-reported smoking status on smoking-related hospitalizations. Results For the current daily smoker models, income, education, marital status, dwelling ownership and region of birth were significant predictors. For the never smokermodels, marital status, dwelling ownership, Aboriginal identity and region of birth were significant predictors. Modelled current daily smoker status was associated with increased odds of smoking-related hospitalization, compared with being a never smoker, even when adjusting for covariates. Interpretation This study demonstrates the feasibility of using statistical modelling techniques to assign smoking status to census data, provided socio-economic and identity information is available. © Minister of Industry, 2013.","Health surveys; Hospitalization; Roc Curve; Socioeconomic factors; Statistical models","Canada; Censuses; Health Surveys; Humans; Risk Factors; Smoking; Canada; epidemiology; health survey; human; population research; risk factor; smoking","","","","","","","Roos L.L., Nicol J.P., Cageorge S.M., Using administrative data for longitudinal research: comparisons with primary data collection, Journal of Chronic Diseases, 40, pp. 41-49, (1987); Lezzoni L.I., Using administrative data to study persons with disabilities, The Milbank Quarterly, 80, 2, pp. 347-379, (2002); Brackstone G.J., Issues in the use of administrative records for statistical purposes, Survey Methodology, 13, pp. 29-43, (1987); Disano J., Goulet J., Muhajarine N., Et al., Social-economic status and rates of hospital admission for chronic disease in urban Canada, The Canadian Nurse, 106, 1, pp. 24-29, (2010); Booth G.L., Bisara P., Lipscombe L.L., Et al., Universal drug coverage and socioeconomic disparaties in major diabetes outcomes, Diabetes Care 2012; epub ahead of print, (2012); Wilkins R., Berthelot J.M., Ng E., Trends in mortality by neighbourhood income in urban Canada from 1971 to 1996, Health Reports, 13, pp. 1-28, (2002); Hanley G.E., Morgan S., On the validity of area-based income measures to proxy household income, BMC Health Services Research, 8, (2008); Marra C.A., Lynd L.D., Harvard S.S., Grubisic X., Agreement between aggregate and individual-level measures of income and education: a comparison across three patient groups, BMC Health Services Research, 11, (2011); Southern D.A., McLaren L., Hawe P., Et al., Individual-level and neighbourhood income measures: agreement and association with outcomes in a cardiac disease cohort, Medical Care, 43, 11, pp. 1116-1122, (2005); Pampalon R., Hamel D., Gamache P., A comparison of individual and area-based socio-economic data for monitoring social inequalities in health, Health Reports, 20, 4, pp. 85-94, (2009); Burnett R.T., Cakmak S., Brion O., Et al., An indirect adjustment method for multiple missing variables applicable to environmental epidemiology, American Journal of Epidemiology; Rotermann M., Evaluation of the coverage of linked Canadian Community Health Survey and hospital inpatient records, Health Reports, 20, 1, pp. 45-51, (2009); Wilkins K., Shields M., Rotermann M., Smokers' use of acute care hospitals: A prospective study, Health Reports, 20, 4, pp. 75-83, (2009); Sanmartin C., Khan S., Hospitalizations for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC): The Factors That Matter, Health Research Working Paper Series, (2011); Wilkins R., Tjepkema M., Mustard C., Choinirre R., The Canadian census mortality follow-up study, 1991 through 2001, Health Reports, 19, 3, pp. 25-43, (2008); Peters P.A., Tjepkema M., 1991-2011 Canadian census mortality and cancer follow-up study.

This paper examines how information systems in general, and geographic information systems (GIS) in particular, can contribute to an understanding of local educational contexts and needs through the provision of information tools that bridge national-level goals and policy to local-level action and outcomes. First, utilising the frameworks from global initiatives such as Education for All and A Framework for Action, direction is provided as to what types of data are required to evaluate education systems and education quality, especially given the absence of detailed local-level data. Second, the relationship between neighbourhood context and the quality of education is assessed. Third, the available educational and contextual information for a case study in the urban district of Independencia, Peru is described. Utilising information available at the local level and general international frameworks, a method is outlined for the analysis of education quality and neighbourhood well-being and is applied to the case of Independencia, Peru. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Development; Educational development; Educational planning; Geographic information systems","Peru; South America; educational development; GIS; neighborhood; socioeconomic conditions","","","","","Santiago de Chile; Ford Foundation","We would like to express our thanks to Martia Palacios and the Ford Foundation, Santiago de Chile, who funded the project this research is drawn from, the Peruvian Ministry of Education for supplying schools data, and also to our colleagues at the NGO Alternativa in Lima.","Buchert L., The concept of education for all: What has happened after Jomtien?, International Review of Education, 41, 6, pp. 537-549, (1995); Carlson B.A., Achieving Educational Quality: What Schools Teach Us, Learning from Chile's P900 Primary Schools, (2000); Dorling D., How much does place matter?, Environment and Planning A, 33, pp. 1335-1369, (2001); Filmer D., Pritchett L., The Effect of Household Wealth on Educational Attainment Around the World: Demographic and Health Survey Evidence, (1998); Fitz-Gibbon C., Kochan S., School effectiveness and education indicators, The International Handbook of School Effectiveness Research, (2000); Flowerdew R., Pearce J., Linking point and area data to model primary school performance indicators, Geographical and Environmental Modelling, 5, 1, pp. 23-41, (2001); Garner C.L., Raudenbush S.W., Neighbourhood effects on educational attainment: A multilevel analysis, Sociology of Education, 64, pp. 251-262, (1991); Gilleskie D.B., Harrison A.L., The effect of endogenous health inputs on the relationship between health and education, Economics of Education Review, 17, 3, pp. 287-295, (1998); Glasser W., The Quality School: Managing Students Without Coercion, (1990); Hall G.B., Conning A., Integrating demographic and socioeconomic data with PC-based GIS in Latin America, Possibilities and Constraints of GIS Applications in Developing Countries, (1991); Hallak J., Education for All: High Expectations or False Hopes?, (1991); IX Censo de Población Y IV de Vivienda, (1993); World Declaration on Education for All and Framework for Action to Meet Basic Learning Needs, (1990); Kelly A., Comparing like with like, Education, 187, 1, pp. 14-15, (1996); Maratos J., Understanding the concept of education for all: Notes on educational research methods, International Review of Education, 43, 4, pp. 375-379, (1997); Martin D., Atkinson P., Investigating the spatial linkage of primary school performance and catchment characteristics, Geographical and Environmental Modelling, 5, 1, pp. 67-83, (2001); McMahon W.W., an Efficiency-Based Management Information System, (1993); Educación Para Todos 2000 Perú: Informe Nacional De Evaluación, (2000); Ocampo J.A., (2000); Education in the Americas: Quality and Equity in the Globalization Process, (1998); Pearce J., Techniques for defining school catchment areas for comparison with census data, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 24, pp. 283-303, (2000); Raudenbush S.W., Bryk A.S., A hierarchical model for studying school effects, Sociology of Education, 59, 1, pp. 1-17, (1986); Reimers F., Educational opportunity and policy in Latin America, Unequal Schools, Unequal Chances: The Challenges to Equal Opportunity in the Americas, pp. 54-111, (2000); Rivero J., Education and poverty: Policies, strategies and challenges, Regional Summit for Political Development and Democratic Principles in Brasilia, (1998); Reynolds D., School effectiveness: The international dimension, The International Handbook of School Effectiveness Research, (2000); Reynolds D., Teddlie C., The process of school effectiveness, The International Handbook of School Effectiveness Research, (2000); Reynolds D., Teddlie C., Creemers B., Scheerens J., Townsend T., An introduction to school effectiveness research, The International Handbook of School Effectiveness Research, (2000); Schereens J., Process indicators of school functioning, The OECD International Education Indicators: A Framework for Analysis, pp. 53-76, (1992); Wasted Opportunities: When Schools Fail.

Additional population-representative human studies are needed and large population-based linkage cohorts have been explored as an option for surveillance shift work and cancer risk. This study uses a surveillance linkage cohort and job-exposure matrix to test relationships. Methods: We estimated associations between shift work and breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer using the population-based Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC), linking the 1991 Canadian census to national cancer registry and mortality databases. Prevalence estimates from population labour survey data were used to estimate and assign probability of night, rotating, or evening shifts by occupation and industry. Cohort members were assigned to high (>50%), medium (>25 to 50%), low (>5 to 25%), or no (<5%) probability of exposure categories. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate associations between shift work exposure and incidence of prostate cancer in men and ovarian and breast cancer in women. Results: The cohort included 1 098 935 men and 939 520 women. Hazard ratios (HRs) indicated null or inverse relationships comparing high probability to no exposure for prostate cancer: HR = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91-1.02; breast cancer: HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90-0.99; and ovarian cancer: HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.87-1.13. Conclusions: This study showed inverse and null associations between shift work exposure and incidence of prostate, breast, or ovarian cancer. However, we explore limitations of a surveillance cohort, including a possible healthy worker survivor effect and the possibility that this relationship may require the nuanced exposure detail in primary collection studies to be measurable.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Cancer epidemiology; Retrospective exposure assessment; Shift work; Surveillance","Breast Neoplasms; Canada; Female; Humans; Male; Occupational Exposure; Ovarian Neoplasms; Prostatic Neoplasms; Shift Work Schedule; Hazards; Monitoring; Population statistics; Probability; Surveys; Urology; Cancer registries; Circadian disruptions; Confidence interval; Health and environment; Inverse relationship; Job exposure matrix; Population based surveillance; Proportional hazards; breast tumor; Canada; complication; female; human; male; occupational exposure; ovary tumor; prostate tumor; shift schedule; Diseases","","","","","Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board Research Advisory Council, (11024); Statistics Canada; Health Canada; Canadian Institute for Health Information","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board Research Advisory Council (grant number 11024).

The data comes from an online survey of a census-balanced sample of 30,000+ U.S. residents. The findings showed that meat reducers are a larger group than suspected and that there was a statistically significant difference in dietary experiences with vegetarians reporting better experiences with their diet.

Injury is the leading cause of death for young people in Canada. For those living in the northern territories (Yukon, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories), injury represents an even greater problem, with higher rates of injury for people of all ages in northern areas compared with the rest of Canada; however, no such comparative studies have focussed specifically on non-fatal injury in youth. Objectives. To profile and examine injuries and their potential causes among youth in the northern territories as compared with other parts of Canada. Design. Cross-sectional data from the 2009/2010 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey (youth aged 11-15 years) were examined for the Canadian northern territories and the provinces (n=26,078). Individual survey records were linked to community-level data to profile injuries and then study possible determinants via multilevel regression modelling. Results. The prevalence of injury reported by youth was similar in northern populations and other parts of Canada. There were some minimal differences by injury type: northern youth experienced a greater percentage of neighbourhood (p<0.001) and fighting (p<0.02) injuries; youth in the Canadian provinces had a greater proportion of sport-related injuries (p=0.01). Among northern youth, female sex (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.94), average (RR=0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97) or above-average affluence (RR-0.84, 95% CI 0.76-0.91), not being drunk in the past 12 months (RR-0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.85), not riding an all-terrain vehicle (RR=0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.97) and not having permanent road access (RR-0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98) were protective against injury; sport participation increased risk (RR-1.45, 95% CI 1.33-1.59). Conclusions. Patterns of injury were similar across youth from the North and other parts of Canada. Given previous research, this was unexpected. When implementing injury prevention initiatives, individual and community-level risk factors are essential to understand; however, specific positive safety assets that might exist in different community contexts must also be considered. © 2015 Jessica Byrnes et al.","Aboriginal populations; Adolescent; Alcohol policy; Epidemiology; Indigenous health; Injury; Northern health; Population health","Accident Prevention; Adolescent; Age Distribution; Canada; Child; Confidence Intervals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Health Status; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Northwest Territories; Population Groups; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Sex Distribution; Wounds and Injuries; accident prevention; adolescent; age distribution; Canada; child; comparative study; confidence interval; cross-sectional study; factual database; female; health status; human; injury scale; male; multivariate analysis; Northwest Territories; population group; prevalence; procedures; risk assessment; sex ratio; statistics and numerical data; Wounds and Injuries","","","","","","","Leading Causes of Hospitalizations, (2005); Leading Causes of Death, Total Population, (2005); Chen Y., Mo F., Yi Q.L., Jiang Y., Mao Y., Unintentional injury mortality and external causes in Canada from 2001 to 2007, Chronic Dis Inj Can, 33, pp. 95-102, (2013); Pan S.Y., Desmeules M., Morrison H., Semenciw R., Ugnat A.M., Thompson W., Et al., Adolescent injury deaths and hospitalization in Canada: Magnitude and temporal trends (1979-2003), J Adolesc Health, 41, pp. 84-92, (2007); Davison C., Russel K., Piedt S., Pickett W., The CIHR Team in Child and Youth Injury Prevention.

Examining rates of diagnoses in relation to traits may yield a clearer understanding of the degree to which racial/ethnic minority youth in Canada differ in their access to care. We sought to examine differences in self/parent-reported rates of diagnoses for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders after adjusting for differences in trait levels between youth from three racial/ethnic groups: White, South Asian and East Asian. Method: We collected parent or self-reported ratings of OCD, ADHD and anxiety traits and diagnoses for 6- to 17-year-olds from a Canadian general population sample (Spit for Science). We examined racial/ethnic differences in trait levels and the odds of reporting a diagnosis using mixed-effects linear models and logistic regression models. Results: East Asian (N = 1301) and South Asian (N = 730) youth reported significantly higher levels of OCD and anxiety traits than White youth (N = 6896). East Asian and South Asian youth had significantly lower odds of reporting a diagnosis for OCD (odds ratio [OR]East Asian = 0.08 [0.02, 0.41]; ORSouth Asian= 0.05 [0.00, 0.81]), ADHD (OREast Asian = 0.27 [0.16, 0.45]; ORSouth Asian= 0.09 [0.03, 0.30]) and anxiety (OREast Asian = 0.21 [0.11, 0.39]; ORSouth Asian = 0.12 [0.05, 0.32]) than White youth after accounting for psychiatric trait levels. Conclusions: These results suggest a discrepancy between trait levels of OCD, ADHD and anxiety and rates of diagnoses for East Asian and South Asian youth. This discrepancy may be due to increased barriers for ethnically diverse youth to access mental health care. Efforts to understand and mitigate these barriers in Canada are needed. © The Author(s) 2024.","access to care; equity; ethnic and racial disparities; ethnicity; mental illness; race; spit for science","Adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; Asia, Eastern; Asian; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Canada; Child; Ethnic and Racial Minorities; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; White People; anxiety disorder; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; behavior disorder assessment; Canada; Caucasian; child; Child Behavior Checklist; childhood disease; community; East Asian; economic aspect; ethnic disparity; female; health care access; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health care; neighborhood; obsessive compulsive disorder; parent; prevalence; psychiatric diagnosis; questionnaire; racial disparity; self report; social inequality; social status; South Asian; strengths and weaknesses of attention deficit hyperactivity symptoms and normal behavior rating scale; toronto obsessive compulsive scale; urban area; adolescent; anxiety disorder; Asian; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ethnic group; ethnology; Far East; health disparity; obsessive compulsive disorder","","","","","Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Foundation, CAMH; Alberta Innovates, AI; Biohaven Pharmaceuticals; Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth, and Family; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (MOP-106573, MOP-93696)","Funding text 1: The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Andrew Dissanayake, Annie Dupuis, Christie L.

The national numbers show some general differences between countries, but hide the fact that rural areas and especially the more northern regions differ markedly from the general patterns. Foss and Juvkam pointed out that, although one of the problems causing a difficult demographic situation in Nordic peripheries has been a declining fertility rate, the major cause has been the out-migration of relatively young persons. Regional gender differences have been a characteristic of the sparsely populated regions which has existed for several decades, but has evolved further over the last 10-15 years due to the higher out-migration of women from rural areas.

The research uses case studies of three villages in Australia, Canada, and Sweden, all of which have been labeled as “declining villages,” typified by population loss, an aging population, high rates of youth outmigration, and loss of businesses and services. This paper argues that focusing solely on quantitative indicators of demographic change provides a narrow view of rural village trajectories and ignores subtle processes of local adaptation that are hidden from quantitative data sets. Our research integrates quantitative data from the “outside” with qualitative data from the “inside,” including visual ethnography, to develop a more balanced perspective on how villages have been changing and what change could mean locally. These objectives are accomplished by revisiting a Dirt Research methodology applicable to a broad range of research into rural and remote villages. © 2018 Canadian Sociological Association/La Société canadienne de sociologie","","aging; article; Australia; Canada; ethnography; juvenile; local adaptation; Sweden","","","","","","","Ahlin C.Y., Rural Demographic Change over Space and Time—The Case of Vilhelmina Municipality, (2015); Banks R., Rural Decline and Innovation: Issues within Issues, Australian Journal of Social Issues, 36, 2, pp. 169-176, (2001); Barnes T.J., Borderline Communities—Canadian Single Industry Towns, Staples, and Harold Innis, Bordering Space, pp. 109-122, (2005); Barnes T.J., Britton J.N., Coffey W.J., Edcincton D.W., Certler M.S., Norcliffe G., Canadian Economic Geography at the Millennium, Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe Canadien, 44, 1, pp. 4-24, (2000); Barnes T.J., Hayter R., Hay E., Stormy Weather: Cyclones, Harold Innis, and Port Alberni, BC, Environment and Planning A, 33, 12, pp. 2127-2147, (2001); Besser T.L., Changes in Small Town Social Capital and Civic Engagement, Journal of Rural Studies, 25, 2, pp. 185-193, (2009); Bolin O., Persson L.O., Forecasting Changes in the Agricultural Structure: Three System Simulation Models, European Review of Agricultural Economics, 4, 3, pp. 187-214, (1977); Bradbury J.H., Towards an Alternative Theory of Resource-Based Town Development in Canada, Economic Geography, 55, 2, pp. 147-166, (1979); Buikstra E., Ross H., King C.A., Baker P.G., Hegney D., McLachlan K., Rogers-Clark C., The Components of Resilience—Perceptions of an Australian Rural Community, Journal of Community Psychology, 38, 8, pp. 975-991, (2010); Carson D., Schmallegger D., Drive Tourism: A View from the Road, Drive Tourism: Trends and Emerging Markets, pp. 358-368, (2011); Carson D.A., Carson D.B., Lundmark L., Tourism and Mobilities in Sparsely Populated Areas: Towards a Framework and Research Agenda, Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism, 14, 4, pp. 353-366, (2014); Dahms H.F., From Creative Action to the Social Rationalization of the Economy: Joseph A.

The study objectives were to 1) estimate the population living close to alcohol outlets before and after liquor distribution reforms, 2) identify communities or regions that would be more or less affected, and 3) determine whether expanding access to alcohol products would reduce school proximity to retailers. METHODS: Data from Statistics Canada, Desktop Mapping Technologies Inc. (DMTI), and geocoded publicly available information were spatially linked and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The populations living within 499 m, 500-999 m and 1-5 km of an outlet were estimated, and the distances from schools to stores were examined by geographic characteristics and neighbourhood socio-economic status. RESULTS: Permitting the sale of alcohol in all grocery stores throughout the province would increase the number of liquor outlets from 153 to 282 and would increase the population residing within 499 m of an outlet by 97.49%, from 19 886 to 39 273 residents. The sale of alcohol in grocery stores would result in an additional 35 liquor sales outlets being located within 499 m of schools. Low-income neighbourhoods would have the highest number and proportion of stores within 499 m of schools. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate the importance of considering social, economic and health inequities in the context of alcohol policy reforms that will disproportionately affect low-income neighbourhoods and youth living within these areas. © 2017 Canadian Public Health Association or its licensor.","Alcohol policy; Public health; Substance abuse; Youth","Adolescent; Alcoholic Beverages; Commerce; Health Status Disparities; Humans; New Brunswick; Poverty Areas; Public Policy; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Schools; Socioeconomic Factors; Underage Drinking; Urban Population; adolescent; alcoholic beverage; commercial phenomena; demography; health disparity; human; New Brunswick; poverty; public policy; rural population; school; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; underage drinking; urban population","","","","","MSSU; Fondation de la recherche en santé du Nouveau-Brunswick, FRSNB; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR","1.

This is the first national-level cohort study to investigate these risks in Canada. Objective: We investigated the association between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and cardiovascular mortality in nonimmigrant Canadian adults. Methods: We assigned estimates of exposure to ambient PM2.5 derived from satellite observations to a cohort of 2.1 million Canadian adults who in 1991 were among the 20% of the population mandated to provide detailed census data. We identified deaths occurring between 1991 and 2001 through record linkage. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for available individual-level and contextual covariates using both standard Cox proportional survival models and nested, spatial random-effects survival models. Results: Using standard Cox models, we calculated HRs of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.16) from nonaccidental causes and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.27, 1.35) from ischemic heart disease for each 10-μg/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5. Using spatial random-effects models controlling for the same variables, we calculated HRs of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.15) and 1.30 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.43), respectively. We found similar associations between nonaccidental mortality and PM2.5 based on satellite-derived estimates and ground-based measurements in a sub-analysis of subjects in 11 cities. Conclusions: In this large national cohort of nonimmigrant Canadians, mortality was associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5. Associations were observed with exposures to PM2.5 at concentrations that were predominantly lower (mean, 8.7 μg/m3; interquartile range, 6.2 μg/m3) than those reported previously.","Canada; Cardiovascular mortality; Cohort study; Fine particulate matter","adult; aged; article; Canada; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; cohort analysis; death; female; human; immigrant; ischemic heart disease; long term exposure; male; mathematical model; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal","","","","","","","Ali J.S., McDermott S., Gravel R.G., Recent research on immigrant health from Statistics Canada's population surveys, Can J Public Health, 95, 3, (2004); Beelen R., Hoek G., van den Brandt P.A., Goldbohm R.A., Fischer P., Schouten L.J., Et al., Long-term effects of traffic-related air pollution on mortality in a Dutch cohort (NLCS-AIR study), Environ Health Perspect, 116, pp. 196-202, (2008); Chen H., Goldberg M.S., Villeneuve P.J., A systematic review of the relation between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and chronic diseases, Rev Environ Health, 23, 4, pp. 243-297, (2008); Chen L.H., Knutsen S.F., Shavlik D., Beeson W.L., Petersen F., Ghamsary M., Et al., The association between fatal coronary heart disease and ambient particulate air pollution: Are females at greater risk?, Environ Health Perspect, 113, pp. 1723-1729, (2005); Cooke R.M., Wilson A.M., Tuomisto J.T., Morales O., Tainio M., Evans J.S., A probabilistic characterization of the relationship between fine particulate matter and mortality: Elicitation of European experts, Environ Sci Technol, 41, 18, pp. 6598-6605, (2007); Crouse D.L., Ross N.A., Goldberg M.S., Double burden of deprivation and high concentrations of ambient air pollution at the neighbourhood scale in Montreal, Soc Sci Med, 69, 6, pp. 971-981, (2009); Dockery D.W., Pope III.

Our study uses one of the largest Canadian worker cohorts to examine occupation, industry, and prostate cancer and to assess patterns of prostate cancer rates. The Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) was established by linking the 1991 Canadian Census Cohort to the Canadian Cancer Database (1969–2010), Canadian Mortality Database (1991–2011), and Tax Summary Files (1981–2011). A total of 37,695 prostate cancer cases were identified in men aged 25–74 based on age at diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals. In men aged 25–74 years, elevated risks were observed in the following occupations: senior management (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04–1.20); office and administration (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11–1.27); finance services (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04–1.14); education (HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00–1.11); agriculture and farm management (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.06–1.17); farm work (HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01–1.21); construction managers (HR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01–1.14); firefighting (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01–1.36); and police work (HR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.09–1.36). Decreased risks were observed across other construction and transportation occupations. Results by industry were consistent with occupation results. Associations were identified for white-collar, agriculture, protective services, construction, and transportation occupations.
