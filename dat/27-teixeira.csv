This ‘suburbanization of immigrants’ is significantly affecting the housing situation in the Vancouver area, as the market responds to the preferences and requirements of new immigrant groups. This paper draws from a case study examining the settlement and housing experiences of recent immigrants from Mexico living in three Vancouver suburbs (Burnaby, Surrey, and Abbotsford). The findings from our survey of 129 Mexican immigrants and interviews with 60 key stakeholders reveal that housing affordability is a major issue for Mexican immigrant homeowners and renters. Almost half of the survey respondents spent more than 30% of their monthly income on housing. Renters used various strategies to afford housing, including sharing housing with relatives and co-ethnic friends (sometimes in overcrowded conditions), while some homeowners sublet rooms or rented out basement suites. The findings also revealed that in addition to facing employment and housing market challenges similar to other immigrant groups in Vancouver, Mexican immigrants experienced housing discrimination related to suspicions about undocumented immigration. Despite facing barriers to integration, the Mexican immigrants in our study were largely successful in improving their housing status in Canada. Policymakers and service planners must understand the ‘ethnic refashioning’ of major city suburbs and the housing issues faced by new groups of immigrants to better assist their integration. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Canada; Ethnic networks; Housing; Mexican immigrants; Settlement experiences; Suburbanization; Vancouver","Abbotsford; British Columbia; Canada; Mexico [North America]; Surrey [England]; Vancouver [British Columbia]; Commerce; Facings; Surveys; Housing affordability; Housing markets; Major cities; Me-xico; Policy makers; employment; ethnic group; housing market; illegal immigrant; immigrant; spatiotemporal analysis; suburban area; Housing","","","","","Department of Community, Culture and Global Studies; Mexican Consulate in Vancouver; National Council of Science and Technology; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","Funding text 1: The authors would like to express their appreciation to the immigrants and the key informants that participated in this study, as well as the Mexican Consulate in Vancouver and each of the organizations in Burnaby, Surrey and Abbotsford that offered advice and help in recruiting immigrants.

In recent decades, however, changes in the immigration policies of both countries have resulted in more heterogeneous immigrant flows than ever before. These new waves of immigration have transformed the demography, as well as social, economic, and political structures of North American urban and suburban areas. Given the importance of immigration as an engine of social and political change as well as economic development, it is imperative that scholarship addresses these new realities in our metropolitan areas.

The evidence indicates that these immigrants were 'pulled' into relocating to Mississauga because of their desire to live in a single-family dwelling in a good neighbourhood. Their housing search relied extensively on ethnic sources of information, particularly Portuguese real estate agents. In general, this group of immigrants expressed satisfaction with their move. The Portuguese community in Mississauga is characterized by a form of voluntary segregation, which seems to be partly a result of their reliance on their own ethnic community for information, language barriers to participating in non-Portuguese activities, and a cultural preference for living near people of the same ethnic background. One consequence of this re-segregation process, by which Portuguese people recreate a Portuguese 'homeland' in the suburbs, has been the limitation of their social contacts with members of other ethnic communities that have also settled in suburban Mississauga.","Enclaves; Housing; Portuguese; Suburbanization","Canada; Mississauga; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; ethnic group; European immigrant; immigrant population; suburbanization; urban housing","","","","","Centre for Urban and Community Studies, University of Toronto","The author wishes to acknowledge the helpful comments and criticism on an earlier version of this paper by Robert A.

Not only have the source countries of immigrants to Canada and its largest city, Toronto, changed from predominantly West European to a greater proportion of immigrants from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and South America, but also recent immigrants tend to come from a wider spectrum of socio-economic backgrounds (Bourne and Rose 2001; Murdie and Teixeira 2003). The Black community of Toronto reflects the immigrant heterogeneity of Canada. While the mass media routinely portrays the Black community as a singular group, it is actually a very diverse population and includes Black Canadians, Black Americans, Black South Americans, Black Africans, and Blacks from the Caribbean (Opoku-Dapaah 2006). Immigration has contributed to the growth of this population in recent years, with about half of Canada's Black population (52 percent) consisting of immigrants, most of whom have arrived since the early 1980s (Mensah 2005). Statistics Canada records Canada's 2001 Black population at 622,210, making it the third-largest visible minority group in the country, after Chinese and South Asians. Most of Canada's Black population have settled in one of the two largest urban centers, with 46.8 percent living in Toronto and 21 percent in Montreal. © 2010 State University of New York.

We draw on data from a survey of 30 low income single mothers and semi-structured interviews with 11 key informants to elaborate on the numerous barriers that some single mothers face in this rental housing market. Of these, the most cited issues are affordability, finding housing that is adequate in size, and discrimination. The single mothers' coping strategies reflect difficult trade-offs, typically sacrificing sleeping space and privacy for safety, convenient location, and play space. Both the survey respondents and key informants called on senior governments to fund more affordable housing; and remedies such as centralised housing services and government partnerships are discussed.

This study evaluates the negative and positive effects of gentrification on the Portuguese in west central Toronto. Details concerning the settlement patterns of the Portuguese, the characteristics of Portuguese residents and patterns of gentrification in inner-city Toronto were obtained from census data. Evaluations of neighbourhood change and attitudes of the residents towards gentrification were obtained from key informant and focus group interviews. The results suggest considerable ambivalence among the respondents, but most agreed that the long-term viability of Little Portugal as an immigrant reception area with a good supply of low-cost housing is in doubt. © 2011 Urban Studies Journal Limited.","","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Portugal; Toronto; ethnic group; gentrification; immigrant population; neighborhood; resident population","","","","","","","Anisef P., Lanphier M., The World in a City, (2005); Atkinson R., Measuring gentrification and displacement in Greater London, Urban Studies, 37, 1, pp. 149-165, (2000); Atkinson R., The evidence on the impact of gentrification: new lessons for the urban renaissance?, European Journal of Housing Policy, 4, 1, pp. 107-131, (2004); Betancur J., The politics of gentrification: the case of West Town in Chicago, Urban Affairs Review, 37, 6, pp. 780-814, (2002); Boyd M., The downside of racial uplift: the meaning of gentrification in an African American neighborhood, City & Society, 17, 2, pp. 265-288, (2005); Caulfield J., City Form and Everyday Life: Toronto's Gentrification and Critical Social Practice, (1994); Curran W., Gentrification and the nature of work: exploring the links in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Environment and Planning A, 36, 7, pp. 1243-1258, (2004); Filion P., The gentrification-social structure dialectic: a Toronto case study, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 15, 4, pp. 553-574, (1991); Freeman L., There Goes the 'Hood: Views of Gentrification from the Ground Up, (2006); Germain A., Rose D., MontrÃ©al: The Quest for a Metropolis, (2000); Glass R., Introduction: Aspects of Change, (1964); Hackworth J., Rekers J., Ethnic packaging and gentrification: the case of four neighbourhoods in Toronto, Urban Affairs Review, 41, 2, pp. 211-236, (2005); Hulchanski J.D., A tale of two Canadas: homeowners and renters, Finding Room: Policy Options for a Canadian Rental Housing Strategy, pp. 81-88, (2004); Krase J., Poland and Polonia: migration, and the re-incorporation of ethnic aesthetic practice in the taste of luxury, Gentrification in a Global Context: The New Urban Colonialism, pp. 185-208, (2005); Lees L., A reappraisal of gentrification: towards a 'geography' of gentrification, Progress in Human Geography, 24, 3, pp. 389-408, (2000); Lees L., Afterword, Environment and Planning A, 39, 1, pp. 228-234, (2007); Lees L., Gentrification and social mixing: towards an inclusive urban renaissance?, Urban Studies, 45, 12, pp. 2449-2470, (2008); Lees L., Slater T., Wyly E., Gentrification, (2007); Ley D., The New Middle Class and the Re-Making of the Central City, (1996); Marcuse P., Abandonment, gentrification, and displacement: the linkages in New York City, Gentrification of the City, pp. 153-177, (1986); Meligrana J., Skaburskis A., Extent, location and profiles of continuing gentrification in Canadian metropolitan areas, 1981-2001, Urban Studies, 42, 9, pp. 1569-1592, (2005); Moore K.S., Gentrification in black face?

Approximately half a million Latin Americans currently live in Canada. They tend to prefer urban areas and settle in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. In the past, smaller and mid-sized cities in the interior of British Columbia were generally off the radar for immigrants, but this has changed since the early 2000s, and the city of Kelowna has gradually emerged as a popular destination, including for immigrants from Latin America. It is a growing population that has received relatively little scholarly attention. This article addresses this research gap by exploring the settlement and housing experiences of Latin American immigrants in the mid-sized city of Kelowna. The study draws on data from questionnaire surveys that were administered to 62 Latin American immigrants in the city of Kelowna in the summer-fall of 2018. The findings revealed that transitioning from their homelands was a stressful and costly experience for participants, particularly with regard to finding affordable housing. They reported enormous financial stress, with most living in unaffordable housing; more than half were spending more than 30% of their monthly income on housing. Participants’ residential mobility and housing searches were constrained in part by low vacancy rates, language barriers, lack of public transportation, and a lack of affordable housing to rent or buy. Immigrants’ unfamiliarity with how subsidized housing works in Canada, including how to access it, combined with a limited supply of this housing, are major challenges. © 2022 Instituto de Geografia.

Using a mixed methods approach, this study compares the experiences of immigrant and non-immigrant entrepreneurs in a mid-sized Canadian city, Kelowna, British Columbia. A survey reveals different experiences between these two groups, with immigrants facing more challenges. In the absence of institutionally complete communities or strong ethnic economies, immigrants do not rely extensively on their own community resources, an element considered instrumental for immigrant business development in large cities. Compared to non-immigrants, immigrant entrepreneurs have a more optimistic outlook on doing business in Kelowna; this is encouraging for a city trying hard to attract immigrant investment. Key informants recommended transforming the city into a more welcoming community, establishing appropriate support infrastructure, and removing potential institutional offsets. This paper adds new theoretical insights to the literature on immigrant entrepreneurship; all socio-cultural, political-institutional, and economic-structural considerations are embedded in geography. The findings also have implications for growth strategies in small- and medium-sized cities. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","British Columbia; Canada; Kelowna; business; economic development; economic growth; entrepreneur; immigrant; strategic approach","","","","","","","Auster E., Aldrich H., Small business vulnerability, ethnic enclaves and ethnic enterprise, Ethnic communities in business: Strategies for economic survival, pp. 39-54, (1984); Bahbahani K., The changing face of Kelowna: Report on ethnicity and ethnic relations, (2008); Bauder H., Explaining attitudes towards self-employment among immigrants: A Canadian case study, International Migration, 46, pp. 109-133, (2008); Profile of immigrants in BC communities 2006-Kelowna, (2013); 2011 Population Highlights Quarterly Report, (2011); Bernard A., Immigrants in the hinterlands, (2008); Boissevain J., Blaschke J., Grotenberg H., Ethnic entrepreneurs and ethnic strategies, Ethnic entrepreneurs, pp. 131-156, (1990); Bonacich E., Modell J., The economic basis of ethnic solidarity: Small business in the Japanese American community, (1980); Brenner G., Menzies T., Dionne L., Filion L., How location and ethnicity affect ethnic entrepreneurs in three Canadian cities, Thunderbird International Business Review, 52, pp. 153-171, (2010); Chan J.B., Cheung Y., Ethnic resources and business enterprise: A study of Chinese businesses in Toronto, Human Organization, 44, pp. 142-154, (1985); Clark K., Drinkwater S., Recent trends in minority ethnic entrepreneurship in Britain, International Small Business Journal, 28, pp. 136-146, (2010); Collins J., Chinese entrepreneurs, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research, 8, pp. 113-133, (2002); Collins J., Low A., Asian female immigrant entrepreneurs in small and medium-sized businesses in Australia, Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 22, 1, pp. 97-111, (2010); 2008 Economic Profile, (2008); City of Kelowna 2009 Demographic Profile, (2009); (2011); Dalziel M., Immigrants as extraordinarily successful entrepreneurs: A pilot study of the Canadian experience, Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 21, pp. 23-37, (2008); Deakens D., Ishag M., Smallbone D., Whittam G., Wyper J., Ethnic minority businesses in Scotland and the role of social capital, International Small Business Journal, 25, pp. 307-324, (2007); DelCampo R., Jacobson K., Van Buren H., Blancero D., Comparing immigrant and US born Hispanic business professionals: Insights on discrimination.

Two of its important characteristics have been its 'urban' character and the non-European origins of immigrants since the 1960s. The Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) has been a major destination for those immigrants who have entered the self-employed sector of the economy in ever-larger numbers. The authors focus on the barriers and challenges experienced by the Polish, Portuguese, Caribbean, Korean, and Somali immigrants in the establishment and operation of their businesses in the Toronto CMA. With information collected through key-informant interviews, a questionnaire survey, and focus groups, it is found that, despite the Canadian commitment to multiculturalism at all levels of government, visible-minority entrepreneurs still confront more barriers in their business practice than do non-visible-minority entrepreneurs, with access to financing being a persistent problem. Given the increasingly multicultural nature of major Canadian cities and the acknowledged role of immigrants as an engine of economic growth, the authors identify barriers to entrepreneurship among immigrants as an area of clear concern both for policymakers and for scholars, and suggest solutions to address this concern.","","Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; census; economic growth; entrepreneur; immigrant; immigration; multiculturalism; questionnaire survey; social policy","","","","","","","Auster E., Aldrich H., Small business vulnerability, ethnic enclaves and ethnic enterprise, Ethnic Communities in Business: Strategies for Economic Survival, pp. 39-54, (1984); Barrett G., Overcoming the obstacle?

The study draws on data from seven focus groups with 88 recent immigrant renters and interviews with 15 key stakeholders, conducted in Vancouver, Richmond, and Surrey in 2010. The evidence indicates that these newly arrived immigrants face numerous difficulties in the rental housing market, such as high rents, overcrowding, and poor-quality housing. Most of these immigrants were spending more than half of their monthly household income on housing, putting them at risk of homelessness. The study's findings suggest that the housing crisis affecting Surrey and Richmond - due to a limited supply of affordable rental housing and high housing costs - makes these two cities challenging regions of Vancouver for newcomers to settle in. © 2013 Canadian Association of Geographers.","banlieues;

Attention is focused on the extent to which Portuguese homebuyers rely upon real estate agents from the same ethnic background and how this source can influence the homebuyer's housing search and ultimate choice of a residence. Data were obtained from a questionnaire survey that was administered to a sample of 110 Portuguese and 90 Canadian-born recent homebuyers in the city of Mississauga, a western suburb of Toronto. All were nonresidents of Mississauga at the time of purchasing the house. The evidence indicates that Portuguese homebuyers differ significantly from the Canadian-born in their housing search by relying more extensively on ethnic sources of information, particularly real estate agents from the same ethnic background. However, almost equal numbers of Portuguese purchased houses in Portuguese and non-Portuguese neighborhoods in Mississauga. In this respect, the evidence suggests that Portuguese realtors play a more limited role in reinforcing existing spatial patterns of Portuguese settlement in Mississauga. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The Housing and Economic Experiences of Immigrants in U.S. and Canadian Cities is a collection of essays examining how recent immigrants have fared in getting access to jobs and housing in urban centres across the continent. Using a variety of methodologies, contributors from both countries present original research on a range of issues connected to housing and economic experiences. They offer both a broad overview and a series of detailed case studies that highlight the experiences of particular communities. This volume demonstrates that, while the United States and Canada have much in common when it comes to urban development, there are important structural and historical differences between the immigrant experiences in these two countries. © University of Toronto Press 2015.","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Toronto Press","","","","","","","978-144262289-0; 978-144262838-0","","","English","The Hous. and Economic Experiences of Immigrants in U.S. and Canadian Cities","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84967639056"

Housing is critical to the resettlement and integration of all immigrants. Recent immigrants, especially renters, face challenges in their settlement and housing experiences, including limited financial resources, language barriers, and rental-housing discrimination based on ethnicity or race, and yet relatively little is known about these experiences and the barriers they encounter in mid-sized cities. This paper explores the settlement and housing experiences of recent immigrants in the city of Kelowna, a mid-sized city in the interior of British Columbia (Canada) with a focus on the rental housing market. The study draws on data from questionnaire surveys administered in 2015 and 2018 with a total of 67 recent immigrant respondents. The findings reveal that immigrant newcomers experienced financial stress and significant challenges in locating affordable rental housing due to high housing costs, low vacancy rates, lack of reliable information, language barriers, and discrimination by landlords based on immigrants’ ethnic and racial background. Immigrants are increasingly redefining the social and cultural geography of mid-sized Canadian cities, and there is a need to ensure that they are able to access affordable, adequate, and suitable housing, and ultimately settle into society. This is particularly crucial given the rising cost of living in Canada, the projected increase in immigrant levels for 2023-25, and the importance of immigrant settlement in a post-pandemic context. © 2024, Canadian Ethnic Studies Association.

This article asks if geography matters in theories on immigrant entrepreneurship, and to what extent immigrant entrepreneurs in SMCs are embedded in social relations. A case study conducted in a medium-sized Canadian city finds that immigrant entrepreneurship in SMCs is characterised by a low degree of social embeddedness, and immigrant entrepreneurs are more satisfied with their accomplishment and optimistic about their business future than their non-immigrant counterparts. It raises questions about the general applicability of current theories that ignore the role of geography in affecting the social, economic and institutional contexts of the place where immigrants conduct their economic endeavours, and suggests how SMCs can attract and retain immigrant businesses. © 2015 SAGE Publications.","Canada; embeddedness; Immigrant entrepreneurship; small- and medium-sized cities","","","","","","Metropolis British Columbia","The authors thank Metropolis British Columbia for financial support and the reviewers for their comments.","Bahbahani K., The changing face of Kelowna: Report on ethnicity and ethnic relations, (2008); Bauder H., Explaining attitudes towards self-employment among immigrants: A Canadian case study, International Migration, 46, 2, pp. 109-133, (2008); Bernard A., Immigrants in the hinterlands, (2008); Boissevain J., Blaschke J., Grotenberg H., Ethnic entrepreneurs and ethnic strategies, Ethnic Entrepreneurs, (1990); Brenner G.A., Menzies T.V., Dionne L., Filion L.J., How location and ethnicity affect ethnic entrepreneurs in three Canadian cities, Thunderbird International Business Review, 52, 2, pp. 153-171, (2010); 2011 Strategic Plan, (2011); Chan J.B., Cheung Y., Ethnic resources and business enterprise: A study of Chinese businesses in Toronto, Human Organization, 44, 2, pp. 142-154, (1985); Clark K., Drinkwater S., Recent trends in minority ethnic entrepreneurship in Britain, International Small Business Journal, 28, 2, pp. 136-146, (2010); Collins J., Low A., Asian female immigrant entrepreneurs in small and medium-sized businesses in Australia, Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 22, 1, pp. 97-11, (2010); Dalziel M., Immigrants as extraordinarily successful entrepreneurs: A pilot study of the Canadian experience, Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 21, 1, pp. 23-37, (2008); Deakens D., Ishag M., Smallbone D., Whittam G., Wyper J., Ethnic minority businesses in Scotland and the role of social capital, International Small Business Journal, 25, 3, pp. 307-324, (2007); Del Campo R.G., Jacobson K.J.L., Van Buren H.J., Blancero D.M., Comparing immigrant and US born Hispanic business professionals: Insights on discrimination, Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal, 18, 3, pp. 327-350, (2011); Dhaliwal S., Silent contributors: Asian female entrepreneurs and women in business, Women’s Studies International Forum, 21, 5, pp. 463-474, (1998); Edmonston B., Interprovincial migration of Canadian immigrants, RIIM Working Paper Series, pp. 02-10, (2002); Frideres J.S., Our diverse cities, (2006); Florida R., Cities and the creative class, (2004); Galbraith C.S., Rodriguez C.L., Stiles C.L., Social capital as a club good: the case of ethnic communities and entrepreneurship, Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy, 1, 1, pp. 38-53, (2007); Getz D., Brown G., Benchmarking wine tourism development: The case of the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, Canada, International Journal of Wine Marketing, 18, 2, pp. 78-97, (2006); Hiebert D., Jewish Immigrants and the garment industry of Toronto, 1901–1931: A study of ethnic and class relations, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 83, 2, pp. 243-271, (1993); Hiebert D., The spatial limits of entrepreneurship: Business immigrants in Canada, Tijdschriftvoor Economische en Sociale Geografie, 93, 2, pp. 173-190, (2002); Hiebert D., Big potential, small reward?

While this has long been a concern in Canadian cities, such as Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal, it is also increasingly an issue in growing mid-sized cities such as Kelowna, in the interior of British Columbia. While Kelowna's real estate market is one of the most expensive in the country, there is little published data or literature on the housing experiences of immigrants in the city. This study examines the housing experiences and stresses of a small group of immigrants in Kelowna's rental housing market. This study uses data from five focus groups with 34 new immigrants and 20 interviews with key informants, conducted in Kelowna in summer 2008. The evidence indicates that for this group of immigrant newcomers, the housing search process in Kelowna's rental housing market met with significant barriers in locating affordable rental housing. Of these barriers, the most commonly cited were: (a) high housing costs; (b) lack of reliable housing information, including lack of access to organizations that provide housing help (government or not); and (c) prejudice by landlords based on the immigrants' ethnic and racial background. This study points to the need for more comparative studies on the housing experiences of immigrants in mid-sized cities in Canada to better understand which groups of immigrants are more successful than others in finding affordable housing in these mid-sized cities, and why. © / Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association canadienne des géographes.","British Columbia; Housing barriers; Housing search; Immigrants; Kelowna; Rental housing market","British Columbia; Canada; Kelowna; North America; affordable housing; comparative study; coping strategy; housing conditions; housing management; housing market; immigrant; rental sector; settlement pattern; urban growth","","","","","","","Aguiar L., Tomic P., Tumper R., Work hard, play hard: Selling kelowna, b.c., as year round, The Canadian Geographer, 49, 2, pp. 123-139, (2005); Bahbahani K., The Changing Face of Kelowna: Report on Ethnicity and Ethnic Relations, (2008); Profile of Immigrants in BC Communities 2006-Kelowna, (2006); Housing Affordability in British Columbia, (2008); Carter T., Morrish M., Amoyaw B., Attracting immigrants to smaller urban and rural communities: Lessonsl learned from the manitoba provincial nominee, Journal of International Migration and Integration, 9, 2, pp. 161-183, (2008); Report from the City of Kelowna Afford-able and Special Needs Housing Task Force, (2006); City of Kelowna-Home Sales Analysis, (2007); Kelowna-recent cma-existingimmigrants, HomeThus Marketcaution Remain Strong, (2007); Rental Market Report-Kelowna CMA, (2008); Danso R.K., Grant M.R., Access to Housing As An Adaptive Strategy for Immigrant Groups: Africans in Canadian Ethnic Studies, 32, 3, pp. 19-43, (2000); Darden J., The Significance of White Supremacy in the Canadian Metropolis of Toronto, (2004); D'Addario S., Hiebert D., Sherrell K., Access: The Role of Social Capital in Mitigating Absolute Homeless-ness among Immigrants and Refugees in the Refuge, 24, 1, pp. 107-115, (2007); Derwing T.M., Krahn K., Attracting and retaining immigrants outside the metropolis: Is the pie too small for everyone to have a piece?

Over the last four decades, they have constructed a thriving, complex community, setting up organizations, businesses and communication-information services in their own language. The purpose of this paper is to examine the Portuguese real estate industry in Toronto. The study will be focused on community resources such as networks of kinship/friendship and community ties, and how these resources contribute to the formation, maintenance, and success of Portuguese-owned real estate businesses. Data were obtained primarily from a questionnaire survey that was administered to Portuguese brokers (owners of real estate agencies) who were members of the Toronto Real Estate Board. Data collected from the questionnaire survey indicate that Portuguese real estate brokers rely to a large degree on their own community ('ethnic') resources - Portuguese friends, the media, and relatives - in starting and/or operating their current businesses. Within this context, Portuguese friends occupy a central role as an important source in providing business contacts. Real estate agencies owned by Portuguese brokers are community oriented. Portuguese customers, business location within/near to the community, and a good reputation with Portuguese clients and the community were noted by Portuguese brokers as the major factors contributing to the economic success of their businesses. Although relatively little research has been conducted in Canada on ethnic entrepreneurship, we can speculate that the main characteristic of the Portuguese real estate business - a heavy reliance on 'community resources' in serving a geographically segregated co-ethnic market - is common among Southern Mediterranean immigrant groups in Canada. Further comparative studies in this area would enhance our understanding of the complexities of ethnic entrepreneurship.","Community resources; Ethnic entrepreneurship; Portuguese; Real estate industry","Canada; Ontario; Toronto; cultural influence; entrepreneur; ethnicity; service sector","","","","","","","Aldrich H., Zimmer C., McEvoy D., Continuities in the study of ecological succession: Asian businesses in three English cities, Social Forces, 67, pp. 920-944, (1989); Anderson G.M., Higgs D., A Future to Inherit: The Portuguese Communities of Canada, (1976); Auster E., Aldrich H., Small business vulnerability, ethnic enclaves and ethnic enterprise, Ethnic Communities in Business: Strategies for Economic Survival, pp. 39-54, (1984); Balakrishnan T.R., Hou F., The Changing Patterns of Spatial Concentration and Residential Segregation of Ethnic Groups in Canada's Major Metropolitan Areas 1981-1991, (1995); Barresi C.M., The Role of the real estate agent in residential location, Sociological Focus, 1, pp. 59-71, (1968); Barrett G., Jones T.P., McEvoy D., Ethnic minority business: Theoretical discourse in Britain and North America, Urban Studies, 33, pp. 783-809, (1996); Boissevain I., Et al., Ethnic entrepreneurs and ethnic strategies, Ethnic Entrepreneurs: Immigrant Business in Industrial Societies, pp. 131-156, (1990); Bonacich E., The other side of ethnic entrepreneurship: A dialogue with Waldinger, Aldrich, Ward and Associates' International Migration Review, 27, pp. 685-692, (1993); Bonacich E., Modell J., The Economic Basis of Ethnic Solidarity: Small Business in the Japanese American Community, (1980); Bordessa R., Real estate salesmen and residential relocation decisions, The Canadian Geographer, 22, pp. 334-339, (1978); Bourne L.S., Urban Growth and Population Redistribution in North America: A Diverse and Unequal Landscape, (1995); Breton R., Institutional completeness of ethnic communities and the personal relations of immigrants, American Journal of Sociology, 70, pp. 193-205, (1964); Breton R., Et al., Ethnic Identity and Equality: Varieties of Experience in a Canadian City, (1990); Brettel C.B., Ethnicity and entrepreneurs: Portuguese Immigrants in a Canadian city, Ethnic Encounters: Identities and Contexts, pp. 169-180, (1977); Butler J.S., Entrepreneurship and Self-Help Among Black Americans, (1991); Multiculturalism and Citizenship Canada 1993 Multiculturalism Means Business 1993, (1993); Chan K.B., Ethnic resources, opportunity structure and coping strategies: Chinese business in Canda, Revue Européens des Migrations Internationales, 8, pp. 117-136, (1992); Chin K.S., Yoon I.J., Smith D., Immigrant small business and international economic linkage: A case of the Korean wig business in Los Angeles, 1968-1977, International Migration Review, 30, pp. 485-510, (1996); Dakan W., Ethnic segregation and concentration in Canadian cities, Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers, (1998); Gardner A., The Self-Employed, (1994); Helly D., Ledoyen A., Immigrés et Création D'Entreprises: Montréal 1990, (1994); Henry F., A Survey of Black Business in Metro Toronto, (1993); Hiebert D., Jewish immigrants and the garment industry of Toronto, 1901-1931: A study of ethnic and class relations, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 83, pp. 243-271, (1993); Hodge M., Feagin J.R., African American entrepreneurship and racial discrimination, The Bubbling Cauldron: Race, Ethnicity, and the Urban Crisis, pp. 99-120, (1995); Jones T.P., McEvoy D., Resources ethniques et égalités des chances: Les entreprises indo-pakistanaises en Grande-Bretagne et au Canada, Revue Européene des Migrations Internationales, 8, pp. 107-126, (1992); Juteau D., Daviau-Guay J., Moallem M., L'entrepreneurship à montréal: Première esquisse, Cahiers Québécois de Démographie, 21, pp. 119-145, (1992); Juteau D., Pare S., L'entrepreneurship à côte-des neiges: Le périmètre Victoria / Van Horne, Le Quartier Côte-des-Neiges à Montréal: Les Interfaces de la Pluriethnicité, pp. 129-160, (1997); Lavigne G., Les Ethniques, et la Ville, (1987); Li P., Chinese investment and business in Canada: Ethnic entrepreneurship reconsidered, Pacific Affairs, 66, pp. 219-243, (1993); Light I., Ethnic Enterprise in America: Business and Welfare Among Chinese, Japanese, and Blacks, (1972); Light I., Bhachu P., Karageorgis S., Migration networks and immigrant entrepreneurship, Immigration and Entrepreneurship: Culture, Capital, and Ethnic Networks, pp. 25-49, (1993); Light I., Rosenstein C., Race, Ethnicity and Entrepreneurship in Urban America, (1995); Portes A., Expanding the interaction theory of entrepreneurship, The Economic Sociology of Immigration: Essays on Networks, Ethnicity, and Entrepreneurship, pp. 166-212, (1995); Ma A., Fong E., Racism and Chinese-Canadian Business Participation, (1996); Ma Mung E., Guillon M., Les commerçants étranger?

It is also one of the most expensive housing markets in Canada. This study examines the housing experiences of three relatively recent, Portuguese-speaking African immigrant groups - the Angolans, the Mozambicans, and the Cape Verdeans - in Toronto's rental market, by examining their settlement experiences and housing search processes, as well as the outcomes of those searches. The evidence indicates that most respondents experienced discrimination by landlords in their housing search (this was less of a problem for the Cape Verdeans, who have a lighter skin colour). Both Angolans and Mozambicans encountered significant barriers in locating and securing affordable housing in a suitable neighbourhood. The study also examines their relations with the established white Portuguese community. Clearly, race (the colour of one's skin) still matters in Toronto's rental housing market. Racism - whether real or perceived - can result in social exclusion and housing segregation of immigrant groups in low-income neighbourhoods, and thus a slower integration of newcomers into Canadian society. This study points to the need for more comparative studies on visible and non-visible minorities, including newcomers from Africa (whether English-, French-, Spanish-, or Portuguese-speaking), to understand why certain groups are more successful than others in finding affordable housing in a neighbourhood of their choice. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","""Black"" Africans; Discrimination; Housing searches; Immigrants; Rental housing market; Toronto","Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; affordable housing; African immigrant; black population; housing conditions; housing market; neighborhood; refugee; rental sector; settlement pattern; urban area","","","","","Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation","Acknowledgements Financial support for this study was provided by CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation).

This study examines the housing experiences of immigrants in Vernon, Penticton, and Kelowna, using data from focus groups of new immigrants and interviews with key informants. Respondents encountered discrimination based on country of origin, immigration status, and ethnicity or race, as well as housing affordability problems. Participants cope with the latter barrier by either sharing housing to save money or renting a basement. Key informants suggest that government, especially the federal government, must help address the immigrant housing crisis in Central Okanagan by funding affordable housing construction, regulating and cooperating with developers, facilitating dialog between landlords and renters, and supporting community organizations. Municipal governments lack the resources and the constitutional powers to deal with this issue on their own. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Affordable housing; Discrimination; Immigration; Refugees","Okanagan Highlands; affordable housing; immigrant population; immigration policy; international migration; refugee","","","","","Metropolis British Columbia","Acknowledgments The author gratefully acknowledges support from Metropolis British Columbia.

The Portuguese have been an established immigrant group in Toronto and Montreal since the early 1950s, and demonstrate both high levels of homeownership and a high tendency towards suburbanization. The Portuguese group is also remarkable for their high levels of segregation within the boundaries of the cities of Toronto and Montreal. This longitudinal study relies on data that were first obtained from questionnaire surveys administered to Portuguese residents living in the city of Montreal in 1984, and to residents who left the city of Toronto and moved to Mississauga, a western suburb of Toronto, in 1990; these respondents having been re-interviewed in 2003. Findings suggest that ""pull"" rather than ""push"" factors are primarily responsible for their suburbanization. The Portuguese group in both Mississauga and Laval are also characterized by a form of ""voluntary"" self-segregation, which seems to be partially a result of their heavy reliance on ""ethnic"" (community) sources of information - in particular Portuguese real estate agents - who play a critical role in this resegregation process.","Homeownership;

Based on a survey of Polish and Somali entrepreneurs arriving at Canada since 1981, the study finds that in comparison, the more recent Somali group relies much more heavily on community resources to start and sustain their businesses, and they face more economic barriers in the process of building their own ethnic economy.

This has led to a growth in cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity in the suburbs reflecting global migration patterns. In Vancouver, Canada, the growing “suburbanization” of immigrants is shaping social, cultural, economic, and political landscapes in these areas. Through interviews with 60 key informants, we explore the settlement of Mexican immigrants in Burnaby, Surrey, and Abbotsford, fast-growing Canadian communities, and popular destinations for Mexican immigrants. The findings reveal that Mexican immigrants living in the suburbs of Vancouver face numerous barriers, including lack of access to affordable housing to rent or buy, lack of information on settlement services, and difficulty securing acceptable employment. © 2022, El Colegio de la Frontera Norte.

This study explored how religious institutions affect refugee settlement in Kelowna, a mid-size city in British Columbia. Kelowna has had a significant increase in refugee sponsorship since the 2015 Syrian crisis, and most private sponsorship has involved churches and the local mosque, in collaboration with government-funded settlement services and community partners. We collected data through a questionnaire distributed among former refugees and semi-structured interviews with key informants including clergy, refugee-sponsorship groups, and service providers. The results reveal that religious institutions help refugees cope with barriers and challenges in Kelowna in three main ways: bridging language barriers between newcomers, service providers, and sponsorship providers; helping newcomers establish new lives in Kelowna and move toward integration; and helping newcomers move away from precarity toward prosperity as they re-establish themselves and their families. © 2023 The Authors.

How can we best capture the unfolding of this dimension in researching? We discuss these questions via the description of a community event where the siblings were directly implicated and an “emotional episode” arose leading to humor in one sense but also stress on the other as the younger sibling struggled to intervene and interrupt his older brother’s presentation. We discuss and analyze this “key emotional episode” by placing it in the cultural upbringing of the siblings involved in the study as well as co-authors’ reactions to the same episode. We conclude by stating the necessity to know your audience and the approach most conducive to fit the culture of community engagement. Further, we argue that in this time when so much emphasis is placed on team research, we know so much about the academic credentials and skills of our project team members, but little about their personal upbringing and how this can influence relationships and interpretations of findings. © The Author(s) 2024.","community; emotional episode; ethnic media; Montréal; Portuguese; siblings","","","","","","Amilie Chalifoux; Casa dos Açores provided space; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (892-2018-3024)","The authors thank all research participants for their time and participation in this study.

The purpose of this study is to examine the behaviour, strategies and barriers faced by owners of ethnic businesses in order to evaluate how race and ethnicity impact upon entrepreneurship. In particular, the study aims at investigating whether intergroup differences exist with respect to the utilisation of group resources (such as family, friends, and community support/ties) and how these resources contribute to the formation, maintenance and success of Portuguese- and Black-owned businesses. Data were obtained from a questionnaire survey that was administered to Portuguese and Black entrepreneurs in the Toronto CMA. The evidence indicates that Portuguese differ significantly from Black entrepreneurs in that they rely more often on their community ('ethnic') resources. However, Black entrepreneurs encountered more barriers in starting and/or operating their current business, particularly in obtaining credit/loans from financial institutions and banks. Nonetheless, despite such barriers, Black entrepreneurs are more optimistic than the Portuguese with respect to the future of their businesses. The 'demographic revolution' that is taking place in Canada, and particularly in Toronto-with the arrival of important contingents of visible minorities-is pointed to by Black entrepreneurs as one of the major reasons for their optimism regarding the growth of Black entrepreneurship in Toronto.","","Canada;

This study considered immigrants’ settlement experiences, including their access to local services and their housing experiences and outcomes, in the cities of Kelowna and Kamloops, with a focus on the housing rental market, and reliance on community services. The results of the study include recommendations for improving immigrants’ settlement and integration in urban areas in the interior of British Columbia. Survey data were gathered between April and August 2015 from 80 recent immigrant renters in the cities of Kelowna (40) and in Kamloops (40). Findings suggest that immigrants find their housing more difficult than anticipated, largely due to unexpectedly high costs and unfamiliarity with the Canadian housing system. Few immigrants in either city relied on local community organizations or government-sponsored ones to find a place to live and/or a job upon arrival in Kelowna or Kamloops, although those who did found them very helpful. Immigrants relied mostly on their family and friends for initial assistance, but would have preferred to have received more information prior to or on their arrival. They recommended that settlement and housing services offer more direct assistance to new immigrants. For policies to succeed in attracting and retaining immigrants to these cities in British Columbia’s interior depends on the presence of (a) more subsidized/affordable housing; (b) job opportunities that match immigrants’ qualifications and that offer an adequate income; and (c) quality services and programs to integrate new immigrants into the community. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Community services; Employment; Housing; Immigrants; Integration; Small cities; Western Canada","British Columbia; Canada; Kamloops; Kelowna; affordable housing; employment; housing policy; immigrant; settlement pattern; urban housing","","","","","Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of Pathways to Prosperity in the form of a research grant.

While the Quebec sovereignty issue has been around for some time and earlier exodus from the province, particularly among anglophones, is largely regarded as “forced” in some way, this study neither confirms the 1995 Sovereignty Referendum as a paramount factor in explaining outmigration from Quebec nor points to a real reluctance to leave Montreal. The decision to move is influenced by the interplay of a multitude of factors. The political influence is only an added factor to longstanding economic decline and cultural clash. Moreover, if there is any impulsion, the degree varies among different cultural and socioeconomic groups. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Anglophones; Impelled migration; Political instability; Quebec sovereignty","","","","","","University of Alabama, UA; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (410-94-0921)","Funding text 1: *Kathleen O’Reilly would like to acknowledge the University of Alabama Graduate Council for the Research Fellowship and Student Research and Travel Grant that made this project possible.; Funding text 2: *We wish to thank David Hanna, Université du Québec à Montréal, for his helpful suggestion on the study area, all students in York University’s geography field course 1995–1996 for their contribution to the data collection process, Xiaofeng Liu for research assistance, and the three reviewers and the editor for their helpful comments.

In Kelowna, B.C., a city known for its high housing costs, women encounter significant obstacles in securing affordable rental housing. This study involving 25 women renting in Kelowna sheds light on their preferences, concerns, and strategies for navigating this challenging housing market. The research highlights that women prioritize rental units that are not only affordable but also safe and well-located. Key barriers identified include the high cost of housing, scarcity of affordable rental options in desirable neighborhoods, inadequate safety features in rental units, and discrimination based on income sources. Data was gathered through self-administered questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with ten key informants, revealing pervasive challenges and suggesting policy recommendations. These insights contribute to understanding the specific hurdles women face in securing affordable, suitable and adequate rental housing in mid-sized Canadian cities like Kelowna. Addressing these barriers requires multifaceted solutions, including increasing affordable housing options, improving safety standards, and policies that combat income-based discrimination. By implementing these measures, Kelowna can enhance housing accessibility and quality of life for all residents, particularly women struggling in the rental market. © 2024 Housing Education and Research Association.","affordability; Canada; gender; Housing","","","","","","","","Agrawal S., Sangapala P., Does community size matter in the settlement process?

Because the impacts of international migration and immigration are experienced locally, there is a need to better understand how settlement and integration activities can be tailored to the local context. While many immigrants have settled in metropolitan areas, there is need to better understand how immigrants settle in small cities outside large urban areas. A study was undertaken in Kelowna and Kamloops, two small cities in the interior of British Columbia (BC), Canada, to learn about immigrants’ settlement and housing experiences from the perspective of settlement practitioners and service providers. Unaffordable housing, limited employment opportunities, and language barriers were found to be the most significant challenges.

This chapter explores the settlement and housing experiences of recent immigrants in Burnaby, Richmond, and Surrey – three culturally diverse and fast-growing Vancouver suburbs – as well as the interactions between suburbanization processes and the housing strategies of migrants. Securing good-quality, affordable housing is key to the successful resettlement and integration of immigrants. For this study, data were collected from questionnaire surveys administered to 137 immigrants renting in the suburbs of Vancouver. The findings revealed that transitioning from their homelands was a stressful and costly experience. Given the escalating housing costs in the rental and homeownership markets and low vacancy rates, most participants had difficulties finding housing. Participants coped by sharing housing with relatives or friends to save money or by renting a basement. They also reported financial stress, with most living in unaffordable rental housing. The low vacancy rates in Vancouver’s suburbs have created a ‘landlord’s market’ and about one-third of participants reported perceived discrimination based on income, large family size, immigrant status, and general mistrust of their cultural, religious, racial, or ethnic backgrounds. © The Author(s) 2024.","Affordable housing; Immigrants; Rental housing; Suburbs; Vancouver","","","","","","","","Addie J., Fiedler R., Keil R., Cities on the edge: Suburban constellations in Canada, Canadian Cities in Transition: Understanding Contemporary Urbanism, pp. 292-310, (2020); August M., Walks A., Gentrification, suburban decline, and the financialization of multi-family rental housing: The case of Toronto, Geoforum, 89, 2, pp. 124-136, (2018); Boeing G., Online rental housing market representation and the digital reproduction of urban inequality, Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space, 52, 1, pp. 449-468, (2019); Bunting T., Walks A., Filion P., The uneven geography of housing affordability stress in Canadian metropolitan areas, Housing Studies, 19, 3, pp. 361-393, (2004); Carter T., Vitiello D., Immigrants, refugees, and housing, Immigrant Geographies of North American Cities, pp. 91-111, (2012); About Affordable Housing in Canada, (2018); Census of Population, (2021); Dowling R., Neotraditionalism in the suburban landscape: Cultural geographies of exclusion in Vancouver, Canada, Urban Geography, 19, 2, pp. 105-122, (1998); Drolet J.L., Teixeira C., Fostering immigrant settlement and housing in small cities: Voices of settlement practitioners and service providers in British Columbia, Canada, The Social Science Journal, pp. 1-15, (2020); Fiedler R., Schuurman N., Hyndman J., Hidden homelessness: An indicator-based approach for examining the geographies of recent immigrants at-risk of homelessness in Greater Vancouver, Cities, 23, 3, pp. 205-216, (2006); Fong E., Berry B., Immigration and the City, (2017); Francis J., Hiebert D., Shaky foundations: Refugees in Vancouver’s housing market, The Canadian Geographer, 58, 1, pp. 63-78, (2014); Canada’s National Housing Strategy: A Place to Call Home, (2017); Grant J., Walks A., Ramos H., Evaluating Neighbourhood Inequality and Change: Lessons from a National Comparison, pp. 252-279, (2020); Grigoryeva I., Ley D., The price ripple effect in the Vancouver housing market, Urban Geography, 40, 8, pp. 1168-1190, (2019); Hiebert D., Newcomers in the Canadian housing market: A longitudinal study, 2001-2005, The Canadian Geographer, 53, 3, pp. 268-287, (2009); Hiebert D., Ethnocultural minority enclaves in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver (IRPP study 52), Institute for Research on Public Policy, (2015); Hiebert D., Immigrants and refugees in the housing markets of Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, 2011, Canadian Journal of Urban Research, 26, 2, pp. 52-78, (2017); Hiebert D., Sherrell K., The Integration and Inclusion of Newcomers in Canada: The Case of British Columbia, (2010); Jones C.E., Transit-Oriented Development and Suburban Gentrification: A ‘natural reality’ of Refugee Displacement in Metro Vancouver.

Data for the study were obtained from a participant observation study of a sample of real estate agents. Empirical evidence indicates that the ethnicity of real estate agents (Portuguese versus non-Portuguese) and the brokers for whom they work (Portuguese-owned firms versus non-Portuguese-owned firms) determine to a considerable extent the marketing strategies of agents and the neighborhoods they recommend. © 1995 by Association of American Geographers.","Canada; Ethnicity; Housing; Portuguese; Real estate agent; Search process","Canada, Toronto, Mississauga; ethnicity effect; housing search; participant observation; Portuguese firm; real estate agent","","","","","York University, York University","*I would  like to  thank Robert Murdie of  the Geography Depament, York  University, for  his  constructme criticism on earlier drafts of  this paper.

Suggestions for better serving programs and policies, elicited from this diverse group of immigrants and refugees, are reviewed within the current political context in Canada. © 2017, © 2017 Applied Geography Conferences.","Canada; recent immigrants; rental housing; suburbs; Vancouver","","","","","","Metropolis British Columbia","The author acknowledges the financial support of Metropolis British Columbia in awarding a research grant.","Allen J., McDowell L., Landlords and property: Social relations in the private residential sector, (1989); Brunner L.R., Friesen C., Changing faces, changing neighbourhoods: Government-assisted refugee settlement patterns in Metro Vancouver, Our diverse cities: British Columbia, pp. 93-110, (2011); Newcomers' housing: A chapter from the Canadian observer, (2014); Carter T., Vitiello D., Immigrants, refugees, and housing, Immigrant geographies of North American cities, pp. 91-111, (2012); What we heard: Shaping Canada's national housing strategy, (2016); Darden J.T., The African diaspora in Canada: Historical and contemporary immigration and employment practices in Toronto, The African diaspora in the United States and Canada at the dawn of the 21st century, pp. 49-60, (2009); Teixeira C., Li W., Homeownership among immigrants in Canada and the United States: Similarities and differences, The housing and economic experiences of immigrants in US and Canadian cities, pp. 43-68, (2015); Darden J.T., Teixeira C., The African diaspora in Canada, The African diaspora in the United States and Canada at the dawn of the 21st century, pp. 13-34, (2009); Fiedler R., Schuurman N., Hyndman J., Hidden homelessness: An indicator-based approach for examining the geographies of recent immigrants at-risk of homelessness in Greater Vancouver, Cities, 23, pp. 205-216, (2006); Haan M., Yu Z., Household formation and homeownership: A comparison of immigrant racialized minority cohorts in Canada and the United States, The housing and economic experiences of immigrants in US and Canadian cities, pp. 69-97, (2015); Hiebert D., Ethnocultural minority enclaves in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, (2015); Hulchanski J.D., Shapcott M., Introduction: Finding room in the housing system for all Canadians, Finding room: Policy options for a Canadian rental housing market, pp. 3-12, (2004); Kobayashi A., Li W., Teixeira C., Immigrant geographies: Issues and debates, Immigrant geographies of North American cities, pp. xiv-xxxviii, (2012); Ley D., Smith H., Is there an immigrant “underclass” in Canadian cities, Working Paper Series 97–08, Vancouver Centre of Excellence, Research on Immigration and Integration in the Metropolis, (1997); Lo L., Li W., Economic experiences of immigration, Immigrant geographies of North American cities, pp. 112-137, (2012); Lo L., Wang S., Anisef P., Preston V., Basu R., Recent immigrants' awareness of access to, use of, and satisfaction with settlement services in York Region, (2010); Mensah J., Black Canadians: History, experiences, social conditions, (2010); Murdie R.A., Preston V., Chevalier N., Ghosh S., Immigrants and housing: A review of Canadian literature from 1900 to 2005, (2006); Murdie R.A., Skop E., Immigration and urban and suburban settlements, Immigrant geographies of North American cities, pp. 48-68, (2012); Murdie R.A., Teixeira C., Towards a comfortable neighborhood and appropriate housing: Immigrant experiences in Toronto, The world in a city, pp. 132-191, (2003); Bunting T., Filion P., The city as social space, Canadian cities in transition: The twenty-first century, pp. 198-223, (2006); Novac S., Brown J., Bourbonnais C., Transitional housing: Objectives, indicators of success, and outcomes, (2004); Novac S., Darden J., Hulchanski D., Seguin A.-M., Berneche F., Housing discrimination in Canada: The state of knowledge., (2002); Pendakur K., Pendakur R., The colour of money redux: Immigrant/ethnic earnings disparity in Canada, 2001–2006, Immigrant geographies of North American cities, pp. 227-260, (2012); Preston V., Murdie R.A., Wedlock J., Agrawal S., Anucha U., D'Addario S., Kwak M., Logan L., Murnaghan S.M., Immigrants and homelessness—At risk in Canada's outer suburbs, Canadian Geographer, 53, pp. 288-304, (2009); Qadeer M.A., Multicultural cities: Toronto, New York and Los Angeles, (2016); Ray B., Moore E., Access to homeownership among immigrant groups in Canada, The Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology, 28, pp. 1-27, (1991); Ray B., Preston V., Geographies of discrimination: Variations in perceived discomfort and discrimination in Canada's gateway cities, Journal of Immigrant & Refugee Studies, 7, pp. 228-249, (2009); Sherrell K., At home in Surrey?

This study explores the structure and functioning of Portuguese community organizations and their role in facilitating cultural preservation and adaptation among immigrants and their descendants. Questionnaire surveys revealed that Portuguese organizations provide culturally oriented services including social, cultural, and educational activities. Many played a key role in facilitating the social-cultural transition from voluntary segregation during settlement and community formation from the 1950s to the 1970s, and continue to help community members adapt to their new society by helping them find housing and employment. This study also revealed the need for more research on community organizations that facilitate cultural preservation and social mobility. Few studies have explored ethnocultural organizations outside Canada’s major urban centres; this lack of comparative research is remarkable given the recent trend of immigrants bypassing Canada’s inner cities and settling directly in the suburbs or in small-and mid-size cities. Overall, the integration experiences of new immigrants present oppor-tunities and challenges, and government policy must focus on reducing the challenges faced by many ethno-cultural organizations as they try to serve new immigrants. © 2023, Canadian Ethnic Studies Association.
