Fertility rates have declined, cohabitation rates have increased, age at marriage has gone up, and nonmarital childbearing has become more common in most postindustrial settings. A dominant theoretical explanation for these changes is second demographic transition (SDT) theory, which posits widespread value change towards individualism and postmaterialist concerns. In contrast, gender equity theory emphasizes structural changes, including women's increased participation in the public sphere and the resulting incompatibility of women's domestic and public roles given the slower adaptation on the part of families and institutions to adapt to women's new roles. We test the predictions of these two theoretical frameworks by analyzing fertility decline in 27 European societies. We find evolving gender egalitarianism, measured by the prevalence of gender-egalitarian attitudes, to have greater explanatory power than SDT-related ideational changes. The gender equity framework is particularly relevant in explaining the recent fertility trajectories of Central, Eastern, and Southern European countries. © 2022 The Population Council, Inc.","","Europe; conceptual framework; demographic transition; empirical analysis; fertility; theory; womens status","","","","","","","Allison P.D., Multiple Regression: A Primer, (1999); Ahn N., Mira P., A Note on the Changing Relationship between Fertility and Female Employment Rates in Developed Countries, Journal of Population Economics, 15, pp. 667-682, (2002); Arpino B., Esping-Andersen G., Pessin L., How Do Changes in Gender Role Attitudes Towards Female Employment Influence Fertility?

Institutional social capital is constituted by the resources inherent in an organization (such as a school) and thereby available to members of that organization. This is contrasted with the social capital available to individuals through their own personal networks. In the labor market context, an example of institutional social capital is the ties that schools have with employers who recruit a proportion of their new employees as they prepare to graduate. The paper examines how these ties and the norms governing the important labor market screening role played by the high school developed in post-WWII Japan. I also discuss an important positive externality - social control over students - generated by schools' institutional social capital. Finally, I examine current challenges to Japanese high schools' institutional social capital.","","Japan; human capital; labor market; labor policy","","","","","William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Center for Advanced Study, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, CAS","This research was funded in part by a grant from the Pacific Basin Research Center, through their program on `Social Capital Formation in Asia and the Pacific.'

The authors argue that this approach obscures theoretically important distinctions in attitudes and renders analyses of change over time incomplete. Using latent class analysis, they investigate the multidimensional nature of gender-role attitudes in 17 postindustrial European countries. They identify three distinct varieties of egalitarianism that they designate as liberal egalitarianism, egalitarian familism, and flexible egalitarianism. They show that while traditional gender-role attitudes have precipitously and uniformly declined in accordance with the “rising tide” narrative toward greater egalitarianism, the relative prevalence of different egalitarianisms varies markedly across countries. Furthermore, they find that European nations are not converging toward one dominant egalitarian model but rather, remain differentiated by varieties of egalitarianism. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

Drawing upon historical materials, survey and statistical data, and extensive interviews in Japan, Mary Brinton provides an in-depth and original examination of the role of gender in Japan's phenomenal postwar economic growth. Brinton finds that the educational system, the workplace, and the family in Japan have shaped the opportunities open to female workers. Women move in and out of the workforce depending on their age and family duties, a great disadvantage in a system that emphasizes seniority and continuous work experience. Brinton situates the vicious cycle that perpetuates traditional gender roles within the concept of human capital development, whereby Japanese society ""underinvests"" in the capabilities of women. The effects of this underinvestment are reinforced indirectly as women sustain male human capital through unpaid domestic labor and psychological support. Brinton provides a clear analysis of a society that remains misunderstood, but whose economic transformation has been watched with great interest by the industrialized world. © All rights reserved.","","","","","","","","","Abegglen J.C., The Japanese Factory: Aspects of Its Social Organization, (1958);

On the other hand, greater gender equality may positively influence fertility. This paper examines how these two forces interact in Spain. We use in-depth interviews to analyse fertility decision-making among young and highly educated partnered adults living in urban areas. Highly gender-egalitarian interviewees are less likely to perceive economic insecurity as an obstacle to proceeding to a next birth than less egalitarian interviewees. But there is not necessarily a difference in these two groups’ overall fertility intentions, as highly egalitarian interviewees’ greater valuation of stable employment for both partners requires institutional and policy support for dual-earner couples’ childrearing. When we look only at interviewees who express economic insecurity, somewhat higher fertility intentions are expressed by those holding less gender-egalitarian attitudes. Our results underline the complexity of the interrelationships between economic insecurity, gender egalitarianism, and fertility intentions. © 2019, © 2019 Population Investigation Committee.","fertility intentions; gender egalitarianism; perceived economic insecurity; qualitative analysis; Spain","Adult; Employment; Female; Fertility; Humans; Intention; Interviews as Topic; Male; Sexism; Socioeconomic Factors; Spain; Spain; adult; complexity; decision making; fertility; gender issue; qualitative analysis; urban population; young population; adult; behavior; employment; female; fertility; human; interview; male; psychology; sexism; socioeconomics; Spain","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1123885); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (657030); Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, UAB, (08193 Bellaterra/Barcelona)","although this paper was written while at Harvard University.

The scholars who supervised my dissertation research later told me that they had been sure my research plan would fail. Fortunately, they were wrong. But unfortunately, their prediction was based on sound reasoning: they were cognizant of a major impediment facing social scientists attempting to do the type of research in Japan that I had proposed. That impediment is the virtual unavailability in Japan of individual-level data-""raw"" data, as social scientists often call it-with which to carry out statistical analyses. This problem has hampered American research on Japan in a number of substantive and theoretical areas in sociology, political science, and economics. In the case of my own discipline, sociology, it has hindered the training of graduate students who are interested in joining the ranks of the handful of academic researchers who claim dual loyalty to Japanese studies and to sociology as a discipline.1 In the extreme, the unavailability of data so discourages Ph.D. students that they make the unfortunately pragmatic choice of abandoning the study of Japan altogether in favor of a research site (often the United States) where high-quality, individual-level data are accessible. This seems a rash choice indeed, but it is a survival strategy in those fields in sociology that more or less require practitioners to carry out empirical research with large survey data sets. © 2003 by University of Hawai'i Press.","","","","","","","","","Brinton M.C., The social-institutional bases of gender stratification: Japan as an illustrative case, American Journal of Sociology, 94, 2, pp. 300-334, (1988); Gender stratification in contemporary urban japan, American Sociological Review, 54, 4, pp. 549-564, (1989); Women and the Economic Miracle: Gender and Work in Postwar Japan., (1993); Manufacturing class: Urban japanese high schools at work, Hitotsubashi Journal of Social Studies, 30, pp. 49-60, (1998); Social capital in the japanese youth labor market: Labor market policy, schools, and norms, Policy Sciences, 33, 4, pp. 289-306, (2000); Married women's labor in east asian economies, Women's Working Lives in East Asia., pp. 1-37, (2001)","","","University of Hawai'i Press","","","","","","","978-082482525-6","","","English","Doing Fieldwork in Jpn.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33744933031"

These approaches ignore in their own ways the important role that occupations play in transferring opportunities from one generation to the next. In new analyses of nationally representative data from the United States, Sweden, Germany, and Japan, the authors show that (a) occupations are an important conduit for social reproduction, (b) the most extreme rigidities in the mobility regime are only revealed when analyses are carried out at the occupational level, and (c) much of what shows up as big-class reproduction in conventional mobility analyses is in fact occupational reproduction in disguise. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","","Cross-Cultural Comparison;

Countries with generous work-family policies tend to have a lower proportion of women in positions of authority and greater occupational sex segregation than countries without such policies. In order to explain this paradox, scholars have argued that work-family policies may create incentives for employers to exclude women from well-paying jobs. This argument, however, has been left untested due to the absence of firm-level data on promotions. This paper seeks to make both a theoretical and an empirical contribution to this literature. At the theoretical level, we argue that the effect of work-family policies is contingent upon labor market context and organizational practices, which shape employers’ incentives or disincentives to implement work-family policies to more fully utilize female workers. Empirically, we use over-time firm-level data to test how government policy interventions in Japan to increase work-family benefits have affected female promotion rates in private companies. Analyzing changes in women's promotion rates across 1000 large companies from 1987 to 2009, we find evidence that employers have tended to promote more, not fewer, women subsequent to policy interventions. Additionally, employers who provided more generous work-family benefits promoted more women. Our findings point to the importance of labor market context in structuring employers’ incentives to leverage work-family policy reforms to utilize skilled female labor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Japan; Labor market institutions; Organizations and inequality; Work-family policies","","","","","","","","Acker J., Inequality regimes: gender, class, and race in organizations, Gender & Society, 20, 4, pp. 441-464, (2006); Adsera A., Changing fertility rates in developed countries: the impact of labor market institutions, Journal of Population Economics, 17, pp. 17-43, (2004); Aguilera R.V., Filatotchev I., Gospel H., Jackson G., An organizational approach to comparative corporate governance: costs, contingencies, and complementarities, Organization Science, 19, 3, pp. 475-492, (2008); Albrecht J.W., Edin P., Sundstrom M., Vroman S.B., Career interruptions and subsequent earnings: a reexamination using swedish data, Journal of Human Resources, 34, pp. 294-311, (1999); Aoki M., Information, incentives, and bargaining in the japanese economy, (1988); Atsumi N., Work-life balance strategies for advanced companies, Japan Labor Review, 4, 4, pp. 37-58, (2007); Avent-Holt D., Tomaskovic-Devey D., Relational inequality: gender earnings inequality in U.

This study used original data on male university graduates in South Korea to explore the relationships among university prestige, human capital, social background, and students' access to social capital through their university (institutional social capital) and their families and friends (private social capital). The study found that private social capital does not tend to lead to the best jobs. Rather, the probability of being matched with a top employer is higher through direct application and is enhanced at prestigious universities through the schools' provision of introductions to employers. The close relationships among family background, human capital, and university prestige mean that a highly select group of South Korean men acquire the best jobs.","","","","","","","","","Amsden A.H., Asia's Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialization, (1989);

This article uses a dynamic approach to model the determinants of single mothers' entry into and exit from productive activities. Using 14 waves of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the article shows that kin coresidence facilitates young single mothers' entry into productive activities but does not play a significant role in sustaining participation. Women's individual trainability, the local labor market conditions, child support, and some family background factors all play a role. The results also demonstrate the insignificance of race and never-married versus ever-married status.","","","","","","","","","Bartholomew D.J., Stochastic Models for Social Processes, 3d Ed., (1982);

Vogel (July 11, 1930-December 20, 2020) was one of America’s foremost experts on Asia, mastering the Japanese and Chinese languages and contributing important scholarly works on both countries, and on their relationships with each other and with the world. Starting from modest roots in an immigrant family in a small town in Ohio, he came to Harvard in 1953 to train as a sociologist. He then shifted his focus to Asia, spending almost the entirety of his life at Harvard. Vogel had a dramatic impact around the world, not only through his scholarship and the students he trained, but also through his friendship and mentoring of journalists, diplomats, business executives, and foreign leaders as well as through his public policy advice and devotion to institution building, at Harvard as well as nationally and internationally. Active until the end, his sudden death provoked outpourings of gratitude and grief from countless people whose lives he had affected. The present volume, containing fond reminiscences from 155 diverse individuals, conveys what was so extraordinary about the character and life of Ezra Vogel. © 2022 by The President and Fellows of Harvard College.","","","","","","","","","","","","Brill","","","","","","","978-168417667-0; 978-067427827-1","","","English","Remembering Ezra Vogel","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199661297"

For Japan, these are major contributors to the very low birth rate. OBJECTIVE We analyze two unique data sets: dating records covering a two-year period from one of Japan’s largest marriage agencies and in-depth interviews with 30 highly-educated Japanese singles. The longitudinal nature of the quantitative data allows us to test hypotheses about how single men’s and women’s preferences for partners’ characteristics adjust over time. The qualitative data provides a more fine-grained look at Japanese singles’ partner preferences. METHODS We employ fixed-effects regression models to analyze Japanese men’s and women’s preferences for the relative and absolute education, income, and age of potential marriage partners. RESULTS Both the quantitative and qualitative data suggest that Japanese women continue to highly value men’s income-earning capacity. Men, in contrast, value a partner with moderate income-earning potential. Women’s and men’s preferences for partner’s education are somewhat weaker, and women broaden their educational preference over time. CONCLUSION Japanese men’s and women’s preferences for a potential partner’s characteristics are largely consistent with Becker’s theory of gender-role specialization. But we also find evidence consistent with Oppenheimer’s expectation that men are coming to value women’s income-earning capacity more highly than in the past. CONTRIBUTION We use a unique Japanese data set featuring dating records over a two-year period to examine the appropriateness of theories of marital sorting proposed by Becker and Oppenheimer. Our quantitative analysis is complemented by in-depth interviews with Japanese singles. © 2021 Mary C.

Many herald this trend as one of the most troubling of our time. But the decline in marriage does not necessarily signal the demise of the two parent family-over 80 percent of unmarried couples are still romantically involved when their child is born and nearly half are living together. Most claim they plan to marry eventually. Yet half have broken up by their child's third birthday. What keeps some couples together and what tears others apart? After a breakup, how do fathers so often disappear from their children's lives? An intimate portrait of the challenges of partnering and parenting in these families, Unmarried Couples with Children presents a variety of unique findings. Most of the pregnancies were not explicitly planned, but some couples feel having a child is the natural course of a serious relationship. Many of the parents are living with their child plus the mother's child from a previous relationship. When the father also has children from a previous relationship, his visits to see them at their mother's house often cause his current partner to be jealous. Breakups are more often driven by sexual infidelity or conflict than economic problems. After couples break up, many fathers complain they are shut out, especially when the mother has a new partner. For their part, mothers claim to limit dads' access to their children because of their involvement with crime, drugs, or other dangers. For couples living together with their child several years after the birth, marriage remains an aspiration, but something couples are resolutely unwilling to enter without the financial stability they see as a sine qua non of marriage. They also hold marriage to a high relational standard, and not enough emotional attention from their partners is women's number one complaint. Unmarried Couples with Children is a landmark study of the family lives of nearly fifty American children born outside of a marital union at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Based on personal narratives gathered from both mothers and fathers over the first four years of their children's lives, and told partly in the couples' own words, the story begins before the child is conceived, takes the reader through the tumultuous months of pregnancy to the moment of birth, and on through the child's fourth birthday. It captures in rich detail the complex relationship dynamics and powerful social forces that derail the plans of so many unmarried parents. The volume injects some much-needed reality into the national discussion about family values, and reveals that the issues are more complex than our political discourse suggests.

This has generated increased attention to how greater gender equality in the private sphere of the household may contribute to a positive relationship between women’s employment rates and fertility. Building on recent scholarship demonstrating the multidimensionality of gender-role attitudes, we argue that conversely, the prevalence of a gender-role ideology that supports women’s employment but places greater priority on their role as caregivers may depress the higher-order fertility intentions of working mothers. Using data from 25 European countries, we find that this type of gender-role ideology (egalitarian familism) moderates the relationship between mothers’ full-time employment and their intention to have a second child. This holds even after accounting for key features of the policy environment that are likely to mitigate work–family conflict. The analysis suggests that conflicting normative expectations for women’s work and family roles tend to dampen working mothers’ second-order fertility intentions, independent of work–family reconciliation policies. © The Author(s) 2023.","","","","","","","Alexandra Killewald and Joscha Legewie","For thoughtful comments and insights on earlier drafts of this article, we thank Alexandra Killewald and Joscha Legewie.","Ahn N., Mira P., Job bust, baby bust?

It argues that under certain social-institutional constraints it is rational for parents to create an intrafamilial market for education. Japan is used as a model to explore what some of those constraints might be. Parental aspirations for sons will be affected by the sex composition and number of children. The chapter summarizes the nature of the human capital development system in Japan and for illustrative purposes contrasts it with that of the United States. It then develops a number of hypotheses that are suggested by this macro level institutional environment. These go beyond the simple observations that Japanese men and women have varying amounts of education and that parental opinion supports sex-segregated educational outcomes. © 1990 Taylor & Francis.

We appear to be entering just such a period of pessimism about the future of the ongoing ""gender revolution."" After a half-century of dramatic reductions in the gender pay gap and other forms of gender inequality, we now find ourselves poised at a crossroads in which two very plausible futures appear before us, an ""optimistic scenario"" which assumes that the remaining (and very substantial) gender inequalities will continue to erode, and a ""pessimistic scenario"" which treats the gender revolution as stalling and regards contemporary institutional arrangements as an equilibrium.

This trend is less evident in many postindustrial countries characterized by very low fertility. Among such countries, Japan and Korea have exceptionally low proportions of women who remain employed after having children, despite aggressive government policies designed to encourage this. We draw on over 160 in-depth interviews with highly educated Japanese and Korean men and women of childbearing age to uncover the central incompatibilities between married womenâ€™s employment and childrearing. Individualsâ€™ narratives reveal how labor market structure and workplace norms contribute to a highly gendered household division of labor, leading many married women to either forsake employment or to consider having only one child.

Women in Japan are less apt to work as employees, a tendency that increases with age. Likewise, female employees tend to shift from larger to smaller firms across the life cycle, whereas male employees do not. These aggregate patterns imply that Japanese women are seldom placed in career-track positions in large firms early in their careers. Analyses on labour market entry data from the 1984 ""Survey on Work Patterns' substantiate this view. Causal processes governing entrance to large firms and career tracks are examined in the paper, with particular attention to the relative returns to different levels and types of education for Japanese men and women. -from Author","","China; Japan; causal process; education; female employees; gender stratification; geothermal gradient; heat flow; labour force participation; sedimentary basin; thermal conductivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00031224","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024799428"

This article examines the way that these factors are reflected in patterns of age and sex segregation in the occupational structures of the two countries. Occupational age segregation is greater in Japan than in the United States: There are larger age differences among the incumbents of major occupational groups in Japan, and managerial and administrative occupations in particular are dominated by older males. In contrast, occupational sex segregation is slightly lower in Japan than in the United States. This nonintuitive result is due to the greater apparent integration of Japanese women into low-status white-collar and blue-collar occupational groups, resulting from particular labor market processes in those groups. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","age in the occupational structure; Japanese labor market; sex in the occupational structure; United States labor market","","","","","","","","Abegglen, The Japanese Factory: Aspects of Its Social Organization, (1958); Blau, Hendricks, Occupational segregation by sex: Trends and prospects, The Journal of Human Resources, 14, pp. 197-210, (1979); Blossfeld, Labor-market entry and the sexual segregation of careers in the Federal Republic of Germany, American Journal of Sociology, 93, pp. 89-118, (1987); Brinton, The social-institutional bases of gender stratification: Japan as an illustrative case, American Journal of Sociology, 94, pp. 300-334, (1988); Brinton, Gender stratification in contemporary urban Japan, American Sociological Review, 54, pp. 542-557, (1989); Clark, The Japanese Company, (1979); Cole, Work, Mobility, and Participation: A Comparative Study of American and Japanese Industry, (1979); Cole, Tominaga, Japan's changing occupational structure and its significance, Japanese Industrialization and Its Social Consequences, pp. 53-96, (1976); Dore, British Factory, Japanese Factory: The Origins of Diversity in Industrial Relations, (1973); England, Assessing trends in occupational sex segregation, 1900–1976, Sociological Perspectives on Labor Markets, pp. 273-294, (1981); Gordon, The Evolution of Labor Relations in Japan: Heavy Industry, pp. 1853-1955, (1985); Hamilton, Biggart, Market, culture, and authority: A comparative analysis of management and organization in the Far East, American Journal of Sociology, 94, pp. S52-S94, (1988); Jacobs, Long-term trends in occupational segregation by sex, American Journal of Sociology, 95, pp. 160-173, (1989); Kalleberg, Lincoln, The structure of earnings inequality in the United States and Japan, American Journal of Sociology, 94, pp. S121-S153, (1988); Kaufman, Spilerman, The age structures of occupations and jobs, American Journal of Sociology, 87, pp. 827-851, (1982); Koike, Internal labor markets: Workers in large firms, Contemporary Industrial Relations in Japan, pp. 29-62, (1983); Shūgyō kōzō kihon chōsa, (1987); Moen, Continuities and discontinuities in women's labor force activity, Life Course Dynamics: Trajectories and Transitions, 1968–1980, pp. 113-155, (1985); Kokusei chōsa, (1970); Kokusei chōsa, (1980); Osawa, Changing role of education and women workers in Japan, Keio Business Review, 42, pp. 87-101, (1988); Rohlen, For Harmony and Strength, (1974); Saso, Women in the Japanese Workplace, (1990); Shimada, Earnings Structure and Human Investment: A Comparison between the United States and Japan, (1981); 1970 Census of Population, Vol. 1 (Characteristics of the Population), PC70-1-D1-A, (1974); 1980 Census of Population, Vol. 1 (Characteristics of the Population), PC80-1-D1-A, (1984)","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers","","","","","","15737861","","","","English","Sociol Forum","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-21144461478"

We develop a framework for understanding the macro-level conditions that fostered the effectiveness of the system up until the early 1990s. These conditions included a stratified secondary educational system, a large supply of high-quality high school graduates, and high demand for young workers to fill entry-level positions in the internal labor markets of large firms. We use original data from a sample of urban high schools to analyze how Japanese employers' recruitment patterns changed in the 1990s and beyond. The results of that analysis and a counterfactual analysis suggest that recent changes, especially in Japanese employment institutions, have significantly weakened high school-employer relationships. We suggest implications of the Japanese case for school-work processes in other postindustrial societies. © 2010 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.","Employment restructuring;

But the organizational contexts that facilitate or hinder employees' policy usage have been underexamined. This article addresses this gap by analyzing the organizational conditions associated with greater use of parental leave policy in the workplace. The authors draw on organizational data from contemporary Japan, a setting that epitomizes norms of the ideal worker and intensive parenting that are increasingly highlighted in studies of work–family conflict in the United States. Analyzing panel data on more than 500 large Japanese companies from 2001 to 2009, the authors find greater utilization of parental leave policies in firms that have a higher representation of women in managerial positions and that include human resource executives on the corporate board. Usage does not increase, however, in firms that offer parental leave that is longer than legally mandated. These results highlight the importance of key features of the organizational context in enhancing employees' use of parental leave policy. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","diversity; family/medical leave; work and family","","","","","","","","Albiston C.R., Institutional inequality and the mobilization of the family and medical leave act, (2010); Albrecht J.W., Edin P., Sundstrom M., Vroman S.B., Career interruptions and subsequent earnings: A reexamination using Swedish data, Journal of Human Resources, 34, pp. 294-311, (1999); Atsumi N., Work-life balance strategies for advanced companies, Japan Labor Review, 4, pp. 37-58, (2007); Armenia A., Gerstel N., Wing C., Workplace compliance with the law: The case of the family and medical leave act, Work and Occupations, 41, pp. 277-304, (2014); Bailyn L., Breaking the mold: Redesigning work for productive and satisfying lives, (1993); Bergmann B.R., Long leaves, child well-being, and gender equality, Politics and Society, 36, pp. 350-359, (2008); Bertrand M., Black S.E., Jensen S., Lleras-Muney A., Breaking the glass ceiling?

A chief concern is the worsening situation of high school - educated youth versus their college-educated counterparts in terms of wages, turnover rates, and unemployment. Japan has been cited as an example of a country that demonstrates how high school - employer linkages can facilitate the successful and stable transition from high school to work.

However, little research has investigated how workplace norms influence men's household work. Objective This paper takes into account labor market structure, workplace norms, and the legal environment governing working conditions to contextualize men's contribution to household labor and its effect on transition to second birth. Methods Using data from the Japanese Longitudinal Survey of Adults in the 21st Century (2002 Cohort), we employ fixed-effects models to estimate the effect of workplace norms on men's contribution to household work and the effect of men's household work hours on transition to second birth. Results Japanese male university graduates in large firms do a smaller share of household labor than other men. These men are subject to workplace norms prevalent in firm-internal labor markets, which have been supported by Japanese Supreme Court rulings. These norms influence men's allocation of time between the workplace and the home. Moreover, analysis of the transition to second birth indicates that husband's share of household work is an important predictor of second birth, especially for dual-earner couples. CONCLUSIONS Our empirical results suggest that unless changes are made in Japanese employment law and workplace norms, dual-earner couples in particular will continue to face difficulties proceeding to a second birth. CONTRIBUTION This paper demonstrates how the economic and cultural context can create disincentives for men to contribute to household labor, which in turn lowers the probability of transition to second birth. © 2017 Nobuko Nagase & Mary C.

The book argues that Japan is in the midst of profound changes that have had an especially strong impact on the young generation. The country’s renowned “permanent employment system” has unraveled for young workers, only to be replaced by temporary and insecure forms of employment. The much–admired system of moving young people smoothly from school to work has frayed. The book argues that these changes in the very fabric of Japanese postwar institutions have loosened young people’s attachment to school as the launching pad into the world of work and loosened their attachment to the workplace as a source of identity and security. The implications for the future of Japanese society – and the fault lines within it – loom large. © Mary C.

The authors suggest that this is partly because a country's educational system and ways of evaluating students at different educational transitions set the context for the mechanisms through which embodied and objectified cultural capital operate. Moreover, parents in some societies invest in children's ""shadow education"" (extracurricular classes or tutoring) at key educational transitions, and it is not clear whether this replaces cultural capital or supplements it. The authors use data from Japan, a country whose educational system depends heavily but not exclusively on standardized examinations, to examine how cultural capital affects students' progress at three points in the educational process that involve different relative emphasis on examinations and on teachers' subjective judgment. In this way, the authors clarify the ways that embodied and objectified cultural capital exert effects on educational outcomes. © American Sociological Association 2010.","Cultural capital; Educational attainment; Japan; Shadow education","","","","","","","","Amano I., Shiken No Shakaishi (A Social History of School Examinations), (1990); Bourdieu P., Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction, Knowledge, Education, and Cultural Change, pp. 71-112, (1973); Bourdieu P., Forms of Capital, Handbook of the Sociology of Education, pp. 241-258, (1983); Bourdieu P., Jean-Claude P., Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture, (1977); Bray M., Private Supplementary Tutoring: Comparative Perspectives on Patterns and Implications, Compare, 36, pp. 515-530, (2006); Brinton M.C., The Social-institutional Bases of Gender Stratification: Japan as an Illustrative Case, American Journal of Sociology, 94, pp. 300-334, (1988); Brinton M.C., Women and the Economic Miracle: Gender and Work in Postwar Japan, (1993); Brinton M.C., Married Women's Labor in East Asian Economies, Women's Working Lives in East Asia, pp. 1-37, (2001); Brinton M.C., Trouble in Paradise: The Youth Labor Market and School-work Institutions in Japan's Economy, The New Economic Sociology of Capitalism, pp. 419-444, (2005); Buchmann C., Getting Ahead in Kenya: Social Capital, Shadow Education, and Achievement, Schooling and Social Capital in Diverse Cultures, pp. 133-159, (2002); Cummings W.K., Education and Equality in Japan, (1980); de Graaf N.D., de Graaf P.M., Kraaykamp G., Parental Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment in the Netherlands: A Refinement of the Cultural Capital Perspective, Sociology of Education, 73, pp. 92-111, (2000); DiMaggio P., Cultural Capital and School Success: The Impact of Status Culture Participation on the Grades of U.S, High School Students.

This paper brings the organizational level into the analysis of work-family policy effects on female employees. We theorize that managers' evaluation of female employees' use of parental leave is shaped not only by policy content, but also by labour market structure and the dominant cultural model of household gender relations. Using Japan as a case study, we analyse in-depth interviews with human resource managers in 25 large firms and show that managers' implementation of parental leave and their evaluation of leave-takers occur within the context of norms about ideal employee behaviour in firm-internal labour markets and about the gendered division of care work. These conflicting norms produce managerial expectations that can only be met by a small number of women. The article contributes to theory and research on work-family policies and female employment outcomes in two ways: by demonstrating the critical role of managers, and by showing how labour market structure and associated work norms together with the dominant cultural understanding of household gender relations act as filters through which managers construct their evaluations of employees who take leave. © 2015 The Author.","Firms; Japan; Social policy; State; Women","","","","","","","","Abe Y., Long-Term Impacts of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act in Japan, Japan Labor Review, 10, pp. 20-34, (2013); Albrecht J.W., Edin P.-A., Sundstrom M., Vroman S., Career Interruptions and Subsequent Earnings: A Reexamination Using Swedish Data, Journal of Human Resources, 34, pp. 294-311, (1999); Aoki M., Toward an Economic Model of the Japanese Firm, Journal of Economic Literature, 28, pp. 1-27, (1990); Atsumi N., Work-Life Balance Strategies for Advanced Companies, Japan Labor Review, 4, pp. 37-58, (2007); Bergmann B.R., Long Leaves, ChildWell-Being, and Gender Equality, Politics and Society, 36, pp. 350-359, (2008); Bettio F., Plantenga J., Comparing Care Regimes in Europe, Feminist Economics, 10, pp. 85-113, (2004); Blair-Loy M., Competing Devotions: Career and Family among Women Executives, (2003); Boling P., Policies to Support Working Mothers and Children in Japan, The Political Economy of Japan's Low Fertility, pp. 131-154, (2007); Boling P., Demography, Culture, and Policy: Understanding Japan's Low Fertility, Population and Development Review, 34, pp. 307-326, (2008); Boushey H., The Role of the Government inWork-Family Conflict, The Future of Children, 21, pp. 163-190, (2011); Brinton M.C., Women and the Economic Miracle: Gender and Work in Postwar Japan, (1993); Brinton M.C., Women's Working Lives in East Asia, (2001); Buttner T., Lutz W., Estimating Fertility Responses to Policy Measures in the German Democratic-Republic, Population and Development Review, 16, pp. 539-555, (1990); Bygren M., Duvander A.-Z., Parents'Workplace Situation and Fathers' Parental Leave Use, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 68, pp. 363-372, (2006); Cha Y., Weeden K.A., Overwork and the Slow Convergence in the GenderWage Gap in Wages, American Sociological Review, 79, pp. 457-484, (2014); Ciccia R., Verloo M., Parental Leave Regulations and the Persistence of the Male Breadwinner Model: Using Fuzzy-Set Ideal Type Analysis to Assess Gender Equality in an Enlarged Europe, Journal of European Social Policy, 22, pp. 507-528, (2012); Esping-Andersen G., Hybrid or Unique?

A set of macro–micro mechanisms are identified, which are examined empirically using comparative data for seven countries from the Gender and Generations Survey. Social norms, and in particular social norms related to gender roles, are at the center of the analysis as a mechanism that conditions the translation of intentions into behavior. Societies that discourage gender equity in the private sphere of the household tend to be characterized by a strong breadwinner ideology. In these societies, the valorization of women’s role as household manager and mother is mirrored by the valorization of men’s role as breadwinner for the household. In these societies, there is a strong norm that a young man should be able to support a family prior to getting married and becoming a parent, that is, that males should prove themselves to be adequate breadwinners. When combined with changing structural conditions, such as high unemployment rates, prolonged periods of education, and increasingly insecure terms of employment in flexible labor markets, this norm will lead to declining birth rates. Hence, norms work as a mechanism that filters the effect of structural conditions so that structural constraints on fertility, such as limited labor market opportunities for young men, will affect fertility outcomes via the mechanism of gender-role norms. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.","gender; low fertility; norms","","","","","","","","Abbott A., Of time and space: The contemporary relevance of the Chicago school, Social Forces, 75, pp. 1149-1182, (1997); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., The influence of attitudes on behavior, The handbook of attitudes, pp. 173-221, (2005); Becker G.S., A treatise on the family, (1981); Billari F.C., Kohler H.-P., Patterns of low and lowest-low fertility in Europe, Population Studies, 58, pp. 161-176, (2004); Billari F.C., Philipov D., Testa M.R., Attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural control: Explaining fertility intentions in Bulgaria, European Journal of Population, 25, pp. 439-465, (2009); Bongaarts J., Fertility and reproductive preferences in post-transitional societies, Population and Development Review, 27, pp. 260-281, (2001); Breslin M., Japanese women want more children than their total fertility rate suggests, Family Planning Perspectives, 29, pp. 291-292, (1997); Brinton M.C., Lee D.J., Gender essentialism and low fertility in postindustrial societies, (2013); Cha Y., Reinforcing separate spheres: The effect of spousal overwork on men’s and women’s employment in dual-earner households, American Sociological Review, 75, pp. 303-329, (2010); Coleman J.S., Foundations of social theory, (1990); Coleman J.S., A vision for sociology, James S.
