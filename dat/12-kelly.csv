The objective of this study was to investigate the association of these health outcomes with farm activities. Methods: We evaluated the Keokuk County Rural Health Study (KCRHS) enrollment data for farm activities and the two health outcomes chronic bronchitis based on self-reported symptoms and airflow obstruction based on spirometry. We used logistic regression to model the health outcomes, yielding an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for farm activities while adjusting for potential confounders and other risk factors. Results: Of the 1234 farmers, 104 (8.4%) had chronic bronchitis, 75 (6.1%) fulfilled the criteria for airflow obstruction, and the two outcomes overlapped by 18 participants. Chronic bronchitis without airflow obstruction (n = 86) had a statistically significant association with crop storage insecticides (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.6, 6.1) and a low number of years (≤ 3) worked with turkeys (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2, 9.4). The latter result should be interpreted with caution because it is based on a small number of cases (n = 5). Airflow obstruction with or without chronic bronchitis (n = 75) was significantly associated with ever working in a hog or chicken confinement setting (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0, 4.5). Conclusions: These results suggest that work with crop storage insecticides or turkeys may increase the risk for chronic bronchitis and work in hog or chicken confinement may increase the risk for airflow obstruction. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Airflow obstruction; Chronic bronchitis; Farm activities; Rural adults","Bronchitis, Chronic; Farms; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Insecticides; Iowa; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; insecticide; agricultural land; chronic bronchitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; forced expiratory volume; human; Iowa","","Insecticides, ","","","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, (07/CCU706145, 50OH07548); National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH; University of Iowa, UI","The KCRHS was supported (in part) by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under Grants #U07/CCU706145 (Round 1) and #U50OH07548 (Round 2 and 3) to the Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health at The University of Iowa.

This study aimed to determine the distribution of injury risk factors in a rural Iowa community and to identify the rural subgroups at highest risk for injury. Methods: We reported on 1583 participants, aged ≥25 years, from Round One of the Keokuk County Rural Health Study, a longitudinal panel study of a rural community. The self-reported data were collected during face-to-face interviews. Results: Our data suggested that several risk factors for injury are not uniformly distributed among rural populations. Male farmers were significantly less likely to wear their seatbelts than townspeople or rural nonfarmers. However, farm women were as likely to wear seatbelts as other women. Both male and female farmers were more likely to use all-terrain vehicles than townspeople or rural nonfarmers. In contrast, townspeople were more likely to ride bicycles than either farmers or rural nonfarmers. Townspeople were less likely to have firearms in their homes than either farmers or rural nonfarmers. Farmers were most likely to have fired a gun in the last year. Male farmers aged <65 years were less than half as likely as other men the same age to report a history of alcohol abuse. Binge drinking was equally frequent among farmers, rural nonfarmers, and townspeople. Conclusions: These differences in risk behavior in a rural county suggest the possibility of targeting specific rural injury prevention interventions at those with the highest risk for dangerous behavior.

These agents were selected because they inhibit the passage of calcium through calcium selective channels in the plasma membrane, thereby blocking calcium mediated electromechanical coupling in contractile tissue and resulting in peripheral arterial vasodilation. Three groups of pigs were used in this study. All skin flaps in this study were 3 cm wide and 12 cm long. The first group (10 flaps) served as controls with no pharmacologic manipulations. Pigs in group II (15 flaps) received verapamil (80 mg orally, three times a day) for 7 days postoperatively. Pigs in group III (15 flaps) received nifedipine (10 mg orally, three times a day) for 7 days postoperatively. Statistical analysis of the results demonstrated that both verapamil and nifedipine resulted in significant enhancement of skin flap survival. The increased survival of the skin flaps produced by nifedipine as compared to verapamil was statistically significant. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Animal models; Calcium channel blockers; Ischemia; Skin flap","nifedipine; verapamil; animal model; article; controlled study; drug therapy; female; nonhuman; oral drug administration; skin flap survival; swine","","nifedipine, 21829-25-4; verapamil, 152-11-4, 52-53-9","","","","","Baran N., Horton C., Growth of skin grafts, flaps, and scars in young mini-pigs, Plast Reconstr Surg, 50, (1976); Bibi R., Ferder M., Strauch B., Prevention of flap necrosis by chlorpromazine, Plast Reconstr Surg, 77, (1986); Cherry G., The differing effects of isoxuprine on muscle flap and skin flap survival in the pig, Plast Reconstr Surg, 64, (1979); Chowardy R., Berkower A., Moss M., Et al., Fluorocarbon enhancement of skin flap survival in rats, Plast Reconstr Surg, 79, (1987); Cohen B., Harmon C., Phizackerley B., Glucose metabolism in experimental skin flaps, Plast Reconstr Surg, 71, (1983); Davidson R., Bursten S., Et al., Oral nifedipine for the treatment of patients with severe hypertension, Am J Med, 79, (1985); Donovan W., Experimental models in skin flap research, Skin flaps, (1975); Emerson D., Sykes P., The effect of prostacyclin on experimental random pattern flaps of the rat, Br J Plast Surg, 34, (1981); Finseth F., Adelberg M., Prevention of skin flap necrosis by a course of treatment with vasodilator drugs, Plast Reconstr Surg, 61, (1978); Furell G., Hjemdahl P., Fredholm B., On the mechanism by which antiadrenergic drugs increase survival of critical skin flaps, Plast Reconstr Surg, 72, (1983); In M., Su C., Hoopes J., Anthenelli R., Skin flap metabolism in rats: Oxygen consumption and lactate production, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 71, (1983); Jurell G., Hjendahl P., Fredholm B., On the mechanism by which antiadrenergic drugs increase survival of critical skin flaps, Plast Reconstr Surg, 72, (1983); Katz A., Hayes W., Messineo F., Pappano H., Cellular actions in pharmacology of the calcium blocking drugs, Am J Med, 79, 4, (1985); Kerrigan C., Daniel R., Critical ischemia time and the failing skin flap, Plast Reconstr Surg, 69, (1982); Kerrigan C., Daniel R., Pharmacologic treatment of the failing skin flap, Plast Reconstr Surg, 72, (1982); Kerrigan C., Skin flap failure: pathophysiology, Plast Reconstr Surg, 72, (1983); Kerrigan C., Daniel R., Skin flap research: a candid review, Ann Plast Surg, 18, (1984); Koehnlein H., Lemperle G., Experimental studies on the effect of DMSO on pedicle flaps, Surgery, 67, (1980); Miller A., Falcone R., Nappi J., Et al., The lack of effect of nifedipine on failing skin flaps, J Dermatol Surg, 11, (1985); Monteiro D., Santamore W., Nemir P., The influence of pentoxifylline on skin flap survival, Plast Reconstr Surg, 77, (1986); Myers M., Cherry G., Causes of necrosis in pedicle flaps, Plast Reconstr Surg, 42, (1968); Nichter L., Sobieski M., Edgerton M., Efficacy of topical nitroglycerin for random-pattern skin flap salvage, Plast Reconstr Surg, 75, (1985); Nichter L., Sobieski M., Efficacy of verapamil on the salvage of failing random skin flaps, Ann Plast Surg, 21, (1988); Pearl R., A unifying theory of the delay phenomenon, Annals of Plastic Surgery, 7, (1981); Reinisch J., The pathophysiology of skin flap circulation: the delay phenomenon, Plast Reconstr Surg, 54, (1974); Rohrich R., Cherry G., Spira M., Enhancement of skin flap survival using nitroglycerin ointment, Plast Reconstr Surg, 73, (1984); Sagi A., Ferder M., Levens D., Strauch B., Improved survival of island flaps after prolonged ischemia by perfusion with superoxide dismutase, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 77, (1986); Sasaki A., Harii K., Lack of effect of isoxuprine on experimental random flaps in the rat, Plast Reconstr Surg, 66, (1980); Sasaki G., Pang C., Experimental evidence for involvement of prostaglandins in viability of acute skin flaps: effects on viability and mode of action, Plast Reconstr Surg, 67, (1981); Takayanagi S., Ogawa Y., Effects of pentoxifylline on flap survival, Plast Reconstr Surg, 65, (1980); Tsur H., Daniller A., Strauch B., Neovascularization of skin flaps: route and timing, Plast Reconstr Surg, 66, (1980); Yessenow R., Maves M., Effects of Oxypherol-ET on random skin flap survival of the swine model, Arch Otolaryngol, 114, (1988); Yessenow R., Maves M., The effects of pentoxilylline on random skin flap survival, Arch Otolaryngol, 115, (1989); Young C., The revascularization of pedicle skin flaps in pigs: a functional and morphological study, Plast Reconstr Surg, 70, (1982)","","","Springer-Verlag","","","","","","14350130","","EJPSE","","English","Eur J Plast Surg","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026101834"

However, examinations of associations between exposure to agricultural tasks and hearing loss are limited. Methods: Audiometry and lifetime exposure to 11 agricultural tasks were analyzed among 1,568 participants. Gender stratified multivariable linear regression was used to estimate associations between exposure duration and three hearing loss metrics. Results: Among men, significant associations were observed between hearing loss and hunting or target shooting, all-terrain vehicle (ATV) or motorcycle riding, chain saw use, electric or pneumatic tool use, living on a farm, and all agricultural tasks combined. When all significant exposure metrics were included in a single model, associations remained for hunting or target shooting, electric or pneumatic tool use and living on a farm. Significant associations were sparse among women, and in all cases paradoxical. Conclusions: Despite imprecise estimation of noise exposure, specific agricultural tasks were associated with hearing loss. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Agricultural health; Hearing loss; Noise; Occupational health; Risk factors","Agriculture; Audiometry; Female; Firearms; Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Prospective Studies; Task Performance and Analysis; agriculture; article; audiometry; female; firearm; human; male; middle aged; noise injury; occupational disease; occupational exposure; occupational health; prospective study; statistical model; task performance","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (T42OH008491)","","American National Standard: Specification for audiometers, (1996); American National Standard: Determination of occupational noise exposure and estimation of noise-induced hearing impairment, (1996); Axelsson A., Prasher D., Tinnitus induced by occupational and leisure noise, Noise Health, 2, 8, pp. 47-54, (2000); Beckett W.S., Chamberlain D., Hallman E., May J., Hwang S.A., Gomez M., Eberly S., Cox C., Stark A., Hearing conservation for farmers: Source apportionment of occupational and environmental factors contributing to hearing loss, J Occup Environ Med, 42, 8, (2000); Brackbill R.M., Cameron L.L., Behrens V., Prevalence of chronic diseases and impairments among US farmers, 1986-1990, Am J Epidemiol, 139, 11, pp. 1055-1065, (1994); Broste S.K., Hansen D.A., Strand R.L., Stueland D.T., Hearing loss among high school farm students, Am J Public Health, 79, 5, pp. 619-622, (1989); Choi S.W., Peek-Asa C., Sprince N.L., Rautiainen R.H., Donham K.J., Flamme G.A., Whitten P.S., Zwerling C., Hearing loss as a risk factor for agricultural injuries, Am J Ind Med, 48, 4, pp. 293-301, (2005); Crawford J.M., Hoppin J.A., Alavanja M.C., Blair A., Sandler D.P., Kamel F., Hearing loss among licensed pesticide applicators in the agricultural health study, Occup Environ Med, 50, 7, pp. 817-826, (2008); Flamme G.A., Mudipalli V.R., Reynolds S.J., Kelly K.M., Stromquist A.M., Zwerling C., Burmeister L.F., Peng S.C., Merchant J.A., Prevalence of hearing impairment in a rural Midwestern cohort: Estimates from the Keokuk County rural health study, 1994 to 1998, Ear Hearing, 26, 3, pp. 350-360, (2005); Gates D.M., Jones M.S., A pilot study to prevent hearing loss in farmers, Public Health Nurs, 24, 6, pp. 547-553, (2007); Gomez M.I., Hwang S.A., Sobotova L., Stark A.D., May J.J., A comparison of self-reported hearing loss and audiometry in a cohort of New York farmers, J Speech Lang Hear Res, 44, 6, pp. 1201-1208, (2001); Hwang S.A., Gomez M.I., Sobotova L., Stark A.D., May J.J., Hallman E.M., Predictors of hearing loss in New York farmers, Am J Ind Med, 40, 1, pp. 23-31, (2001); International standards organization: Determination of occupational noise exposure and estimation of noise-induced hearing impairment, (1990); Karlovich R.S., Wiley T.L., Tweed T., Jensen D.V., Hearing sensitivity in farmers, Public Health Rep, 103, 1, pp. 61-71, (1988); Knobloch M.J., Broste S.K., A hearing conservation program for Wisconsin youth working in agriculture, J Sch Health, 68, 8, pp. 313-318, (1998); Marvel M.E., Pratt D.S., Marvel L.H., Regan M., May J., Occupational hearing loss in New York dairy farmers, Am J Ind Med, 20, 4, pp. 517-531, (1991); May J.J., Marvel M., Regan M., Marvel L.H., Pratt D.S., Noise-induced hearing loss in randomly selected New York dairy farmers, Am J Ind Med, 18, 3, pp. 333-337, (1990); McBride D.I., Firth H.M., Herbison G.P., Noise exposure and hearing loss in agriculture: A survey of farmers and farm workers in the southland region of New Zealand, J Occup Environ Med, 45, 12, pp. 1281-1288, (2003); Merchant J.A., Stromquist A.M., Kelly K.M., Zwerling C., Reynolds S.J., Burmeister L.F., Chronic disease and injury in an agricultural county: The Keokuk County Rural Health Cohort Study, J Rural Health, 18, 4, pp. 521-535, (2002); Criteria for a Recommended Standard, Occupational Noise Exposure, Revised Criteria 1998.

We describe an improved method of delivery involving a perforated concentric envelope enclosing a tissue expander (type 2) in place of the single circumferential perforated catheter (type 1) used previously by us. Eleven guinea pigs received a type 1 expander and ten received a type 2 expander. The anticonctractile agent theophylline was delivered in saline around each expander, and all the expanders from both groups were inflated to a similar pressure every three days for twelve days. Significantly greater expansion, in terms of total volume delivered to the expander, was noted using the type 2 expander. We conclude that the concentric device offers further improvement, probably as a result of more uniform distribution of the agent in the tissue around the expander.","","Animal; Fibroblasts; Guinea Pigs; Skin; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Theophylline; Tissue Expanders; theophylline; animal experiment; article; device; guinea pig; nonhuman; skin; tissue expansion","","Theophylline, 58-55-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01487043","","APCSD","2353782","English","ANN.

We also were interested in determining whether demineralized perforated bone matrix implants from membranous bone have greater osseoinductive capacity in the calvarial area than demineralized perforated bone matrix implants from endochondral bone. Forty 12-week-old purebred beagles were used. Group I consisted o f animals with unrepaired surgically created calvarial defects healed by secondary intention (n = 10). Group II consisted o f animals with surgically created calvarial defects in which the bone was removed and replaced with an autograft ( n = 10). Group III consisted o f animals with surgically created calvarial defects in which the bony defect was closed with a demineralized perforated bone matrix implant obtained from beagle calvaria (n = 10). Group IV consisted o f animals with surgically created calvarial defects in which the bony defect was closed with a demineralized perforated bone matrix implant obtained from beagle tìbia (n = 10). The two control groups (I and II) allowed us to isolate the inductive capacity o f demineralized perforated bone matrix implants and compare it with the healing o f the bone defects left unrepaired or repaired with calvarial autografts. Animals were sacrificed after 8 and 12 weeks. In the present study we were able to verify that demineralized perforated bone matrix implants are well accepted in the calvarial defects with little tissue reaction and remarkably little osteoclastic activity. In arguing for the osseoinductive potential o f demineralized perforated bone, we must realize that it is likely that much o f the bone consists o f demineralized implant that has been invaded by host cells along with new bone in the area o f the implant. This study revealed no statistically significant differences between new bone formation following the insertion o f demineralized perforated bone matrix implants o f the tibia or calvarium. © 1995 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.","","Animal; Bone Demineralization Technique; Bone Regeneration; Bone Transplantation; Dogs; Female; Skull; Tibia; Time Factors; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bone matrix; cranioplasty; demineralization; dog; nonhuman; ossification; priority journal; skull defect; skull development; surgical technique","","","","","","","Salyer K., Gudmundsen A., Facial Balance and Harmony Through the Use of Split Bone Techniques, Aesthetic Contouring of the Craniomaxillofadal Skeleton, pp. 333-346; Constantino P.D., Friedman C.D., Jones K., Chow L.C., Sisson G.A., Experimental hydroxyapatite cement cranioplasty, Plast.

Rollover protective structures (ROPS) and seatbelts effectively reduce tractor overturn deaths. However, a large proportion of tractors in use in American agriculture are older tractors without ROPS and seatbelts. This article describes the tractor-related responses from participants in a population-based study conducted in Keokuk County, Iowa. This study was designed to measure rural and agricultural adverse health and injury outcomes and their respective risk factors. Questionnaires were partially developed from well-documented national surveys. Questions about agricultural machinery use, presence of safety equipment on the machinery, work practices, and attitudes about farm safety were included. Study participants on farms who owned tractors had an average of 3.1 tractors with an average age of 27 years. Only 39% of the 665 tractors had ROPS. Tractor age was associated with the presence of ROPS; 84% of tractors manufactured after 1984 were ROPS-equipped, whereas only 3% of tractors manufactured before 1960 were ROPS-equipped. ROPS-equipped tractors were significantly more common on larger farms and households with higher income. Only 4% of the farmers reported that their tractors had seatbelts and they wore them when operating their tractors. The results of this study support the findings of other studies, which indicate that many older tractors without ROPS and seatbelts remain in use in American agriculture. Until a dramatic reduction in the number of tractors in the U.S. operated without ROPS and seatbelts is achieved, the annual incidence of 120 to 130 deaths associated with tractor overturns will persist. © 2006 ASABE.","Agricultural fatalities; Agricultural machinery safety; Rollover Protective Structures; ROPS; Seatbelt usage; Tractor overturns","Accidents, Occupational; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Agriculture; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Equipment Design; Equipment Safety; Female; Humans; Infant; Injury Severity Score; Iowa; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Vehicles; Safety; Seat Belts; Wounds and Injuries; adolescent; adult; aged; agriculture; article; cause of death; child; economics; equipment; equipment design; female; human; infant; injury; injury scale; instrumentation; male; middle aged; mortality; motor vehicle; occupational accident; preschool child; safety; seatbelt; statistics; United States","","","","","","","Brown M., Parker D., Seeland E., Boyle D., Wahl G., Five years of work-related injuries and fatalities in Minnesota Agriculture: A high-risk industry, Minnesota Med., 80, pp. 29-32, (1997); Census of fatal occupational injuries summary, 2004, (2003); Public health focus: Effectiveness of rollover protective structures for preventing injuries associated with agricultural tractors, MMWR, 42, 3, pp. 57-59, (1993); Fatalities associated with improper hitching to farm tractors: New York, 1991-1995, MMWR, 45, 15, pp. 307-311, (1996); Goudy W., Burke S.C., Iowa's counties: Selected population trends, vital statistics, and socioeconomic data, (1991); Hallman E.M., ROPS retrofitting: Measuring effectiveness of incentives and uncovering inherent barriers to success, J.

Other factors, however, may contribute to the development of this condition. During the past decade, we have seen a number of infants whose deformities seem to be associated with the extended use of car seats, infant carriers, bouncy seats, and infant swings. Having recognized that notes about usage were being routinely recorded in the margins of our clinical records, we began collecting information on the amount of time infants were spending in these devices. In this report, we describe our findings and document the related cranial deformities. The data and photographs were collected between 1998 and 2000 and reviewed to determine the amount of time children with deformational plagiocephaly spent in these devices. During the three-year study period, 56.6% of the infants spent less than 1.5 hrs, 28. 6% spent 1.5 to 4 hrs, and 14.8% spent more than 4 hrs/day in these devices. In addition, 5.7% slept in one of these devices during their first several months of life, frequently because of problems with reflux. These infants often developed an increase in posterior head height and ""squaring"" or ""cornering"" of the head. Normal use of car seats, carriers, swings and bouncy seats is not a concern; however, caution is warranted for infants who spend extended periods of time in these devices. The constant pressure these devices apply to the back of the cranium may perpetuate the deformation.","Car seat; Deformation; Etiology; Infant carrier; Plagiocephaly","article; child care; device; head position; height; human; medical record; photography; plagiocephaly; pressure; skull defect; sleep; statistical significance","","","","","","","American Academy of Pediatrics AAP Task Force on Infant Positioning and SIDS: Positioning and SIDS, Pediatrics, 89, pp. 1120-1126, (1992); Argenta L., David L., Wilson J., Bell W., An increase in infant cranial deformity with supine sleeping position, J Craniofac Surg, 7, pp. 5-11, (1996); Kane A., Mitchell L., Craven K., Marsh J., Observations on a recent increase in plagiocephaly without synostosis, Pediatrics, 97, pp. 877-885, (1996); Littlefield T.R., Beals S.P., Manwaring K.M., Pomatto J.K., Joganic E.F., Golden K.A., Ripley C.E., Treatment of craniofacial asymmetry with dynamic orthotic cranioplasty, J Craniofac Surg, 9, pp. 11-17, (1998); Turk A., McCarthy J., Thorne C., Wisoff J., The ""Back to Sleep Campaign"" and deformational plagiocephaly: Is there a cause for concern?, J Craniofac Surg, 7, pp. 12-18, (1996); Bruneteau R., Mulliken J., Frontal plagiocephaly: Synostotic, compensation, or deformational, Plast Reconstr Surg, 89, pp. 21-31, (1992); Mulliken J.B., Vander Woude D.L., Hansen M., LaBrie R.A., Scott R.M., Analysis of posterior plagiocephaly: Deformational versus synostotic, Plast Reconstr Surg, 103, pp. 371-380, (1999); Littlefield T.R., Kelly K.M., Pomatto J.K., Beals S.P., Multiple birth infants at higher risk for development of deformational plagiocephaly, Pediatrics, 103, pp. 565-569, (1999); Littlefield T.R., Kelly K.M., Pomatto J.K., Beals S.P., Multiple-birth infants at higher risk for development of deformational plagiocephaly II: Is one twin at greater risk?, Pediatrics, 109, pp. 19-25, (2002); Havens D.H., Zink R.L., The ""Back to Sleep"" campaign, J Pediatr Health Care, 8, pp. 240-242, (1994); Crisis to Progress: Five Years of Air Bag Safety in America, Section 11.

The complexity and severity of the defect require an unusual degree of cooperation among all specialists and especially between the surgeon and the orthodontist. There are no published findings that we know about in which comprehensive data from a number of disciplines are reported for the same group of bilateral cleft patients. Fifty randomly selected patients with bilateral complete clefts were examined by the Iowa team and two orthodontists from other institutions. The evaluations revealed that a large number of patients over the age of 10 have multiple residual problems requiring further treatment. Only 23 percent of the older patients studied were judged to have had treatment completed by the surgeon, speech pathologist, and orthodontist. It is very difficult to state whether the results obtained by our team can be considered satisfactory because there are no comparable studies that have attempted to evaluate the same parameters in multidisciplinary management. © 1992 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.","","Adolescent; Adult; Case Report; Cephalometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Cleft Lip; Cleft Palate; Female; Human; Male; Patient Care Team; Reoperation; Surgery, Plastic; Treatment Outcome; adolescent; adult; article; cephalometry; child; cleft lip; cleft palate; clinical article; female; human; male; orthodontics; otorhinolaryngology; priority journal; speech therapy; surgeon; surgical technique","","","","","","","Bardach J., Morris H., Olin W., McDermott-Murray J., Mooney M., Bardach E., Late results of mul-tidisciplinary management of unilateral cleft lip and palate, Ann.

These congeners are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes to potentially neurotoxic hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs). The present study explores the enantioselective disposition and toxicity of 2 environmentally relevant, neurotoxic PCB congeners and their OH-PCB metabolites in lactating mice and their offspring following dietary exposure of the dam. Female C57BL/6N mice (8-weeks old) were fed daily, beginning 2 weeks prior to conception and continuing throughout gestation and lactation, with 3.1 mmol/kg bw/d of racemic 2,20,3,50,6- pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 95) or 2,20,3,30,6,60-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 136) in peanut butter; controls received vehicle (peanut oil) in peanut butter. PCB 95 levels were higher than PCB 136 levels in both dams and pups, consistent with the more rapid metabolism of PCB 136 compared with PCB 95. In pups and dams, both congeners were enriched for the enantiomer eluting second on enantioselective gas chromatography columns. OH-PCB profiles in lactating mice and their offspring were complex and varied according to congener, tissue and age. Developmental exposure to PCB 95 versus PCB 136 differentially affected the expression of P450 enzymes as well as neural plasticity (arc and ppp1r9b) and thyroid hormone-responsive genes (nrgn and mbp). The results suggest that the enantioselective metabolism of PCBs to OH-PCBs may influence neurotoxic outcomes following developmental exposures, a hypothesis that warrants further investigation. ©.","Atropisomer; Chiral; Cytochrome P450 enzymes; Metabolites; Persistent organic pollutants; Plasticity; Polychlorinated biphenyls","Animals; Chromatography, Gas; Female; Lactation; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nervous System; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Stereoisomerism; Teratogens; 2,2',3,3',6,6' hexachlorobiphenyl; 2,2',3,5',6 pentachlorobiphenyl; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 1A2; cytochrome p450 2b10; cytochrome P450 3A11; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; thyroid hormone; unclassified drug; polychlorinated biphenyl; teratogenic agent; adult; animal tissue; Article; brain level; brain weight; carcass; chirality; conception; controlled study; developmental toxicity; enantiomer; enantioselectivity; female; gas chromatography; gene expression; kidney mass; lactation; male; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; pregnancy; progeny; animal; C57BL mouse; drug effect; nervous system; stereoisomerism","","cytochrome P450, 9035-51-2; Polychlorinated Biphenyls, ; Teratogens, ","","","Southwest Environmental Health Sciences Center; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (ES005605, ES007059, ES011269, ES013661, ES014901, ES023513, ES06694); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (R01ES017425); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, (RD83543201); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This work was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Science at the National Institute of Health (ES005605 and ES013661 to H-J.L., ES014901, ES023513 and ES011269 to P.J.L., ES017425 to H-J.L. and P.J.L., ES007059 to C.B.); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (RD83543201 to P.J.L.); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (14 April 2017 to S.M.B.); and Advancing Science in America (ARCS) Fellowship (to C.B.).

Using 62 beagle puppies as subjects, we tested the hypothesis that raising mucoperiosteal flaps does not interfere with craniofacial growth. We further hypothesized that the size of the area of bone exposed following palatoplasty does affect subsequent craniofacial growth. The animals were divided into four groups: two control groups (unoperated and unrepaired) and two experimental groups. In the first experimental group, two-flap palatoplasty was used to close the surgically induced palatal defect, leaving narrow strips (0 to 2.5 mm) of bone exposed lateral to the flaps. In the second group, one flap was raised to close the defect, leaving a wide area (5 to 6 mm) of palatal bone exposed on one side. Thirty-four direct craniometric measurements were analyzed. Animals that had elevation of both mucoperiosteal flaps with narrow strips of denuded bone on both sides had less severe craniofacial growth aberrations than those in which the defect was left unrepaired or was repaired with one mucoperiosteal flap leaving a wider area of bare bone exposed. These findings suggest that raising mucoperiosteal flaps is less detrimental to craniofacial growth than leaving large areas of exposed palatal bone. © 1990 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.","","Analysis of Variance; Animal; Craniometry; Dogs; Facial Bones; Female; Male; Mandible; Maxilla; Palate; Periosteum; Random Allocation; Skull; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Surgical Flaps; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; etiology; face growth; palate; palatoplasty; periosteum; priority journal","","","","","","","Bardach J., Rozsczepy Wargi Gorneji Podneibienia, (1967); Mapes A.H., Mazaheri M., Harding R.L., Et al., A longitudinal analysis of the maxillary growth increments of cleft lip and palate patients (CLP), Cleft Palate J, 11, (1974); Krogman W.M., Mazaheri M., Harding R.L., Et al., A longitudinal study of the craniofacial growth pattern in children with clefts as opposed to normal, birth to 6 years, Cleft Palate J, 12, (1975); Robertson N.R., Fish J., Early dimensional changes in the arches of cleft palate children, Am.

Interventions that address the promotion of health and well-being in addition to traditional occupational safety and health hazards, a Total Worker Health® (TWH) approach, may be effective in reducing injuries and preventing illness. However, little research has examined the impact of TWH interventions in small enterprises. The aim of this research was to explore and characterize health and safety practices, policies, and programs in small Midwestern enterprises from a TWH perspective. Utilizing a case studies approach, site visits were conducted with small business, between 10 and 250 employees, from 2014 through 2016 and included workplace audits and interviews with multiple employees in varying roles within each organization. Both open and closed coding were used to identify specific themes. Eight themes emerged from the site visits: Value and return on investment, organizational factors, program design, engaging employees, low-cost strategies, evaluation, and integration. These themes overlapped with both the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Essential Elements of TWH and the NIOSH Fundamentals. Industry sector and enterprise size also affect resources and integration of these resources. As TWH expands to organizations of all sizes, it is necessary to address the unique needs of smaller enterprises. © The Author(s) 2018.","occupational safety; small business; total worker health; wellness","Health Promotion; Humans; Industry; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Small Business; United States; Workplace; Costs; Diseases; Health hazards; Personnel; Low-cost strategies; National institute for occupational safety and healths; Occupational safety; Occupational safety and health; Organizational factors; Return on investments; Small business; wellness; article; employee; human; interview; investment; occupational health service; organization; worker; workplace; commercial phenomena; health promotion; industry; occupational exposure; occupational health; prevention and control; United States; Occupational risks","","","","","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, (U19OH008868)","","Anger W.K., Elliot D.L., Bodner T., Et al., Effectiveness of total worker health interventions, J Occup Health Psychol, 20, pp. 226-247, (2015); Antonsson A.B., Birgersdotter L., Bornberger-Dankvardt S., Small Enterprises in Sweden: Health and Safety and the Significance of Intermediaries in Preventive Health, (2002); Bowen M., Morara M., Mureithi S., Management of business challenges among small and micro enterprises in Nairobi-Kenya, KCA J Bus Manag, 2, pp. 16-31, (2009); Bradley C.J., Grossman D.C., Hubbard R.A., Et al., Integrated interventions for improving total worker health: A panel report from the National Institutes of Health Pathways to Prevention Workshop: Total worker health-What's work got to do with it?, Ann Intern Med, 165, pp. 279-283, (2016); Champoux D., Brun J.-P., Occupational health and safety management in small size enterprises: An overview of the situation and avenues for intervention and research, Safety Science, 41, pp. 301-318, (2003); Cunningham T.R., Sinclair R., Application of a model for delivering occupational safety and health to smaller businesses: Case studies from the US, Saf Sci, 71, pp. 213-225, (2015); Gardner D., Carlopio J., Fonteyn P.N., Et al., Mechanical equipment injuries in small manufacturing businesses.

This report focuses on the outcomes of personal protective equipment (PPE) usage among one cohort of 438 Iowa (owner-operator) farmers in the Certified Safe Farm study during a 5-year period from 2004 to 2008. Intervention farmers reported an 11% increase in regular respirator usage and a 23% increase in regular use of hearing protection relative to comparison groups. Furthermore, it was revealed that personal factors such as smoking and low self-assessment of health status are associated with lower usage of PPE. The authors provide evidence that multiple modalities of intervention are more likely to affect safe behavior changes in the owner-operator farming population compared with single modality interventions. Further, farmers reported that personal factors such as smoking history and low self-assessment of health status are associated with lower usage of PPE. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agriculture; intervention; personal protective equipment (PPE)","Adult; Aged; Agricultural Workers' Diseases; Cohort Studies; Ear Protective Devices; Female; Humans; Iowa; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Occupational Health; Protective Devices; Respiratory Protective Devices; Self-Assessment; Smoking; adult; aged; article; cohort analysis; ear protective device; evaluation study; female; gas mask; human; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; occupational disease; occupational health; protective equipment; self evaluation; smoking; United States; utilization review","","","","","Iowa Farm Bureau Federation; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, (U01-0H008110-02, U07-OH07548-04)","Kelley J.

A potential risk factor contributing to occupational injuries across all industries is acute or chronic co-morbidity (e.g., obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol), and related health issues that increase the risk for an occupational injury or illness. These chronic health conditions have been associated not only with increased risk for injuries, but also higher health-care costs, and greater absenteeism. Certified Safe Farm (CSF) is a comprehensive intervention program aimed to reduce occupational health and safety hazards and to promote general health among farmers. Prior publications have described CSF program efforts to reduce hazardous exposures, disabling injuries, organic dust toxic syndrome, occupational health-care costs, and to increase positive occupational health behaviors. This paper reports on the general health indicators of a cohort of 438 Iowa farm owner/operators enrolled in the CSF program. Overall, this study found that the farming population in Iowa has higher body mass index (BMI), but lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lower prevalence of hypertension compared to the general population. There was evidence that the combination of high blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI were related to increased injury rates. Poor self-reported health status was also related to increased injuries but was not related to clinical health indicators. The CSF intervention led to improvements on health outcomes, particularly among those in the 35 to 49 age group. Little research has focused on the individual’s general health status as a predictor of risk of occupational injury. This study suggests the need for additional research and interventions integrating occupational safety and health prevention along with health promotion. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Agriculture;

Data are from the U.S. Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index (2010–2012), a nationally representative telephone survey of U.S. workers (n = 412,884). The independent variable was the response to a work environment (WE) question as to whether their supervisor always creates an open and trusting environment. Regression models were adjusted for demographic characteristics with each of the LS7 CVD risk factors as dependent variables. Twenty-one percent of workers reported that their supervisor did not create an open and trusting environment. Trust was associated with increased adjusted odds of having many of the LS7 CVD risk factors. Among those workers whose supervisor created a mistrustful environment, the odds ratios were greatest (>20%) for having four or more of the LS7 CVD risk factors. © 2019 by the authors.

Hlth., C., University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States","In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended supine sleeping to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Although the incidence of deformational plagiocephaly is unknown, the consensus is that it has increased since this recommendation was made. To estimate the current incidence of plagiocephaly, we examined 342 infants for signs of deformational plagiocephaly, including occipital flattening, ear misalignment, frontal bossing, and facial asymmetry. Noticeable occipital flattening was documented in 15.2% of the infants (95% confidence interval, 11.6% to 19.5%); 1.46% had significant cranial deformities that also affected the skull base and face. Significant cranial asymmetry, defined as occipital flattening with concomitant skull base involvement and facial asymmetry, was observed in almost 1 in 68 infants. Adding to a growing body of evidence, our findings suggest significant increases in clinical deformational plagiocephaly since initiation of the AAP's ""Back to Sleep"" campaign. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The study includes in-depth evaluations of respiratory disease, injury, and other health outcomes in relation to environmental and occupational exposures. This article reports descriptive findings on pesticide use from among the 1191 participants completing occupational surveys. Fifty-one percent (612) of respondents (farmers and non-farmers) had applied insecticides including lawn and garden chemicals at home during the past year. Thirty-three percent (395) of respondents had personally mixed or applied farm chemicals during their life. One-hundred and four had a current pesticide applicator's license. Information on the specific types of pesticides and protective measures used was obtained for the 144 individuals who had mixed or applied pesticides on farms within the previous year. Of these individuals, 67% worked with fertilizers, 49% used herbicides, 48% used crop insecticides, 28% used crop storage insecticides, 45% applied livestock insecticides, and 9% worked with fungicides. The use of personal protective equipment such as gloves, aprons, and respirators varied depending on the chemical. A substantial proportion did not use gloves even for mixing. Thirty-five percent reported at least one suspected work-related symptom after working with pesticides during the previous year. The lack of differences in protective equipment use between applicators who have completed pesticide applicator training courses and those who have not suggests a need to develop more effective training methods. The increased use of protective equipment when applying odorous agrochemicals suggests that addition of an odorant to more toxic pesticides may be a successful intervention strategy. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Methods: From May to October, 25 adolescents ages 13 through 17, living either on a farm or a rural nonfarm, were enrolled in the study. Subjects received training on the correct operation and use of personal noise dosimeters and the proper way to record their daily tasks on activity cards. Subjects completed 4 days of self-monitoring noise dosimetry, 2 days in the first round (May-July) and 2 days in the second round (August-October). In addition to dosimetry, subjects completed activity logs of their daily tasks. Results: The mean daily noise exposures of adolescents living on farms and in nonfarm rural homes were between 55.4 dBA (A-weighted decibels) and 103.5 dBA, with 44% of the daily measurements greater than the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Recommended Exposure Level of 85 dBA. Task-based analysis of noise exposures found that activities involving mechanized equipment resulted in the highest exposures, while activities in the home resulted in the lowest exposure. No particular demographic group had a statistically higher noise exposure; therefore, specific factors apart from activities and noise sources could not be identified as risk factors for exposure to hazardous noise levels. Conclusions: The results of this project indicate that rural adolescents complete a variety of activities and are exposed to noise sources with a broad range of decibel levels. While the exposures may change from day to day, there are occasions when exposure to noise exceeds the recommended levels. © 2010 National Rural Health Association.","Adolescents; Exposure assessment;

Objective: In this study, we investigated whether subpectoral placement of mammary implants negatively affects the strength performance (SP) of the PMM. Methods: Twenty women underwent isokinetic testing with the Biodex 3 System (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc, Shirley, NY) before surgery and 2 and 6 weeks after subpectoral placement of breast implants. Nine patients returned for long-term testing. To isolate the PMM, we tested two motions: internal rotation and extension/adduction. The results were evaluated in two ways. We compared postoperative SP to baseline (preoperative) SP using paired Student t tests. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SP was also evaluated with the Biodex 3 System Standards, which consider a postoperative SP of less than 75% of baseline significantly impaired and one more than 75% to be within normal limits. Results: Paired comparisons indicated statistically significant reductions in SP 2 weeks after surgery, followed by increases in SP by 6 weeks. When applying the Biodex 3 System Standards, we found that in both internal rotation and extension/adduction, nearly half of the patients had recovered to 75% of baseline SP 2 weeks after surgery and that more than three- quarters of the patients were fully recovered 6 weeks after surgery. Long-term follow-up in 9 patients revealed retention of SP or further improvement. Conclusions: Subpectoral placement of mammary implants did not produce statistically significant long-term loss of upper-extremity SP. It appears that no permanent loss of strength of the PMM results from subpectoral placement of breast implants.","","adult; arm movement; article; breast augmentation; breast endoprosthesis; clinical article; controlled study; convalescence; device; exercise test; female; follow up; functional assessment; human; human tissue; isokinetic exercise; isolation procedure; joint mobility; muscle function; muscle strength; muscle weakness; pectoralis major muscle; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; reference value; statistical significance; Student t test; surgical technique; time","","","Biodex 3 System, Biodex, United States","Biodex, United States","","","Dempsey W.C., Latham W.D., Subpectoral implants in augmentation mammaplasty, Plast.

Inappropriate use of pesticides increases the health risk to those who work with or live around pesticides. Educational programs for agricultural workers on the proper use of pesticides and personal protective equipment coupled with pesticide regulations are important tools to reduce the associated health risks. The authors conducted a survey (N = 2336) on pesticide use practices in the Ararat Valley of Armenia in 2000-2006. This study was a cross-sectional design. A multistage sampling method was implemented in the selection of the study population. The authors developed a questionnaire containing 173 questions to evaluate demographic characteristics, health conditions, and details of pesticides use practices. The intensity of pesticide use was high; 82.8% of respondents used them. More than 150 brand names of pesticides were in use. Unregistered, obsolete, expired, and banned compounds were found in active use. Poor compliance with the basic rules of pesticide safety was found throughout the study population, with 21.3% using gloves and only 11% using respirators. The agricultural workers' knowledge of the toxic properties of these pesticides as well as basic hygienic norms was very low. In some instances, the number of agrichemical applications to crops, particularly cucumbers and melons, reached 40 applications during the growing season. Better protection and training of pesticide users in Armenia is needed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Education; health; personal protective equipment; pesticide; safety","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Agriculture; Armenia; Data Collection; Female; Gloves, Protective; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Pesticides; Protective Clothing; Rural Health; pesticide; adolescent; adult; aged; agriculture; Armenia; article; female; health; human; information processing; male; middle aged; occupational health; protective clothing; utilization review","","","","","Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health; Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health, (U50 OH07548); National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, (U54OH010162); U.S. Department of State, DOS; University of Nebraska Medical Center, UNMC; Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, ECA; University of Iowa, UI","This research was funded by grants from the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, US Department of State, NIOSH grant to The University of Iowa, Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health (U50 OH07548), and NIOSH grant to the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (U54 OH010162).

We studied a cohort of rural Iowa children to determine the association between farm and other environmental risk factors with four asthma outcomes: doctor-diagnosed asthma, doctor-diagnosed asthma/medication for wheeze, current wheeze, and cough with exercise. Doctor-diagnosed asthma prevalence was 12%, but at least one of these four health outcomes was found in more than a third of the cohort. Multivariable models of the four health outcomes found independent associations between male sex (three asthma outcomes), age (three asthma outcomes), a personal history of allergies (four asthma outcomes), family history of allergic disease (two asthma outcomes), premature birth (one asthma outcome), early respiratory infection (three asthma outcomes), high-risk birth (two asthma outcomes), and farm exposure to raising swine and adding antibiotics to feed (two asthma outcomes). The high prevalence of rural childhood asthma and asthma symptoms underscores the need for asthma screening programs and improved asthma diagnosis and treatment. The high prevalence of asthma health outcomes among farm children living on farms that raise swine (44.1%, p = 0.01) and raise swine and add antibiotics to feed (55.8%, p = 0.013), despite lower rates of atopy and personal histories of allergy, suggests the need for awareness and prevention measures and more population-based studies to further assess environmental and genetic determinants of asthma among farm children.","Agricultural occupational exposures; Ammonia; Animal feeding operations; Asthma; Asthma diagnosis and treatment; Asthma health care policy; Asthma school screening; Asthma underdiagnosis; Asthma undertreatment; Children; Chronic wheeze; Cough with exercise; Farming; Genetic selection; Hydrogen sulfide; Hygiene hypothesis; Odor; Rural","Adolescent; Agriculture; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Epidemiologic Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Iowa; Male; Models, Theoretical; Respiratory Function Tests; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Treatment Outcome; Animalia; Sus scrofa; antibiotic agent; allergy; article; asthma; atopy; blood sampling; child; childhood disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; coughing; environmental exposure; environmental factor; epidemiological data; exercise; family history; feeding; female; heredity; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; mass screening; pig farming; prematurity; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; respiratory tract infection; risk factor; rural area; sex difference; United States; wheezing","","","","","","","Anto J.M., Methods to assess and quantify BHR (bronchial hyperresponsiveness) in epidemiological studies, Clin.

The goals of the KCRHS are to prospectively describe, measure, and analyze prevalent rural and agriculturally related adverse health outcomes and their respective risk factors and to provide the basis for future community-based intervention programs to reduce disease and injury incidence. Methods of data collection included in-person interviews, medical screenings, and environmental assessments of homes and farms. All households studied were rural; comparisons were made among farm, rural nonfarm, and town households, between men and women, and between smokers and nonsmokers. The present paper reports selected adult baseline data from Round 1 of this study. Residents of farm households were somewhat younger and better educated than residents of rural nonfarm and town households; smoked less; were more likely to have ridden an all-terrain vehicle; and were more likely to report firearms in the home. Eighty-nine percent of the men and 66% of the women engaged in farming or did so in the past. Men more often reported hearing loss, were more often overweight and obese, more often reported an injury, less often reported asthma, and less often saw a medical practitioner. Women reported poorer emotional health and higher rates of depression symptoms. The KCRHS has identified several modifiable health outcomes and risk factors as candidates for further analysis and targets for community-based prevention and intervention programs.","","adult; aged; agricultural worker; agriculture; article; asthma; chronic disease; community care; controlled study; demography; depression; environmental factor; female; firearm; health program; health status; hearing loss; household; human; injury; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; mental health; obesity; risk factor; rural health care; sex ratio; smoking","","","","","","","Respiratory health hazards in agriculture, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 158, 5, (1998); Armstrong P.S., Schulman M.D., Financial strain and depression among farm operators: The role of perceived economic hardship and personal control, Rural Sociology, 55, 4, pp. 475-493, (1990); Baker S.P., O'Neill B., Ginsburg M.J., Li G., Injury fact book (2nd ed.), (1992); Beckett W.S., Chamberlain D., Hallman E., May J., Hwang S.A., Gomez M., Eberly S., Cox C., Stark A., Hearing conversation for farmers: Source apportionment of occupational and environmental factors contributing to hearing loss, Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 42, 8, pp. 806-813, (2000); Berkman L.F., Syme S.L., Social networks, host resistance, and mortality: A nine-year follow-up study of Alameda County residents, American Journal of Epidemiology, 109, pp. 186-204, (1979); Blair A., Zahm S.H., Cancer among farmers, Occupational medicine: State of the art reviews, pp. 335-354, (1991); Brent D.A., Perper J.A., Allman C.J., Moritz G.M., Wartella M.E., Zelanek J.P., Presence and accessibility of firearms in the homes of adolescent suicides, Journal of the American Medical Association, 266, pp. 2989-2993, (1991); Christen W.G., Manson J.E., Seddon J.M., Glynn R.J., Buring J.E., Rosner B., Hennekens C.W., A prospective study of cigarette smoking and risk of cataract in men, Journal of the American Medical Association, 268, 8, pp. 989-993, (1992); Cole T.B., An injury control strategy for rural North Carolina, North Carolina Medical Journal, 54, pp. 508-510, (1993); Coryell W., Endicott J., Keller M., Major depression in a nonclinical sample: Demographic and clinical risk factors for first onset, Archives of General Psychiatry, 49, pp. 117-125, (1992); Cruickshanks K.J., Klein R., Klein B.E., Wiley T.L., Nondahl D.M., Tweed T.S., Cigarette smoking and hearing loss, Journal of the American Medical Association, 279, pp. 1715-1719, (1998); Cummings P., Koepsell T.D., Grossman D.C., Savarino J., Thompson R.S., The association between the purchase of a handgun and homicide or suicide, American Journal of Public Health, 87, pp. 974-978, (1997); Dawber T.R., Framingham study: The epidemiology of atherosclerotic disease, (1980); Dawson D.A., Drinking as a risk factor for sustained smoking, Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 59, 3, pp. 235-249, (2000); Engel L.S., O'Meara E.S., Schwartz S.M., Maternal occupation in agriculture and risk of limb defects in Washington State, 1980-1993, Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health, 26, 3, pp. 193-198, (2000); Gesler W.M., Hartwell S., Ricketts R., Rosenberg M., Introduction, Health in rural North America-The geography of health care services and delivery, pp. 1-22, (1992); Gold M., Franks P., Erickson P., Assessing the health of the nation.

The ability of this device to redirect growth and thus, improve craniofacial asymmetry has raised concerns regarding the potential restriction of cranial growth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth of the head during correction of plagiocephaly. Methods: The study sample consisted of 190 children: 81 females (42.6%) and 109 males (57.4%) All patients had been diagnosed with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly, did not have other significant medical conditions, were compliant with DOC protocol, and had complete anthropometric measurements at entrance and exit from treatment. Growth of the head was evaluated using head circumference, maximum cranial width and maximum cranial length. Correction of plagiocephaly was evaluated by documenting the reduction of craniofacial asymmetry of the cranial vault, skull base and face. Paired t tests were used to assess the significance of changes in these anthropometric measurements. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Results: Average entrance age was 6.5 months with a mean treatment time of 4.1 months. Statistical analysis demonstrated highly significant reductions in asymmetry in all three regions (p < 0.001). More importantly, these corrections were achieved with synchronous growth of the skull as demonstrated by highly significant increases (p < 0.001) in head circumference, maximum cranial width and maximum cranial length. Conclusions: These findings document statistically significant increases in cranial growth in association with concomitant reductions of the cranial asymmetries associated with deformational plagiocephaly.","Anthropometry; Cranial orthosis; Deformational plagiocephaly; Development; Growth","Cephalometry; Facial Asymmetry; Female; Head; Humans; Infant; Infant Care; Male; Orthotic Devices; Posture; Skull; Sleep; Sudden Infant Death; anthropometry; article; bone growth; child; craniofacial morphology; cranioplasty; female; growth rate; human; major clinical study; male; plagiocephaly; priority journal; skull","","","","","","","Positioning and SIDS, Pediatrics, 89, pp. 1120-1126, (1992); Havens D.H., Zink R.L., The 'back to sleep' campaign, J Pediatr Health Care, 8, pp. 240-242, (1994); Argenta L.C., David L.R., Wilson J.A., Bell W.O., An increase in infant cranial deformity with supine sleeping position, J Craniofac Surg, 7, pp. 5-11, (1996); Turk A.E., McCarthy J.G., Cchm T., Wisoff J.H., The 'back to sleep campaign' and deformational plagiocephaly: Is there cause for concern?, J Craniofac Surg, 7, pp. 12-18, (1996); Kane A., Mitchell L., Craven K., Marsh J., Observations on a recent increase in plagiocephaly without synostosis, Pediatrics, 97, pp. 877-885, (1996); Clarren S.K., Smith D.W., Hanson J.W., Helmet treatment for plagiocephaly and congenital muscular torticollis, J Pediatr, 94, pp. 43-46, (1979); Nichter L.S., Persing J.A., Horowitz J.H., Morgan R.F., Nichter M.A., Edgerton M.T., External cranioplasty: Historical perspectives, Plastic Reconstr Surg, 77, pp. 325-332, (1986); Pattisapu J.V., Walker N.L., Myers G.G., Cheever J., Use of helmets for positional molding, Concepts Pediatr Neurosurg, 9, pp. 178-184, (1989); Pollack I.F., Losken H.W., Fasick P., Diagnosis and management of posterior plagiocephaly, Pediatrics, 99, pp. 180-185, (1997); Ripley C.E., Pomatto J.K., Beals S.P., Joganic E.F., Manwaring K.H., Moss S.D., Treatment of positional plagiocephaly with dynamic orthotic cranioplasty, J Craniofac Surg, 5, pp. 150-159, (1994); Littlefield T.R., Beals S.P., Manwaring K.H., Pomatto J.K., Joganic E.F., Golden K.A., Ripley C.E., Treatment of craniofacial asymmetry with dynamic orthotic cranioplasty, J Craniofac Surg, 9, pp. 11-17, (1998); Kelly K.M., Littlefield T.R., Pomatto J.K., Ripley C.E., Beals S.P., Joganic E.F., Importance of early recognition and treatment of deformational plagiocephaly with orthotic cranioplasty, Cleft Palate Craniofac J, 36, pp. 127-130, (1999); Craniosynostosis and Skull Molding Symposium, (1997); International Society of Craniofacial Surgery, VII International Congress, (1997); Farkas L.G., Anthropometry of the Head and Face in Medicine, (1981); Hajnis K., Kopf-, ohrmuschel-und handwachstum (verwendung bei den operationen der angeborenen missbildungen und unfallsfolgen), Acta Univ Carol [Biol] Praha, 2-4, (1972); Kolar J.C., Salter E.M., Craniofacial anthropometry, Practical Measurement of the Head and Face for Clinical, Surgical and Research Use, (1997); SAS/STAT User's Guide, Version 6, 2, (1989); Dekaban A.S., Tables of cranial and orbital measurements, cranial volume, and derived indexes in males and females from 7 days to 20 years of age, Ann Neurol, 2, pp. 485-491, (1977); Hellbusch J.L., Hellbusch L.C., Bruneteau R.J., Active counterpositioning treatment of deformational plagiocephaly, Neb Med J, 80, pp. 344-349, (1995); Moss S.D., Nonsurgical, nonorthotic treatment of occipital plagiocephaly: What is the natural history of the misshapen neonatal head?, J Neurosurg, 87, pp. 667-670, (1997); Mulliken J.B., Vander Woude D.L., Hansen M., LaBrie R.A., Scott R.M., Analysis of posterior plagiocephaly: Deformational versus synostotic, Plastic Reconstr Surg, 103, pp. 371-380, (1999); Consensus Statement Issued at the Craniosynostosis and Skull Molding Symposium, (1997)","T.R.

Hog load-out involves moving hogs from their pens in finishing buildings into a truck for transport to a meat processor. High pressure power washing is conducted for sanitation purposes after a building has been emptied of hogs to remove surface and floor debris. This debri consists of feed, feces, and hog dander as dust or an encrusted form. The hog load-out process necessarily increases pig activity which is known to increase airborne dust concentrations. An unintended consequence of power washing is that the material covering surfaces is forcibly ejected into the atmosphere, creating the potential for a highly concentrated aerosol exposure to workers. The load-out process resulted in a median personal inhalable mass concentration of 7.14 mg m-3 and median endotoxin concentration of 12150 endotoxin units (EU) m-3. When converted to an 8-h time-weighted average for a 'total' sampler, one of the 19 samples exceeded a regulatory limit of 15 mg m-3. An impinger was used to sample power washing endotoxin concentrations, which resulted in a median personal concentration of 40350 EU m-3. These concentrations were among the highest found in the literature for any occupation. With the lack of engineering controls present to reduce airborne contaminant concentrations in swine buildings, either respirator use or a reduction in exposure time is recommended while performing these tasks. © 2012 The Author.","endotoxin; finishing building; impinger; power washing; swine","Air Pollution, Indoor; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Dust; Endotoxins; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Swine; United States; Buildings; Debris; Dust; Truck transportation; endotoxin; Agricultural workers; Airborne contaminants; Airborne dusts; endotoxin; Engineering controls; Exposure-time; Field measurement; High pressure; impinger; Mass concentration; Regulatory limit; swine; Time-weighted averages; Unintended consequences; Work task; Worker exposure; animal; animal husbandry; article; dust; human; indoor air pollution; occupational exposure; swine; United States; Washing","","Dust, ; Endotoxins, ","","","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (P30ES005605)","","Threshold limit values and biological exposure indices, Cincinnati, (2010); Respiratory health hazards in agriculture, Am.

The accuracy of this new system has been independently established. However, before replacing the traditional plaster casting technique, the two methods require a comparison to ensure that the models they produce are equivalent. Methods: Ten sequential infants were digitized by the 3D imaging system and the plaster casting technique following previously reported protocols. The cast models were also digitized so they could be compared with the digitized images. The two models (3dImage and Cast) were then imported into dimensional analysis software and aligned and registered with well-established registration algorithms. Difference maps that identified the variation between the two surfaces were generated for each pair, and descriptive statistics of these differences were recorded. Results: The mean difference between the cast and the digitized models was 0.052 mm (standard deviation = 0.988), with a root mean square (RMS) difference of 1.028 mm. Two-dimensional slices obtained from the registered 3D surfaces demonstrated excellent agreement between the cranial contours. Conclusions: In this investigation, the 3D models created by the new imaging system were found to be within 1.0 mm RMS of the models created by the plaster casting technique. Two-dimensional cranial contours demonstrated excellent agreement between the two methods. The results of this investigation confirmed that the new cranial imaging system and the traditional plaster casting technique yield equivalent models.","Deformational plagiocephaly; Imaging; Plaster casting; Three-dimensional","Algorithms; Analog-Digital Conversion; Cephalometry; Computer Simulation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Head; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Infant; Male; Models, Anatomic; Photography; algorithm; article; computer model; computer program; controlled study; human; infant; intermethod comparison; plaster cast; priority journal; skull radiography; three dimensional imaging","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R43HD035802)","","Arun K.S., Huang T.S., Blostein S.D., Least-squares fitting of two 3-D point sets.

Design: Data were obtained from a random sample of the residents of a rural county, stratified by farm, rural non-farm, and town residence. Hearing test results were obtained from participants between the ages of 8 and 92 years (N = 1972; 47% male). Pure-tone thresholds were classified as normal or impaired using a number of metrics, including speech intelligibility index values. Selected comparisons of crude rates were made with previous population-based studies of hearing loss prevalence. Results: Nearly all (99%) of the participants in this study had significant hearing impairment. Atypical hearing impairment is most prevalent at 6 kHz. In males, this excess impairment shifts to lower frequencies with age but monotonically decreases in females. Notched configurations were most common among those between 30 and 59 years old. In females, the prevalence of hearing impairments sufficient to interfere with speech understanding begins to rapidly increase in the 6th decade (4th decade in males). Comparisons with prior population-based studies in the United States and Great Britain identified few significant differences. Conclusions: Significant hearing impairment is common in rural populations. The high prevalence in this population is similar to that found in other population-based studies. Future studies are needed to examine (1) the risk factors for hearing impairment, (2) the natural course of hearing problems across the life span, and (3) the effect of programs for the prevention of hearing impairment and rehabilitation for persons with existing hearing impairments.

Methods: We analyzed data from the Keokuk County Rural Health Study collected among parents of children age 17 or younger. Parents were interviewed separately regarding the age of their children's involvement in 14 selected agricultural tasks and their opinions about appropriate age of involvement. Findings: Of the 264 families included, 86.5% with a son and 69.8% with a daughter reported having children involved in at least 1 of 14 selected agricultural tasks. The average actual-performance ages for children to be involved in any of the tasks were younger than those that parents perceived appropriate. Furthermore, in 6 of the 9 North American Guidelines for Children's Agricultural Tasks (NAGCAT) that we assessed, parents' perceived-as-appropriate ages were younger than minimum ages recommended by the NAGCAT. Driving an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) was the most common task with actual-performance age younger than the NAGCAT-recommended age; 53.0% of boys (n = 106) and 36.1% of girls (n = 61) did so under the recommended age. Boys and children who live on a farm, or whose parents have been or are farmers, were significantly more likely to perform agricultural tasks at earlier ages. Conclusions: Our results suggest farm parents and other rural stakeholders need to be better educated and encouraged to follow the NAGCAT guidelines, and that multilevel interventions need to be developed to ensure protection of children from agricultural injury and death. © 2012 National Rural Health Association.","Age; Agricultural task; Children; Rural","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Agriculture; Child; Employment; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Iowa; Male; Middle Aged; Parents; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age; agriculture; article; child; employment; female; human; interview; male; manpower; middle aged; parent; psychological aspect; standard; statistics; United States; young adult","","","","","","","Prevention of agricultural injuries among children and adolescents, Pediatrics, 108, pp. 1016-1019, (2001); Hendricks K., Hendricks S., Changing farm injury trends by sex for youth living on US farms, 1998-2006, J Rural Health, 26, pp. 182-188, (2010); Zentner J., Berg R., Pickett W., Marlenga B., Perceptions of risk protect children engaged in farm work, Prev Med, 40, pp. 860-866, (2005); Pryor S., Caruth A., McCoy C., Children's injuries in agriculture related events: the effect of supervision on the injury experience, Issues Compr Pediatr Nurs, 25, pp. 189-205, (2002); Morrongiello B.A., Pickett W., Berg R.L., Linneman J.G., Brison R.J., Marlenga B., Adult supervision and pediatric injuries in the agricultural worksite, Accid Anal Prev, 40, pp. 1149-1156, (2008); Fathallah F.A., Chang J.H., Pickett W., Marlenga B., Ability of youth operators to reach farm tractor controls, Ergonomics, 521, pp. 685-694, (2009); NAGCAT Guidelines, (2011); Lee B.C., Illustrative case study B: applying agricultural work guidelines from one country in another, Child Labour: A Public Health Perspective, pp. 229-241, (2010); Marlenga B., Brison R.J., Berg R.L., Zentner J., Linneman J., Pickett W., Evaluation of the North American Guidelines for Children's Agricultural Tasks using a case series of injuries, Inj Prev., 10, pp. 350-357, (2004); Gadomski A., Ackerman S., Burdick P., Jenkins P., Efficacy of the North American guidelines for children's agricultural tasks in reducing childhood agricultural injuries, Am J Public Health., 96, pp. 722-727, (2006); Marlenga B., Pickett W., Berg R.L., Evaluation of an enhanced approach to the dissemination of the North American Guidelines for Children's Agricultural Tasks: a randomized controlled trial, Prev Med, 35, pp. 150-159, (2002); Brison R.J., Pickett W., Berg R.L., Linneman J., Zentner J., Marlenga B., Fatal agricultural injuries in preschool children: risks, injury patterns and strategies for prevention, CMAJ, 174, pp. 1723-1726, (2006); Merchant J.A., Stromquist A.M., Kelly K.M., Et al., Chronic disease and injury in an agricultural county, J Rural Health., 18, 4, pp. 521-535, (2002); Park H., Reynolds S.J., Kelly K.M., Et al., Characterization of agricultural tasks performed by youth in the Keokuk county rural health study, Appl Occup Environ Hyg., 18, 6, pp. 418-429, (2003); Pickett W., Marlenga B., Berg R., Parental knowledge of child development and the assignment of tractor work to children, Pediatrics., 112, 1, (2003); Hartling L., Brison R., Crumley E., Klassen T., Pickett W., A systematic review of interventions to prevent childhood farm injuries, Am Acad Pediatrics, 114, 4, (2004); Crawley T., Childhood injury: significance and prevention strategies, J Pediatr Nurs, 11, pp. 225-232, (1996); Runyan C.W., Schulman M., Dal Santo J., Bowling J.M., Agans R., Attitudes and beliefs about adolescent work and workplace safety among parents of working adolescents, J Adolesc Health., 44, 4, pp. 349-355, (2009); Extra Rider Means Extra Dangers.

Because previous studies in rural communities often have focused on agricultural workers, much less is known about the occupational exposures in other types of jobs in rural settings. Characterizing airborne occupational exposures that can contribute to respiratory diseases is important so that differences between rural and urban working populations can be assessed. Reporting Period: 1994-2011. Description of System: This investigation used data from the baseline questionnaire completed by adult rural residents participating in the Keokuk County Rural Health Study (KCRHS). The distribution of jobs and occupational exposures to vapor-gas, dust, and fumes (VGDF) among all participants was analyzed and stratified by farming status (current, former, and never) then compared with a cohort of urban workers from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Occupational exposure in the last job was assessed with a job-exposure matrix (JEM) developed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The COPD JEM assesses VGDF exposure at levels of none or low, medium, and high. Results: The 1,699 KCRHS (rural) participants were more likely to have medium or high occupational VGDF exposure (43.2%) at their last job than their urban MESA counterparts (15.0% of 3,667 participants). One fifth (20.8%) of the rural participants currently farmed, 43.1% were former farmers, and approximately one third (36.1%) had never farmed. These three farming groups differed in VGDF exposure at the last job, with the prevalence of medium or high exposure at 80.2% for current farmers, 38.7% for former farmers, and 27.4% for never farmers, and all three percentages were higher than the 15.0% medium or high level of VGDF exposure for urban workers. Interpretation: Rural workers, including those who had never farmed, were more likely to experience occupational VGDF exposure than urban workers. Public Health Action: The occupational exposures of rural adults assessed using the COPD JEM will be used to investigate their potential association with obstructive respiratory health problems (e.g., airflow limitation and chronic bronchitis). This assessment might highlight occupations in need of preventive interventions.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Cohort Studies; Dust; Female; Gases; Humans; Iowa; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Occupations; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Young Adult; air pollutant; dust; gas; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; analysis; cohort analysis; comparative study; dust; female; gas; human; Iowa; male; middle aged; occupation; Occupational Diseases; occupational exposure; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; questionnaire; rural population; statistics and numerical data; urban population; very elderly; young adult","","Air Pollutants, Occupational, ; Dust, ; Gases, ","","","Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health; NIOSH CDC, (07/CCU706145, 50OH07548); Office of Public Health Scientific Services; University of Iowa; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH; West Virginia Department of Transportation, WVDOT","Support (in part) from NIOSH CDC grants #U07/CCU706145 (round 1) and #U50OH07548 (rounds 2 and 3) to the Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health at The University of Iowa; Laura M.

Prevalence of participation in screening and wellness programs was analyzed by employment size and levels of likeliness to participate, and multivariable analyses of employee baseline characteristics regarding participation in screening programs and likelihood of participation in wellness programs was presented as top and bottom quartiles. Results. Those employed in smaller workplaces participated less often in screening programs. Multivariable models identified male gender and those with an abnormal body mass index were associated with nonparticipation, while having a primary care physician was associated with participation. Very few items showed significant statistical difference in willingness to participate. Conclusion. Workforce characteristics and access to health care may influence participation in screening and wellness programs. Employment size is not a determining factor for willingness to participate in wellness programs. © SAGE Publications.","Outcome measure: participation; Research purpose: descriptive; Setting: state, workplace wellness programs; Statewide Survey, Employee Participation, Workplace Wellness, Health Promotion, Prevention Research.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare endotoxin results from different laboratories and environments. We undertook this study to determine if lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extraction efficiency could account for differences among laboratories. We generated and collected aerosols from chicken and swine barns, and corn processing. We randomly allocated side-by-side filter samples to five laboratories for Limulus assay of endotoxin. Lyophilized aliquots of filter extracts were analyzed for 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OHFAs) as a marker of LPS using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There were significant differences in endotoxin assay and GC-MS (LPS) results between laboratories for all dust types (p < 0.01). Patterns of differences between labs varied by dust type. Relationships between assay and GC/MS results also depended on dust type. The percentages of individual 3-OHFA chain lengths varied across labs (p < 0.0001) suggesting that each lab recovered a different fraction of the LPS available. The presence of large amounts of particle associated LPS and absence of a freezing thawing cycle were associated with lower correlations between LPS and bioactivity, consistent with an absence of Limulus response to cell-bound endotoxin. These data suggest that extraction methods affect endotoxin measurements. The LAL methods may be most suitable when comparing exposures within similar environments; GC-MS offers additional information helpful in optimizing sample treatment and extraction. GC-MS may be of use when comparing across heterogeneous environments and should be considered for inclusion in future studies of human health outcomes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005.","","Aerosols; Air Pollution, Indoor; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Chickens; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Laboratories; Limulus Test; Lipopolysaccharides; Reproducibility of Results; Swine; Zea mays; Animalia; Limulus; Sus scrofa; Zea mays; endotoxin; fatty acid derivative; lipopolysaccharide; aerosol; agricultural waste; analytic method; animal housing; article; extraction; freeze thawing; gas chromatography; intermethod comparison; laboratory test; mass spectrometry; organic dust; priority journal","","Aerosols, ; Dust, ; Lipopolysaccharides, ","","","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (P30ES000002)","","Rylander R., Haglind P., Lundholm M., Am.

Method: The sample was a random sample of people living in a single county in Iowa. Participants aged 18 or older (n = 1617) were asked about suicidal ideation in the past year as well as mood, alcohol use, social support, and stressful life events. Results: About 8.2% of the sample reported suicidal ideation. Depressive symptoms, problems resulting from alcohol use, infrequent social contact and financial loss characterized the suicidal group. Conclusion: Depressive symptoms were the strongest correlate of suicidal ideation in this rural sample. In the multivariate analysis, financial loss rather than low income remained a significant correlate of suicidal ideation after controlling for depression. This suggests that change in financial status rather than chronic poverty poses a risk for suicidal ideation.","Financial; Risk factors; Rural communities; Suicide","Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Female; Financial Management; Humans; Iowa; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Rural Population; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Suicide; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; depression; female; human; life event; lowest income group; male; mood; multivariate analysis; normal human; poverty; prevalence; priority journal; rural population; social isolation; social status; social support; socioeconomics; stress; suicidal behavior; United States","","","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (K01MH001964); National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH","","National Vital Statistics Report, (1998); Boxer P., Burnett C., Swanson N., Suicide occupation: A review of the literature, J Occup Environ Med, 37, pp. 442-452, (1995); Gunderson P., Donner D., Nashold R., Salkowicz L., Sperry S., Wittman B., The epidemiology of suicide among farm residents or workers in five north-central states, 1980-1988, Am J Prev Med, 9, pp. 26-32, (1993); Kposowa A., Suicide mortality in the United States: Differentials by industrial and occupational groups, Am J Ind Med, 36, pp. 645-652, (1999); Leavitt P., Stress of farming takes high toll, USA Today, (1991); Malmberg A., Simkin S., Hawton K., Suicide in farmers, Br J Psychiatry, 175, pp. 103-105, (1999); Hatcher S., Debt deliberate self-poisoning, Br J Psychiatry, 164, pp. 111-114, (1994); Morgan H., Burns-Cox C., Pocock H., Pottle S., Deliberate self-harm: Clinical and socio-economic characteristics of 368 patients, Br J Psychiatry, 127, pp. 564-575, (1975); Rancans E., Salander-Renberg E., Jacobsson L., Major demographic, social and economic factors associated to suicide rates in Latvia 1980-98, Acta Psychiatr Scand, 103, pp. 275-281, (2001); Hintikka J., Kontula O., Saarinen P., Tanskanen A., Koskela K., Viinamaki H., Debt suicidal behaivor in the Finnish general population, Acta Psychiatr Scand, 98, pp. 493-496, (1998); Schmitdke A., Bille-Brahe U., Deleo D., Et al., Attempted suicide in Europe: Rates, trends and sociodemographic characteristics of suicide attempters during the period 1989-1992.

In this manuscript, I attempt to clarify the research and reasoning that has led me to suggest that the Austronesian-speaking peoples had a selective advantage in malarious environments. In particular, I hope to dispel any notion that that advantage was due to resistance to malaria and to re-affirm my actual assertion that the genetic basis for the Austronesian advantage was resistance to developing the hyperimmune disease, hyperreactive malarious splenomegaly. I believe that an appreciation of this distinction will ultimately prove to be essential to understanding the role of malaria in facilitating the spread of the Austronesians - in the form of people, languages, and/or genes - throughout the Pacific.","Austronesians; Immunoglobulins; Malaria; Natural selection; Pacific prehistory","","","","","","","","Clark J.T., Kelly K.M., Human genetics, paleoenvironments, and Malaria: Relationships and implications for the settlement of Oceania, American Anthropologist, 95, pp. 613-631, (1993); Crane G.G., The serology of tropical splenomegaly syndrome and its relationship to Malaria, Role of the Spleen in the Immunology of Parasitic Diseases.

Because many patients received more than one implant, a total of 248 implants were used in 80 procedures. The technology of processing demineralized bone implants is described in detail. All patients were operated on by one surgeon (K.E.S.) at the Humana Craniofacial Institute in Dallas, Texas. Forty-one patients had craniofacial deformities, 16 had secondary deformities following cleft lip and palate repair, 8 had bony defects following removal of tumors, and 10 had various skeletal deformities following trauma. Of the 72 patients, 6 had two surgical procedures during which additional implants were inserted. Implants placed in the cranial vault and the maxillary complex, including alveolar grafts, were inlay grafts, whereas implants placed in the orbital, nasal, paranasal, temporal, and malar areas were onlay grafts used for contouring, augmentation, or both. Complications were limited to delayed wound healing in 6 patients. According to our observations, demineralized perforated bone implants represent an encouraging alternative to autogenous bone grafting. Further clinical and experimental studies are necessary to obtain more information about this material. © 1992 Mutaz B.

In another study of the same urban adults, airflow obstruction (AO) was associated with occupational VGDF and the combination of smoking and occupational exposure. The goal of the current study was to determine if similar associations were evident in the sample of rural adults. We analyzed enrollment data from the Keokuk County Rural Health Study (KCRHS), which investigated the health of rural residents in Iowa. We used the same methods as the study of urban adults. A job-exposure matrix (JEM) assigned an occupational VGDF exposure level based on each participants’ last reported job. The health outcome was AO, defined as both the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < lower limit of normal. Of the 1699 KCRHS participants, 436 (25.7%) had high total VGDF occupational exposure, 661 (38.9%) had ever smoked cigarettes, and 110 (6.5%) had AO. The crude frequency of AO increased across the joint categories of smoking (never, ever) and high exposure (no, yes) (p < 0.05 for linear trend). After adjusting for potential confounders, AO was associated with high total occupational VGDF exposure only among smokers (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.002 to 3.26). In conclusion, the association of AO with occupational exposure in the current study of rural adults was similar to what was previously observed among urban adults. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Although mycobacteria have been implicated as causal agents, this has not been established in experimental studies and the mechanisms remain unclear. Other constituents of in-use metalworking fluids (MWFs) may also contribute to the development of lung disease. We investigated the potential for Mycobacterium immunogenum (MI) in MWFs to induce HP. Methods: Mice were exposed intranasally for 3 wk to MI (isolated from MWFs), Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (positive control), saline, endotoxin, MWFs spiked with endotoxin and/or MI, used MWFs, and particulate-fortified used MWFs. Responses were assessed 96 h after the last exposure. Results: Mice exposed to MI in MWFs developed lung pathology consistent with HP along with significantly more monocytes and neutrophils in lung lavage, increased CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio, and marked pulmonary lymphocytosis on histologic examination when compared with saline-treated control mice. Mice with Grade 2 or higher pathology (0-4 point scale) exhibited significantly elevated macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and IL-10 and a trend toward higher RANTES 96 h after the final dose. Endotoxin coexposure augmented lung pathology. Conclusion: MWFs containing mycobacteria induced granulomatous lung lesions, peribronchiolar lymphocytosis, increased cell concentrations in lavage, and up-regulation of several cytokines. These findings are consistent with HP.","Endotoxin; Hypersensitivity pneumonitis; Metalworking fluids; Mycobacteria; Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula","Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Alveolitis, Extrinsic Allergic; Animals; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; CD4-CD8 Ratio; Disease Models, Animal; Endotoxins; Female; Inhalation Exposure; Lung; Metallurgy; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mycobacterium; T-Lymphocytes; endotoxin; interleukin 10; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; RANTES; sodium chloride; allergic pneumonitis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; female; histology; lung lavage; lymphocytosis; mouse; Mycobacterium; mycobacterium immunogenum; nonhuman; priority journal; Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula","","macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, 155075-84-6; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; Aerosols, ; Air Pollutants, ; Endotoxins, ","","","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (P30ES005605)","","Fox J., Anderson H., Moen T., Gruetzmacher G., Hanrahan L., Fink J., Metal working fluid-associated hypersensitivity pneumonitis: An outbreak investigation and case-control study, Am J Ind Med, 35, pp. 58-67, (1999); Kreiss K., Cox-Ganser J., Metalworking fluid-associated hypersensitivity pneumonitis: A workshop summary, Am J Ind Med, 32, pp. 423-432, (1997); Hodgson M.J., Bracker A., Yang C., Storey E., Jarvis B.J., Milton D., Lummus Z., Bernstein D., Cole S., Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in a metalworking environment, Am J Ind Med, 39, pp. 616-628, (2001); Weiss L.P.C., Lewis R., Rossmoore H., Fink J., Harney J., Trout D., Respiratory illness in workers exposed to metal working fluid contaminated with nontuberculous mycobacteria - Ohio, 2001, Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 51, pp. 349-352, (2002); Biopsy-confirmed hypersensitivity pneumonitis in automobile production workers exposed to metalworking fluids: Michigan, 1994-1995, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 45, pp. 606-610, (1996); Thorne P.S., Sprince N.L., Metal working fluids, Textbook of Clinical Occupational and Environmental Health, (2004); Sprince N.L., Thorne P.S., Popendorf W., Zwerling C., Miller E.R., DeKoster J.A., Respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities among machine operators in automobile production, Am J Ind Med, 31, pp. 403-413, (1997); Oxhoj H., Andreasen H., Henius U.M., Respiratory symptoms and ventilatory lung function in machine shop workers exposed to coolant-lubricants, Eur J Respir Dis Suppl, 118, pp. 85-89, (1982); Jarvholm B., Bake B., Lavenius B., Thiringer G., Vokmann R., Respiratory symptoms and lung function in oil mist-exposed workers, J Occup Med, 24, pp. 473-479, (1982); Kennedy S.M., Greaves I.A., Kriebel D., Eisen E.A., Smith T.J., Woskie S.R., Acute pulmonary responses among automobile workers exposed to aerosols of machining fluids, Am J Ind Med, 15, pp. 627-641, (1989); Thorne P.S., DeKoster J.A., Pulmonary effects of machining fluids in guinea pigs and mice, Am Ind Hyg Assoc J, 57, pp. 1168-1172, (1996); Gordon T., Acute respiratory effects of endotoxin-contaminated machining fluid aerosols in guinea pigs, Fundam Appl Toxicol, 19, pp. 117-123, (1992); Schulyer M., Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders. 3rd Ed., pp. 1085-1132, (1998); Rose C., Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Textbook of Respiratory Medicine. 3rd Ed., (2000); Boxer M.B., Grammer L.C., Harris K.E., Roach D.E., Patterson R., Six-year clinical and immunologic follow-up of workers exposed to trimellitic anhydride, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 80, pp. 147-152, (1987); Karol M.H., Thorne P.S., Pulmonary hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity: Implications for assessing allergic responses, Toxicology of the Lung.

This cross-sectional study characterized agricultural work performed by adolescents in a rural Iowa county to better understand the patterns and extent of exposures to agricultural risk factors. This information will help to develop prevention strategies for agriculture-related injury and illnesses for children working on farms. The Keokuk County Rural Health Study is a prospective cohort study of randomly selected households in Iowa. In Round 2, all youth, aged 12 to 17 years participating in this population-based study, were asked about their use of farm machinery, work with livestock, pesticide handling, and other farm activities. The age at which they actually began these activities, the age they believed youth should start these activities, and sources of health and safety training they received were also ascertained. Adults in the study were asked the same questions about youth. Matched parental reports and opinions were compared to their children's reports and opinions using McNemar's chi-square tests. A total of 143 youth and 684 adults with farming experience completed the interviews. There were 118 pairs of parents and youth. Fifty percent of male youth, and 18 percent of females had performed agricultural work at some time in their life. Twenty-five percent of all male youth, and 5 percent of females were currently working on farms. Close to 30 percent had driven tractors, all-terrain vehicles, and pick-up trucks. Despite the legal prohibition of hazardous work by children under age 16, several younger children reported that they had driven a self-propelled combine, worked in silos, or handled and applied fertilizers in the past 12 months. Youth began riding on tractors at a mean age of 7. The mean ages for driving tractors and all-terrain vehicles were 11 and 10, respectively. The mean age for driving a self-propelled combine was 13. Children began applying or handling fertilizers at the age of 12. There were discrepancies between parent and youth reports regarding the frequencies, starting age, and opinions relative to performing agricultural tasks. These results suggest the need for implementing guidelines, particularly for age appropriate agricultural tasks.","Age; Agriculture; Children; Task; Youth","Adolescent; Age Factors; Agriculture; Attitude; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Welfare; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Iowa; Male; Occupational Exposure; Risk Factors; Task Performance and Analysis; agricultural chemical; fertilizer; pesticide; adolescent; agricultural procedures; agricultural worker; article; female; human; livestock; male; motor vehicle; occupational accident; occupational safety; parent; priority journal; public health; rural area; school child; United States","","","","","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, (U07/CCU706145)","This work was funded by a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (U07/CCU706145).

However, no detailed study has yet explored its potential role in renal ischemia, which is inevitable in transplantation and surgical and nonsurgical conditions associated with hypotension and shock. This functional and microanatomical study was carried out on dogs subjected to renal warm ischemia with contralateral nephrectomy. Group I (control; N = 4) had bilateral renal dissection and right nephrectomy. Groups II-IV had their kidney pedicles cross-clamped for 60 min and then reperfused. Group II (N = 9) ischemic kidneys received no treatment. Group III (N = 6) kidneys were flushed with pure Nx HCl (2 mg/kg) during ischemia. Group IV (N = 6) dogs received one iv Nx bolus (2 mg/kg) before clamping and another dose before declamping. Biopsies for adenine nucleotides, histology, and ultrastructure were obtained before ischemia, before reflow, and 15 min and 7 days after reflow. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were measured daily. Ischemia induced significant renal dysfunction, which was reversed by systemic Nx. Nx offered a remarkable protection against postischemic structural damage. Seventy percent of Group II cortical sections showed grade 4 acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and severe residual damage after a week. Eighty-three percent of Group IV sections showed grade 1 ATN and no residual damage after a week. One week survival was 33% in Group II and 100% in Group IV. Nx can be useful in prevention of acute renal failure in clinical situations with arterial hypotension and shock. © 1987.","","Adenine Nucleotides; Animals; Blood Urea Nitrogen; Creatinine; Dogs; Kidney; Kidney Cortex; Kidney Failure, Acute; Naloxone; Nephrectomy; Postoperative Complications; Regional Blood Flow; Temperature; naloxone; animal experiment; animal model; dog; drug efficacy; intravenous drug administration; kidney; kidney blood flow; kidney ischemia; nonhuman; prevention; priority journal; regional perfusion","","naloxone, 357-08-4, 465-65-6; Adenine Nucleotides, ; Creatinine, 60-27-5; Naloxone, 465-65-6","","","Department of Surgery; University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics","’ Supported by the Department of Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. ’ To whom correspondence should be addressed at the Department of Surgery, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52242.","Albert, Shires, Illner, Et al., Effects of naloxone in hemorrhagic shock, Surg.

Airborne particulate levels were assessed during summer, winter, and spring. Personal aerosol measurements of workers were made with a photometer every 15 sec and corrected to compare with an integrated concentration measurement made with a co-located IOM inhalable dust sampler. Task type and time period were recorded by the workers over an 8-hr work shift. There was a significant difference in dust concentrations between seasons (p 0.001), with winter months providing the highest levels (geometric mean = 3.76 mg/m3). The application of a general linear model of log-transformed task concentrations relative to site, season, and task demonstrated significant differences (P 0.001) among all three covariates. Tasks performed near moving animals, especially the weaning process, resulted in the greatest concentrations. These results indicate the need to evaluate the concentration levels for separate tasks during multi-task work shifts, such as swine rearing, to optimize efforts to minimize exposures by focusing on high-concentration tasks.","Aerosol photometers; Agricultural production; Taskbased analysis","Agriculture; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Dust; Endotoxins; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Particle Size; Photometry; Swine; Task Performance and Analysis; aerosol; article; clinical assessment; comparative study; controlled study; dust exposure; female; geometry; male; measurement; nonhuman; particulate matter; photometer; priority journal; rearing; sampler; sow (swine); spring; statistical model; summer; task performance; time; weaning; winter; work; worker","","Air Pollutants, Occupational, ; Dust, ; Endotoxins, ","","","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, (U50 OH007548-06)","T his study was supported by NIOSH through funds sup-plied to the Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health (U50 OH007548-06).","Swine 2000, Part IV: Changes in the U.S. Pork Industry, 1990-2000; Vonessen S., Donham K., Illness and injury in animal confinement workers, Occup.

Dynamic Orthotic Cranioplasty (DOC) was developed as a nonsurgical alternative for the treatment of positional plagiocephaly. The effectiveness of DOC has been discussed elsewhere. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of factors such as entrance age, treatment time, and initial severity on the effectiveness of correction. Methods: The study sample consisted of 258 children with cranial vault asymmetry (CVA) treated prior to 1 year of age. In addition, 246 patients (92%) exhibited concurrent skull base (SBA) and orbitotragial depth (OTDA) asymmetries. All patients had been diagnosed with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly, did not have other contributing medical conditions, were compliant with DOC protocol, and had complete anthropometric measurements at entrance and exit from treatment. Results: Mean age at start of treatment was 6.5 (±1.9) months (range, 2.8 to 11.0 months), with an average treatment time of 4.1 (±2.2) months. The effects of the treatment variables were analyzed using three-way analysis of variance. As expected, initial severity was significantly associated with the amount of correction (p = .0001). However, treatment time was not significant (p > .05). Most importantly, the analysis revealed that, having accounted for initial severity, entrance age had a statistically significant effect [F((1,254) = 8.36, p = .0042] on the correction of CVA. Similar results were identified for both the SBA [F(1,254) = 5.53, p = .0195] and the OTDA [F(1,254) = 5.22, p = .0231] asymmetries. Conclusions: These findings support clinical observations that earlier intervention results in significantly improved treatment of plagiocephaly, independent of the severity of the presenting asymmetries.","Anthropometrics; Clinical outcomes; Dynamic Orthotic Cranioplasty (DOC); Positional plagiocephaly","Analysis of Variance; Cephalometry; Cranial Sutures; Craniosynostoses; Facial Asymmetry; Humans; Infant; Infant Care; Occipital Bone; Orthotic Devices; Skull; Skull Base; Sleep; Supine Position; age; article; disease severity; early diagnosis; face asymmetry; female; human; infant; major clinical study; male; orthotics; patient compliance; plagiocephaly; priority journal; risk factor; treatment outcome","","","","","","","Baum J.D., Searls D., Head shape and size of pre-term low-birth-weight infants, Dev Med Child Neurol, 13, pp. 576-581, (1971); Bruneteau R.J., Mulliken J.B., Frontal plagiocephaly: Synostotic, compensational, or deformational, Plast Reconstr Surg, 89, pp. 21-31, (1992); Clarren S.K., Plagiocephaly and torticollis: Etiology, natural history, and helmet treatment, J Pediatr, 98, pp. 92-95, (1981); Clarren S.K., Smith D.W., Congenital deformities, Pediatr Clin North Am, 24, pp. 665-677, (1977); Clarren S.K., Smith D.W., Hanson J.W., Helmet treatment for plagiocephaly and congenital muscular torticollis, J Pediatr, 94, pp. 43-46, (1979); Danby P.M., Plagiocephaly in some 10-year-old children, Arch Dis Child, 37, pp. 500-504, (1962); Dunn P.M., The Influence of the Intrauterine Environment in the Causation of Congenital Postural Deformities with Special Reference to Congenital Dislocation of the Hip, (1969); Dunn P.M., Congenital postural deformities, Br Med Bull, 32, pp. 71-76, (1976); Farkas L.G., Anthropometry of the Head and Face in Medicine, (1981); Hajnis K., Kopf-ohrmuschel- und handwachstum (verwendung bei den opeerationen der angerborenen missbildungen und unfallsfolgen), Acta Univ Carol (Biol) Praha, 1974, pp. 2-4, (1972); Haung C.S., Cheng H.C., Lin W.Y., Liou J.W., Chen Y.R., Skull morphology affected by different sleep positions in infancy, Cleft Palate Craniofac J, 32, pp. 413-419, (1995); Huang M.H., Gruss J.S., Clarren S.K., Mouradian W.E., Cunningham M.L., Roberts T.S., Loeser J.D., Cornell C.J., The differential diagnosis of posterior plagiocephaly: True lambdoid synostosis versus positional molding, Plast Reconstr Surg, 98, pp. 765-774, (1996); Jones P.G., Torticollis in Infancy and Childhood, (1969); Kawamoto H.K., Torticollis versus plagiocephaly, Craniofacial Surgery: International Society for Craniomaxillofacial Surgery, pp. 105-109, (1987); Kolar J.C., Salter E.M., Craniofacial Anthropometry.

In part 1 of this investigation, we demonstrated that children of multiple birth pregnancies are at higher risk for development of deformational plagiocephaly. In the current investigation, we explore whether certain prenatal and postnatal risk factors predispose one twin over the other by examining the occurrence and severity of plagiocephaly in both discordant (only 1 affected) and concordant (both affected) twin pairs. Methods. Throughout 1999, we obtained detailed medical histories on 140 sets of twins who had presented for treatment at 1 of 9 treatment centers across the United States. The study cohort consisted of 46 concordant and 94 discordant twin pairs (a total of 280 study participants). Information about prenatal and postnatal history of each infant was obtained through detailed review of the children's medical records as well as analysis of a patient database maintained on all infants who receive treatment. Follow-up interviews were performed to verify the information recorded and to obtain additional information about the child who had not received treatment (if appropriate) or use of reproductive assistance (fertility drugs, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, etc) that had not been previously recorded. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the effects of prenatal and postnatal risk factors (in utero position, in utero orientation, birth weight, neck involvement, sleeping position) with respect to which infant was affected in the discordant twin pairs and to which infant was more severely affected in the concordant twin pairs. Results. Statistical analyses of both discordant and concordant twin pairs demonstrated that the lower in utero infant was significantly more likely to be affected (χ2 = 17.391). In addition, the more severely affected infant was significantly more likely to have some form of neck involvement (torticollis, neck tightness; χ2 = 46.380), as well as have been carried in a vertex position (χ2 = 7.408). Conversely, neither sleeping position nor gender was found to be associated with development of plagiocephaly. Conclusions. The results of this investigation strongly support an in utero cause of plagiocephaly and demonstrate that intrauterine positioning may play a prominent role in determining both the occurrence and severity of deformational plagiocephaly in twins. These findings confirm that the lower in utero infant is at increased risk for the development of plagiocephaly, likely resulting from the more restrictive intrauterine environment encountered during the later part of the pregnancy.","Deformational plagiocephaly; Multiple birth; Plurality","Abnormalities, Multiple; Adult; Comorbidity; Cranial Sutures; Diseases in Twins; Facial Asymmetry; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature, Diseases; Labor Presentation; Male; Pregnancy; Risk Assessment; Sex Distribution; Torticollis; fertility promoting agent; article; birth weight; body position; cohort analysis; controlled study; data base; disease predisposition; disease severity; face deformity; female; follow up; high risk population; human; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; major clinical study; male; multiple pregnancy; newborn; plagiocephaly; priority journal; reproductive procedures; risk assessment; sleep; statistical analysis; torticollis; twin pregnancy","","","","","","","Argenta L., David L., Wilson J., Bell W., An increase in infant cranial deformity with supine sleeping position, J Craniofac Surg, 7, pp. 5-11, (1996); Kane A., Mitchell L., Craven K., Marsh J., Observations on a recent increase in plagiocephaly without synostosis, Pediatrics, 97, pp. 877-885, (1996); Turk A., McCarthy J., Thorne C., Wisoff J., The ""Back to Sleep Campaign"" and deformational plagiocephaly: Is there a cause for concern?, J Craniofac Surg, 7, pp. 12-18, (1996); Littlefield T.R., Beals S.P., Manwaring K.H., Et al., Treatment of craniofacial asymmetry with dynamic orthotic cranioplasty, J Craniofac Surg, 1, pp. 11-17, (1998); Huang M., Gruss J.S., Clarren S.K., Et al., The differential diagnosis of posterior plagiocephaly: True lambdoid synostosis versus positional molding, Plast Reconstr Surg, 98, pp. 765-774, (1996); Dunn P.M., The Influence of Intrauterine Environment in the Causation of Congenital Postural Deformities With Special Reference to Congenital Dislocation of the Hip, (1969); Braun F.T., Jones K.L., Smith D.W., Breech presentation as an indication of fetal abnormality, J Pediatr, 86, pp. 419-421, (1975); Clarren S.K., Smith D.W., Congenital deformities, Pedriatr Clin North Am, 24, pp. 665-677, (1977); Haberkern C.M., Smith D.W., Joens K.L., The ""breech head"" and its relevance, Am J Dis Child, 133, pp. 154-156, (1979); Bruneteau R., Mulliken J., Frontal plagiocephaly: Synostotic, compensation, or deformational, Plast Reconstr Surg, 89, pp. 21-31, (1992); Positioning and SIDS, Pediatrics, 89, pp. 1120-1126, (1992); Changing concepts of sudden infant death syndrome: Implications for infant sleeping environment and sleep position, Pediatrics, 105, pp. 650-656, (2000); Littlefield T.R., Kelly K.M., Pomatto J.K., Beals S.P., Multiple birth infants at higher risk for development of deformational plagiocephaly, Pediatrics, 3, pp. 565-569, (1999); Kelly K.M., Littlefield T.R., Pomatto J.K., Et al., Cranial growth unrestricted during treatment of deformational plagiocephaly with dynamic orthotic cranioplasty, Pediatr Neurosurg, 30, pp. 193-199, (1999); Mulliken J.B., Vander Woude D.L., Hansen M., Et al., Analysis of posterior plagiocephaly: Deformational versus synostotic, Plast Reconstr Surg, 103, pp. 371-380, (1999); Browne D., Congenital deformities of mechanical origin, Proc R Soc Med, 29, pp. 1409-1431, (1936); Chapple C.C., Davidson D.T., A study of the relationship between fetal position and certain congenital deformities, J Pediatr, 18, pp. 483-493, (1941); Jones P.G., Torticollis in Infancy and Childhood, (1969); Clarren S.K., Smith D.W., Hanson J., Helmet treatment for plagiocephaly and congenital muscular torticollis, J Pediatr, 94, pp. 43-46, (1979); Kawamoto H.K., Torticollis versus plagiocephaly, Craniofacial Surgery: International Society for CranioMaxilloFacial Surgery, pp. 105-109, (1987); Cooperman D.R., The differential diagnosis of torticollis in children, Torticollis: Differential Diagnosis, Assessment and Treatment, Surgical Management and Bracing, pp. 1-12, (1977); Dunn P.M., Congenital sternomastoid torticollis: An intrauterine postural deformity, Arch Dis Child, 49, pp. 824-825, (1974)","T.R.

A prior analysis of enrollment data identified an association of airflow obstruction with occupational exposures only among cigarette smokers. The current study used spirometry data from all three rounds to investigate whether level of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and longitudinal change in FEV1 were associated with occupational vapor–gas, dust, and fumes (VGDF) exposures, and whether these associations were modified by smoking. Methods: This study sample comprised 1071 adult KCRHS participants with longitudinal data. A job-exposure matrix (JEM) was applied to participants’ lifetime work histories to assign exposures to occupational VGDF. Mixed regression models of pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (millimeters, ml) were fit to test for associations with occupational exposures while adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Mineral dust had the most consistent association with change in FEV1, including ever/never (– 6.3 ml/year) and nearly every level of duration, intensity, and cumulative exposure. Because 92% of participants with mineral dust also had organic dust exposure, the results for mineral dust may be due to a combination of the two. An association of FEV1 level with fumes was observed for high intensity (– 91.4 ml) among all participants, and limited to cigarette smokers with results of – 104.6 ml ever/never exposed, – 170.3 ml high duration, and – 172.4 ml high cumulative. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that mineral dust, possibly in combination with organic dust, and fumes exposure, especially among cigarette smokers, were risk factors for adverse FEV1 results. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Job-exposure matrix; Lifetime work history; Longitudinal study; Obstructive pulmonary disease; Rural adults","Adult; Dust; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Iowa; Longitudinal Studies; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Rural Population; adult; chronic obstructive lung disease; dust; epidemiology; forced expiratory volume; human; Iowa; longitudinal study; occupational disease; occupational exposure; rural population","","Dust, ","","","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, (07/CCU706145, 50OH07548); National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH; University of Iowa, UI","The KCRHS was supported (in part) by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under Grants #U07/CCU706145 (Round 1) and #U50OH07548 (Round 2 and 3) to the Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health at The University of Iowa.

Establishing dose-response relationships is problematic because there are no standard procedures for sampling and analysis. The goal of this study was to compare endotoxin analyses in six laboratories using Limulus-based assays for analysis of organic dusts from three agricultural environments: chicken barns, swine barns, and corn processing facilities. For each dust generation experiment 14 side-by-side air samples were collected on 37-mm glass fiber filters at flows of 1.8 L/min. Each laboratory was randomly allocated two filters from each of seven experiments per dust type. Three laboratories used the QCL-1000 endpoint assay, and three used the kinetic-QCL method. To eliminate variability among different lots, a single lot of Limulus amebocyte lysate for endpoint assays and one similar lot for kinetic assays was provided. Precision of assays performed within labs was very good, with pooled coefficients of variation for replicate samples ranging from 1 to 11% over all labs and all dust types. There were significant differences between laboratories for all three dust types (p,0.01). The pattern of differences between labs varied by dust type. For chicken dust, labs using the endpoint method reported higher results than those using kinetic methods. For swine and corn dusts, labs using the kinetic method reported the highest endotoxin values. For chicken dust, results from all labs except A and B were highly correlated (r50.86–1.00). For swine dust, only labs B and E, and C and D were correlated. For corn, A, B, and D were significantly correlated with most other labs. In conclusion, statistical differences in performance between laboratories were apparent and may be related to the extraction and analytical methods. The results of this study will be useful for standardization of sampling and analysis of airborne endotoxin in agriculture. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Methods: The study population consisted of all children aged 6 to 14 years enrolled in 10 school districts in 2 noncontiguous rural Iowa counties from 2000 through 2002. The mailed parental screening questionnaire included the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood core questionnaire, items from the Functional Severity Index, and items on physician diagnosis and medication and urgent care use. Results: The response rate was 86.6%. The 12-month prevalence of wheeze was 19.1%. Self-reported physician diagnosis of asthma was reported by 13.4%. On multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, and county, children who lived on farms were less likely than those who lived in town to have ever wheezed (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87) or to have wheezed during the past year (odds ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98). However, this protective association with farming was only observed in one of the study counties. Among those who wheezed, farm and nonfarm children were equally likely to have been given a diagnosis of asthma and had comparable morbidity. Conclusion: By using a standardized questionnaire with a high response rate in this large, rural, population-based study, asthma prevalence rivaled that in large Midwestern cities. Unmeasured risk factors might account for the apparent protective effect in Keokuk County. These findings cast doubt on a protective effect of rural life for the development of childhood asthma.","Asthma; Children; Farm; Rural; Screening","adolescent; article; asthma; child; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; female; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; multivariate analysis; physician; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; response time; risk factor; rural area; screening test; self report; wheezing","","","","","University of Iowa, Environmental Health Sciences Research Center, (P30-ES05605); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (P01ES009607); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, (R826711)","Supported by a grant jointly funded by the NIEHS (ES09607) and the EPA (R826711).

Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men in Iowa, surpassed only by non-melanotic skin cancer. Epidemiology studies have evaluated arsenic exposure from drinking water and prostate cancer, but most have focused on high-level exposures outside the US. As drinking water from groundwater sources is a major source of arsenic exposure, we conducted an ecologic study to evaluate prostate cancer and arsenic in drinking water from public water sources and private wells in Iowa, where exposure levels are low, but duration of exposure can be long. Arsenic data from public water systems were obtained from the Iowa Safe Drinking Water Information System for the years 1994–2003 and for private wells from two Iowa Well Water Studies, the Iowa Community Private Well Study (ICPWS, 2002–2003) and Iowa Statewide Rural Well Water Survey Phase 2 (SWIRL2, 2006–2008) that provided data for 87 Iowa counties. Prostate cancer incidence data from 2009 to 2013 for Iowa were obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results’ SEER*Stat software. County averages of water arsenic levels varied from 1.08 to 18.6 ppb, with three counties above the current 10 ppb limit. Based on the tertiles of arsenic levels, counties were divided into three groups: low (1.08–2.06 ppb), medium (2.07–2.98 ppb), and high (2.99–18.6 ppb). Spatial Poisson regression modeling was conducted to estimate the risk ratios (RR) of prostate cancer by tertiles of arsenic level at a county level, adjusted for demographic and risk factors. The RR of prostate cancer were 1.23 (95% CI, 1.16–1.30) and 1.28 (95% CI, 1.21–1.35) in the medium and high groups, respectively, compared to the low group after adjusting for risk factors. The RR increased to 1.36 (95% CI, 1.28–1.45) in the high group when analyses were restricted to aggressive prostate cancers (Gleason score ≥ 7). This study shows a significant dose-dependent association between low-level arsenic exposure and prostate cancer, and if this result is replicated in future individual-level studies, may suggest that 10 ppb is not protective for human health. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Arsenic; Drinking water; Iowa; Private well water; Prostate cancer","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arsenic; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Incidence; Iowa; Male; Middle Aged; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; arsenic; drinking water; water pollutant; adult; aged; analysis; chemically induced; environmental exposure; human; incidence; Iowa; male; middle aged; Prostatic Neoplasms; risk factor; very elderly; water pollutant","","arsenic, 7440-38-2; Arsenic, ; Drinking Water, ; Water Pollutants, Chemical, ","","","National Cancer Institute, NCI; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (P42ES013661); Department of Natural Resources; National Center for Environmental Health; University of Iowa, (HHSN261201300020I, N01-PC-35143); Iowa Department of Public Health; Gulf Research Program, (P42 ES013661); Iowa Department of Natural Resources; College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of Northern Iowa; Core","Funding text 1:  Financial support for T.R. was provided by the Training Core of the Iowa Superfund Research Program P42 ES013661 from NIEHS and the Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contaminants (CHEEC).

The study focuses on injury and respiratory disease and monitors health care delivery, geriatric health, mental health, and other health outcomes, as well as behavioral risk factors for disease and injury. Injury and disease prevalence is investigated in relation to occupational, agricultural, and other environmental exposures. The KCRHS enrolled 1004 families in Round 1 (1994 to 1998) and 1002 families in Round 2 (1999 to 2004). Participants range in age from newborn to 98 years of age and are about equally divided between males and females. The families live in farm, rural nonfarm, and town households, representing men, women, and children, the elderly, farmers, and nonfarmers. The KCRHS is currently in Round 3 (2006-2011). Although the sample is stratified by residence type, the entire county is, by definition, rural, because the largest town has fewer than 2500 residents. Using the Keokuk County Rural Health Study as an example, this paper describes the methodological challenges faced in conducting a large rural prospective population-based cohort study. Some of these challenges are inherent in any large cohort study; others are unique to rural cohort studies. Topics considered include planning the study, developing the protocol, sampling, recruiting and tracking subjects, data collection and management, sustaining funding, relating to the community, and sharing data.","Agricultural health; Occupational health; Rural cohort study; Rural environmental health; Rural health and safety; Rural longitudinal study; Rural population-based study; Rural prospective study","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Agricultural Workers' Diseases; Agriculture; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Data Collection; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiologic Research Design; Health Status; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Iowa; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Rural Health; Rural Population; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; agriculture; article; child; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; epidemiology; health; health status; human; infant; information processing; male; methodology; middle aged; newborn; occupational disease; preschool child; prospective study; rural population; United States","","","","","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH; University of Iowa, UI","This study is made possible through grants from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to the Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health, Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, College of Public Health, The University of Iowa.

This study was conducted to address that research gap by calculating the noise exposures for tasks and equipment associated with grain production and assessing the variability in those exposures. An additional aim of this study was to identify tasks and equipment that could be targeted for intervention strategies as a means toward reducing the total noise exposures of farmers and farm workers. Through the use of personal noise dosimetry and direct observation, over 30,000 one-minute noise exposure measurements and corresponding task and equipment data were collected on 18 farms and compiled into a task-based noise exposure database. Mean noise exposures were calculated for 23 tasks and 18 pieces of equipment. The noise exposures for the tasks and equipment ranged from 78.6 to 99.9 dBA and from 80.8 to 96.2 dBA, respectively, with most of the noise exposures having a large standard deviation and maximum noise exposure level. Most of the variability in the task and equipment noise exposures was attributable to within-farm variations (e.g., work practices, distance from noise sources). Comparisons of the mean noise exposures for the agricultural tasks and equipment revealed that most were not statistically different. Grain production tasks and equipment with high mean noise exposures were identified. However, the substantial variability in the noise exposures and the occurrence of intense noise measurements for nearly every task and piece of equipment indicate that targeting a few specific tasks or equipment for intervention strategies would reduce lifetime noise exposure but would not completely eliminate exposure to hazardous noise levels. © 2013 ASABE ISSN 1074-7583.","Noise; Noise exposure; Safety and health","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Agriculture; Cereals; Ear Protective Devices; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Noise, Occupational; Occupational Exposure; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; agriculture; article; cereal; ear protective device; environmental monitoring; female; human; industrial noise; male; middle aged; occupational exposure; statistics; utilization review","","","","","","","Benke G., Sim M., Fritschi L., Aldred G., Beyond the job exposure matrix (JEM): The task exposure matrix (TEM), Ann.

We used data from the AGRICOH consortium, a collective of prospective cohorts of agricultural workers, to assess respiratory disease prevalence among adults in 18 cohorts representing over 200,000 farmers, farm workers, and their spouses from six continents. Methods: Cohorts collected data between 1992 and 2016 and ranged in size from 200 to >128,000 individuals; 44% of participants were female. Farming practices varied from subsistence farming to large-scale industrial agriculture. All cohorts provided respiratory outcome information for their cohort based on their study definitions. The majority of outcomes were based on self-report using standard respiratory questionnaires; the greatest variability in assessment methods was associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results: For all three respiratory symptoms (cough, phlegm, and wheeze), the median prevalence in men was higher than in women, with the greatest difference for phlegm (17% vs. 10%). For asthma, women had a higher prevalence (7.8% vs 6.5%), with the difference associated with allergic asthma. The relative proportion of allergic asthma varied among cohorts. In two of eight cohorts for women and two of seven cohorts for men, allergic asthma was more common than non-allergic asthma. Conclusions: These findings indicate that respiratory outcomes are common among farmers around the world despite differences in agricultural production. As women in the general population are at higher risk of asthma, exploring gender differences in occupational studies is critical for a deeper understanding of respiratory disease among agricultural workers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Farmers; Farmworkers; Gender; Occupational Exposure; Respiratory Health","Adult; Agricultural Workers' Diseases; Agriculture; Female; Humans; Male; Occupational Exposure; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; adult; agriculture; female; human; male; occupational disease; occupational exposure; prevalence; prospective study; risk factor; sex factor","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (ZIAES049030); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH; North Carolina State University, NCSU, (U07/CCU706145, U50 OH07548); North Carolina State University, NCSU; University of Iowa, UI; South African Medical Research Council, SAMRC, (04/15); South African Medical Research Council, SAMRC; South Africa Netherlands research Programme on Alternatives in Development, SANPAD; Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT, (15130011); Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT","This work was supported by Dr. Hoppin’s startup funds at NC State University.

Deformational plagiocephaly refers to the development of an abnormal head shape in infants resulting from externally applied molding forces, which may occur either prenatally or postnatally. We have observed that an unexpectedly high number of multiple-birth infants have presented to our center with this condition. The purposes of this investigation were to: 1) determine the significance of this observation; and 2) examine the risk factors that may make this population more susceptible to the development of plagiocephaly. Materials and Methods. A retrospective review of our database was performed to identify those infants who were of multiple-birth origin. The parents of these infants were contacted by phone to complete a survey regarding the prenatal and postnatal history of their child. Similar information was obtained for the state of Arizona from the Office of Vital Statistics. A χ2 analysis was used to compare the incidence of multiple births in Arizona with the incidence of multiple births in our treatment population. Results. Between 1993 and 1996, 69 (8.6%) of the 801 infants treated for deformational plagiocephaly at our Phoenix center were of multiple-birth origin. Four infants who had been treated postoperatively after surgery for craniosynostosis, as well as 5 patients who had been referred from out of state, were excluded from further study. The χ2 analysis of the remaining 60 patients confirmed that a statistically significant number of plural-birth infants had presented with deformational plagiocephaly. Four risk factors were identified as having occurred at high frequency in this population: in utero constraint, supine sleeping position, torticollis, and prematurity. Conclusions. The current findings of this investigation confirm that a significant number of multiple-birth infants have presented to our clinic with deformational plagiocephaly. Compared with their singleton counterparts, plural infants seem to be at higher risk for the development of deformational plagiocephaly, because they are more likely to be exposed to multiple risk factors.","Deformational plagiocephaly;

The purpose of this study was to compare infant head shapes against head shapes of their biologic parents to explore the roles of heredity and environment on cranial shape. Standardized family photographs and anthropometric measurements demonstrated that 30% of the infants had cranial widths 2 standard deviations above norm, while 4.6% had widths exceeding 3 standard deviations. Despite a mean age of only 8 months, 11.6% had widths that were already greater than that of 1 parent. These results demonstrate that plagiocephaly has taken on a new configuration, presenting not only with asymmetry, but also with excessive cranial width. © 2006 Westminster Publications, Inc.","","Adult;

Sixty-seven purebred beagles were used in this experiment. The animals were divided into four groups: two control groups (unoperated and unrepaired) and two experimental groups (lip repair without undermining and lip repair with undermining). Lip pressures were monitored in all groups. Significantly higher lip pressures were observed in animals with soft-tissue undermining. Cephalometric measurements were analyzed using univariate and multivariate techniques. The results of this study indicate that lip repair performed with soft-tissue undermining results in more severe craniofacial growth aberrations than lip repair performed alone. © 1988 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.","","Analysis of Variance; Animal; Cephalometry; Cleft Lip; Cleft Palate; Comparative Study; Disease Models, Animal; Dogs; Evaluation Studies; Female; Human; Infant, Newborn; Lip; Male; Maxillofacial Development; Pressure; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Surgery, Plastic; Time Factors; animal experiment; animal model; cephalometry; cleft lip; diagnosis; dog; etiology; face growth; lip reconstruction; methodology; nonhuman; priority journal; soft tissue; surgery","","","","","","","Veau V., Bec-de-lièvre, (1938); Auxhausen G., Technik Und Ergebnisse Der Spaltplasti-Ken, (1952); Burian F., Chirurgie Rozstepu Rtu a Patra, (1954); Burian F., The Plastic Surgery Atlas, 2, (1968); Skoog T., Plastic Surgery, (1974); Skoog T., Skoog’s Method of Repair of Unilateral and Bilateral Cleft Lip, Cleft Lip and Palate, (1971); Millard D.R., Cleft Craft: The Evolution of its Surgery, The Unilateral Deformity, 1, (1976); Walker J.C., Collito M.B., Mancusi-Ungaro A., Meijer R., Physiologic considerations in cleft lip closure: The C-W technique, Plast.

The occurrence of arsenic and atrazine in drinking water from Iowa’s private wells and public water systems was investigated over several decades. In this study, the percentages of detection and violation of regulations were compared over region, season, and water source, and factors affecting the detection and concentration of arsenic and atrazine were analyzed using a mixed-effects model. Atrazine contamination in drinking water was found to vary by region, depending on agricultural usage patterns and hydrogeological features. The annual median atrazine levels of all public water systems were below the drinking water standard of 3 ppb in 2001–2014. Around 40% of public water systems contained arsenic at levels > 1 ppb in 2014, with 13.8% containing arsenic at levels of 5–10 ppb and 2.6% exceeding 10 ppb. This unexpected result highlights the ongoing public health threat posed by arsenic in drinking water in Iowa, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and mitigation efforts to reduce exposure and associated health risks. Additionally, an atrazine metabolite, desethylatrazine, should be monitored to obtain a complete account of atrazine exposure and possible health effects. © 2023 by the authors.","arsenic; atrazine; drinking water; Iowa; water quality","Arsenic; Atrazine; Drinking Water; Iowa; Public Health; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply; Iowa; United States; arsenic; atrazine; deethylatrazine; drinking water; surface water; well water; arsenic; atrazine; drinking water; arsenic; atrazine; concentration (composition); drinking water; health risk; pollution exposure; public health; Article; contamination; environmental exposure; health hazard; human; Iowa; limit of detection; microbial community; nonhuman; particulate matter; prevalence; public health; seasonal variation; water quality; water supply; epidemiology; water pollutant","","arsenic, 7440-38-2; atrazine, 1912-24-9; deethylatrazine, 6190-65-4; Arsenic, ; Atrazine, ; Drinking Water, ; Water Pollutants, Chemical, ","","","University of Iowa Environmental Health Science Research Center NIEHS, (P30ES05605); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (P42ES013661)","This study acknowledges the support of the Training Core of the Iowa Superfund Research Program NIEHS P42ES013661 and the University of Iowa Environmental Health Science Research Center NIEHS P30ES05605.","Akhtar N., Syakir Ishak M.I., Bhawani S.A., Umar K., Various natural and anthropogenic factors responsible for water quality degradation: A review, Water, 13, (2021); Burkholder J., Libra B., Weyer P., Heathcote S., Kolpin D., Thorne P.S., Wichman M., Impacts of waste from concentrated animal feeding operations on water quality, Environ.

Methods: A statewide survey of 1602 Iowans included items from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention QoL and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey prevention behavior questionnaires used to assess employee well-being; their indicator Results are related to World Health Organizations Health and Work Performance Questionnaire-derived absenteeism and presenteeism scores. Results: The unemployed exhibited poorer QoL and prevention behaviors; the self-employed exhibited many better QoL scores due largely to better prevention behaviors than those employed by organizations. Higher QoL measures and more prevention behaviors are associated with lower absenteeism and lower presenteeism. Conclusions: Employment status is related to measures of well-being, which are also associated with absenteeism and presenteeism. © 2014 by American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.","","Absenteeism; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Employment; Female; Health Behavior; Health Status Indicators; Health Surveys; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Primary Health Care; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; absenteeism; adult; aged; controlled study; employment status; female; health insurance; health survey; human; job performance; male; primary medical care; quality of life; review; self employment; unemployment; United States; absenteeism; adolescent; employment; health behavior; health insurance; health status indicator; middle aged; occupational health; primary health care; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; young adult","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, (U19OH008868); National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH","","Van Der Wees P.J., Zaslavsky A.M., Ayanian J.Z., Improvements in health status after Massachusetts health care reform, Milbank Q, 91, pp. 663-689; Lind D.P., Iowa Employer Benefits Study R, (2012); Merchant J.A., Kelly K.M., Lind D.P., Et al., Iowans Speak Out on Their Health, (2010); Di Tella R., Macculloch R.J., Oswald A.J., Preferences over inflation and unemployment: Evidence from surveys of happiness, Am Econ Rev., 91, pp. 335-341, (2001); Lucas R.E., Clark A.E., Georgellis Y., Diener E., Unemployment alters the set point for life satisfaction, Psychol Sci., 15, pp. 8-13, (2004); Krueger A.B., Mueller A.I., The lot of the unemployed: A time use perspective, J Eur Econ Assoc., 10, pp. 765-794, (2012); Lind D.P., Iowa Employer Benefits Study R, (2010); Integrating Employee Health-A Model Program for NASA, (2005); Schulte P., Vainio H., Well-being at work-overview and perspective, Scand J Work Environ Health, 36, pp. 422-429, (2010); Cherniack M., Henning R., Merchant J.A., Punnett L., Sorenson G.R., Wagner G., Statement of NationalWorkLife Priorities, Amer J Industr Med., 54, pp. 10-20, (2011); SAS/STATR- 9.2 User's Guide: Survey Data Analysis (Book Excerpt), (2009); Databases, Tables & Calculators by Subject, (2013); Health-Related Qualityof-Life 14-Item Measure, (2013); The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPs) Clinician and Group Survey: Submission to National Quality Forum, (2009); Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Questionnaire, (2010); 2000 Census, C.

The stents were removed 2 weeks after placement. The rabbits were allowed to grow for six months, at which time they were killed and the larynges were studied. Average, minimal, and maximal subglottal cross-sectional areas were calculated for each animal and adjusted for weight. The cricoid quarter section group had significantly greater average, minimal, and maximal subglottal cross-sectional areas compared to controls and significantly greater minimal and maximal cross-sectional areas compared to the anterior-posterior cricoid split group. The anterior-posterior cricoid split group and the control group did not significantly differ with respect to any of the three parameters. The results indicate that anterior-posterior cricoid split and cricoid quartersection do not adversely affect subglottic growth. Cricoid quartersectioning was superior to the anterior-posterior cricoid split in its ability to expand subglottic airway dimension. © 1991, SAGE Publications.

Twelve 1-kg guinea pigs were divided into two groups. In group 1 were six animals undergoing tissue expansion without anticontractile agents, and in group 2 were six animals treated with a saturated solution of papaverine prior to expansion. Laser-Doppler velocimetry was used to monitor the changes in blood perfusion that occurred with each expansion. Animals pretreated with papaverine (group 2) maintained higher blood flow following inflation of the expander than untreated animals (group 1). This study provides physiologic evidence of the benefits of pharmacologic enhancement of the expansion process. Agents of this type may have a future role in the prevention of ischemic complications. © 1991, SAGE Publications.

Many agreed that there were two kinds of native peoples on the Pacific Islands, sometimes labeled as ""Polynesians"" (including Micronesians) and ""Melanesians"" and now more often as ""Austronesians"" and ""Papuans."" Furthermore, it was said that these two peoples had arrived in the Pacific during two separate periods of settlement. Some questioned the simplicity of this story, but it continued to dominate how many thought about the islanders and their past. The simplicity of this chronicle masks its deficiencies as a framework for understanding human diversity and prehistory in the Pacific. It is not just simple, it is too simple. It is also based on unrealistic assumptions about the character and differentiation of human populations. © 2001 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

The device works by applying a mild holding pressure to the most anterior and posterior prominences, where growth is not desired, while encouraging growth in adjacent flattened regions. Although this technique has been successfully used to treat infants as young as 3 months of age, it is often assumed that decreasing cranial growth and increasing cranial rigidity prohibit treatment in infants older than 1 year of age. The authors' experience with older infants suggests the contrary. Through a series of case reports, they present evidence that this treatment remains viable during the 2nd year of life and that improvement has been observed in infants in whom treatment has been initiated as late as 18 months. These examples certainly suggest that additional prospective studies are warranted.","","Abnormalities; Age Factors; Craniosynostoses; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Orthotic Devices; Plagiocephaly, Nonsynostotic; Pressure; Skull; Treatment Outcome; age; article; case report; congenital malformation; craniofacial synostosis; female; growth, development and aging; human; infant; male; orthotics; plagiocephaly; pressure; skull; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","T.R.

Eighty, 8-week-old, purebred beagle dogs were assigned randomly to four groups: (1) unoperated dogs as a group control; dogs in which the mid-third of the palate was surgically removed and (2) left unrepaired (unrepaired controls); (3) repaired with mucosal flaps; (4) repaired with mucoperiosteal flaps. Five animals from each group were killed at 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery and coronal sections examined under light microscopy. Among the animals with complete soft tissue healing, 8 of 12 dogs from Group 2, 11 of 20 from Group 3, and 10 of 19 from Group 4 showed complete bone regeneration. No significant differences were found overall in bone thickness and bone density measurements between Group 3 and Group 4. Histologically, a well-differentiated periosteum was present on the maxilla at 4 weeks, even in animals in which the periosteum had not been preserved in the original flap. These results suggest that maintaining the periosteum at surgical closure does not influence bone regeneration in beagles up to 12 weeks of age. We suggest that osteoprogenitor cells, migrating from the undisturbed local periosteum adjacent to the defect, were responsible for the new bone growth in our study.","beagle dog; bone regeneration; mucoperiosteum; palate repair; palatoplasty; periosteum","Analysis of Variance; Animal; Bone Density; Bone Regeneration; Disease Models, Animal; Dogs; Female; Male; Maxillofacial Development; Mouth Mucosa; Osteogenesis; Palate; Periosteum; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Surgical Flaps; adolescent; animal model; animal tissue; article; bone defect; bone density; bone growth; bone regeneration; cheek mucosa; controlled study; dog; histology; maxilla; nonhuman; palate disease; palatoplasty; periosteum graft; priority journal; soft tissue; stem cell","","","","","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (P01DE005837); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR","","","","","","","","","","","10556656","","CPJOE","7605790","English","CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFAC.

Five one-kilogram albino Hartley guinea pigs were implanted with commercially available hemispheric expanders. The expanders were inflated every 3 days on four successive occasions. Blood flow measurements were taken on each animal just before each inflation, immediately after inflation, and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 hours after expansion. Measurement of flow changes immediately after each inflation of the expander showed that, initially, blood flow in the tissue overlying the expander recovered quickly, but as the expansion process was continued, the flow did not return to baseline values so rapidly. This might be an indication that tissue expansion in patients could be carried out more rapidly during the initial inflations, with increasing recovery periods between inflations as the expansion process continued.","","animal experiment; animal model; blood flow; clinical article; conference paper; Doppler flowmetry; guinea pig; laser; nonhuman; priority journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01945998","","OTOLD","2148973","English","OTOLARYNGOL.

As such, the condition is best described as deformational plagiocephaly-brachycephaly with isolated plagiocephaly and/or isolated brachycephaly being at either ends of the spectrum. Due to its symmetric appearance, deformational brachycephaly is often incorrectly dismissed as being less concerning, and it has sometimes erroneously been reported that brachycephaly cannot be treated successfully with a cranial orthosis. We prospectively report on 4205 infants with isolated deformational brachycephaly treated with a cranial orthosis from 2013 to 2017. These results demonstrate that the orthosis is successful in the treatment of deformational brachycephaly with an 81.4% improvement toward normal (95.0 to 89.4) in cephalic index. We furthermore demonstrate that entrance age influences treatment results, with younger infants demonstrating both improved outcomes and shorter treatment times. © The Author(s) 2018.","cephalic index;

For many prehistorians the distribution of Lapita sherds identifies the expansion of Austronesian‐speaking populations through Oceania. This article addresses the Lapita language question by exploring the implications of the relationship among gamma globulin (Gm) genetics, paleoenvironments, malaria, natural selection, and prehistoric settlement patterns. Archeological sites with Lapita ceramics are consistently located in coastal lowlands, which in some parts of Oceania would have been malarious areas. Drawing on recent evidence that Austronesian‐speaking populations in Near Oceania possess a genetic advantage over Non‐Austronesian speakers with regard to malaria, we contend that Austronesian speakers have been able to occupy—on a permanent basis—malarious coastal lowlands that were detrimental to Non‐Austronesian speakers. It follows, therefore, that the inhabitants of those Lapita sites spoke one or more of the Austronesian languages. 1993 American Anthropological Association","","Pacific; archaeological evidence; ceramic style;

This system is intended to replace the manual plaster-casting technique currently used during the process of fabricating cranial remodeling bands. The system uses 18 triangulated digital cameras and the projection of random infrared patterns to capture a 360° image of an infant’s cranium instantaneously, including the face and top of the head. Accuracy was calculated by comparing models digitized with this system with the same models digitized with high-precision inspection equipment. Safety was documented under guidelines established by the American Council of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. Images were acquired in 0.008 seconds and processed for viewing in software within 2.5 minutes. Accuracy was calculated to be ±0.236 mm. Hazard analysis confirmed the system to be safe for direct continuous exposure. The data acquired may be viewed as a point cloud, wire frame, or surface on which a digital photograph (ie, texture) is automatically overlaid. Physical models are created by exporting the digital data to a multiaxis milling machine or stereolithography machine. Quantitative data (linear and surface measurements, curvature, and volumes) can be obtained directly from the digital data. The cranial imaging system is a safe and accurate method of obtaining digital 3D images of an infant’s cranium. Along with the obvious clinical and manufacturing benefits, it also has significant potential as a research tool for documenting the natural history and evaluating the treatment of plagiocephaly. © 2004 Mutaz B.

A Total Worker Health (TWH) Research MethodologyWorkshop was convened to discuss research methods and future needs. Methods: Twenty-six experts in occupational safety and health and related fields reviewed and discussed current methodological and measurement issues and those showing promise. Results: TWH intervention studies face the same challenges as other workplace intervention studies and some unique ones. Examples are provided of different approaches and their applications to TWH intervention studies, and desired developments in the TWH literature. Conclusions: This report discusses and outlines principles important to building the TWH intervention research base. Rigorous, valid methodologic, and measurement approaches are needed for TWH intervention as well as for basic/etiologic, translational, and surveillance research. © Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.","Health;

The populational and familial patterns of this disorder suggest genetically based, immune incompetence. In Papua New Guinea, the disease occurs among populations characterized by high frequencies of IGHG3 G haplotypes. Elsewhere, the distribution and prevalence of hyperreactive malarious splenomegaly is consistent with the distributions of IGHG3 alleles. Drawing upon this relationship, I suggest that expression of the G3M G phenotype is a necessary precondition for hyperreactive malarious splenomegaly, consistent with the pathogenesis of malaria and the functions of the immune system.","","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; antigen expression; article; haplotype; human; hypothesis; immune deficiency; malaria; Papua New Guinea; pathogenesis; phenotype; priority journal; splenomegaly","","immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6","","","","","Bryceson A.D.M., Fakunle Y.M., Fleming A.F., Et al., Malaria and splenomegaly, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 77, (1983); Fakunle Y.M., Greenwood B.M., Metabolism of IgM in the tropical splenomegaly syndrome, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 70, pp. 346-348, (1976); Marsden P.D., Crane G.G., The tropical splenomegaly syndrome: A current appraisal, Rev Inst Med Trop São Paulo, 18, pp. 54-70, (1976); Ziegler J.L., Cryoglobulinaemia in tropical splenomegaly syndrome, Clin Exp Immunol, 15, pp. 65-78, (1973); Crane G., Recent studies of hyperreactive malarious splenomegaly (tropical splenomegaly syndrome) in Papua New Guinea, PNG Med J, 29, pp. 35-40, (1986); Crane G.G., The serology of tropical splenomegaly syndrome and its relationship to malaria, Role of the Spleen in the Immunology of Parasitic Diseases, pp. 245-258, (1979); Fakunle Y.M., Tropical splenomegaly.

Several neurotoxic PCBs are chiral and undergo atropisomeric enrichment in vivo due to atropselective metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Here we study how the liver-specific deletion of the cytochrome P450 reductase (cpr) gene alters the toxicokinetics of 2,2′,3,3′,6,6′-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 136) in mice. Male and female mice with a liver-specific deletion of cpr (KO) and congenic wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to a single oral dose of racemic PCB 136 (6.63 mg/kg). Levels and chiral signatures of PCB 136 and its hydroxylated metabolites were determined 1-48 h after PCB exposure in whole blood. Blood levels of PCB 136 were typically higher in M-WT compared to F-WT mice. At the later time points, F-KO mice had significantly higher PCB 136 levels than F-WT mice. 2,2′,3′,4,6,6′-Hexachlorobiphenyl-3-ol (3-150), 2,2′,3,3′,6,6′-hexachlorobiphenyl-4-ol (4-136), 2,2′,3,3′,6,6′-hexachlorobiphenyl-5-ol (5-136), and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,2′,3,3′,6,6′-hexachlorobiphenyl (4,5-136) were detected in blood, with 5-136 and 4-136 being major metabolites. At later time points, the sum of HO-PCB (ςHO-PCB) levels exceeded PCB 136 levels in the blood; however, higher ςHO-PCB than PCB 136 levels were observed later in KO than WT mice. PCB 136 and its major metabolites displayed atropisomeric enrichment in a manner that depended on the time point, sex, and genotype. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed sex and genotype-dependent differences in toxicokinetic parameters for PCB 136 atropisomers and its metabolites. The results suggest that mice with a liver-specific deletion of the cpr gene can potentially be used to assess how an altered metabolism of neurotoxic PCB congeners affects neurotoxic outcomes following exposure of the offspring to PCBs via the maternal diet. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","","Animals; Kinetics; Liver; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Molecular Structure; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; cytochrome P450 reductase; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ferrihemoprotein reductase; animal experiment; Article; comparative study; controlled study; enantioselectivity; female; gene deletion; genotype; hydroxylation; liquid liquid extraction; liver metabolism; liver microsome; male; maternal nutrition; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; protein expression; toxicokinetics; animal; chemical structure; chemistry; drug effect; kinetics; knockout mouse; liver; metabolism","","cytochrome P450 reductase, 9039-06-9, 9075-42-7; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ferrihemoprotein reductase, 9023-03-4; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase, ; Polychlorinated Biphenyls, ","","","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, (P30ES006694)","","ATSDR's Substance Priority List, (2017); Stockholm Convention; Herkert N.J., Jahnke J.C., Hornbuckle K.C., Emissions of tetrachlorobiphenyls (PCBs 47, 51, and 68) from polymer resin on kitchen cabinets as a non-Aroclor source to residential air, Environ.

The study presently has 1,005 participating households, stratified into three distinct groups (town, rural non-farm, and farm households) based on the location of the dwelling or home. Participating households receive a medical screening at the medical clinic, located in the county seat. An environmental evaluation is conducted at the residence or farm, consisting of a combination of personal interviews, walk-through observations, and the measurement of a limited number of environmental parameters. Older homes are associated with the use of lead paint, ungrounded electrical systems, asbestos-containing building materials or insulation, and the presence of lead pipe or lead solder in the drinking water system. Approximately 69% of the dwellings in the Keokuk County Rural Health Study were constructed prior to 1970. Twenty percent were constructed prior to 1900. Carbon monoxide measurements ranged from 1 to 9 ppm in 19% of the households. Three homes had carbon monoxide concentrations exceeding 50 ppm. Twenty percent of households had no grounded outlets in high-risk basement or bathroom areas. While nearly 80% of the surveyed households had at least one smoke detector in the home, only 63% of the residences had a minimum of one operating smoke detector. Forty-one percent of households had a water temperature in excess of 130°F and 18 households had water temperatures in excess of 150°F, posing a risk for burns and scalding. By promoting a partnership between the academic and local communities, the Keokuk County Rural Health Study can assist local citizens in addressing numerous public health issues. Programs underway include increasing community awareness of the importance of the use of seat belts and child restraints, correct placement and testing of smoke alarms, fall prevention, protecting the public from carbon monoxide poisoning, avoiding burns from hot water, and identifying electrical hazards.","","Accidents; Carbon monoxide; Farms; Fire protection; Health care; Health hazards; Houses; Risk assessment; Rural areas; Smoke detectors; Toxic materials; Exposure assessment; Rural health study; Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","ASAE","","","","","","10747583","","JASHF","","English","J Agric Saf Health","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033301001"

Since the introduction of minimally invasive surgical techniques in thoracic surgery in 1990, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become the approach for many thoracic operations. The role of VATS has slowly evolved but has not been dearly defined. To better understand the role of VATS, we undertook a survey of practicing thoracic surgeons. Methods. a questionnaire was sent to members of the General Thoracic Surgery Club asking the role of VATS in their practice and their opinions regarding appropriate applications, advantages, and limitations of the approach. Results. Two hundred of the 229 members 187.3%) responded to the questionnaire. In this largely academic (66.3%) group of thoracic surgeons, 72% of whom had more than 10 years experience in general thoracic surgery, VATS was the preferred approach (>50% response) for the management of pleural disease, lung biopsy, recurrent pneumothorax, and sympathectomy. A majority of respondents thought that VATS was an acceptable approach for the diagnosis of the indeterminate pulmonary nodule and of anterior and posterior mediastinal masses, and for the management of early empyema, clotted hemothoraces, secondary pneumothorax, limited lung cancer treatment, and benign esophageal disease. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was thought to be unacceptable or investigational by a majority for thymectomy, lobectomy, and lung volume reduction operations. Video-assisted thoracic surgery still represents only a small portion of the thoracic procedures performed, but there is a gradual increase in its rate of use, although 38.1% expressed concern regarding overuse. The main limitation was thought to be in the management of oncologic disease. Conclusions. It appears that VATS is a valuable addition to the practice of thoracic surgery, but significant limitations exist. Although there appear to be many specific indications defined, there is still a significant evolutionary component.","","Attitude of Health Personnel; Endoscopy; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Physicians; Technology, Medical; Thoracic Surgery; Thoracoscopy; Video Recording; article; priority journal; questionnaire; thorax surgery; united states; videorecording","","","","","","","MacK M.J., Aronoff R.J., Acuff T.E., Douthit M.B., Bowman R.T., Ryan W.H., The present role of thoracoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the chest, Ann Thorac Surg, 54, pp. 403-409, (1992); Roviaro G., Major pulmonary resections: Pneumonectomies and lobectomies, Ann Thorac Surg, 56, pp. 779-783, (1993); Naunheim K.S., MacK M.J., Hazelrigg S.R., Et al., Safety and efficacy of VATS techniques for the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 109, pp. 1198-1204, (1995); Landreneau R.J., Hazelrigg S.R., MacK M.J., Et al., Postoperative pain-related morbidity: Video assisted thoracic surgery versus thoracotomy, Ann Thorac Surg, 56, pp. 1285-1289, (1993); Walsh G.L., Nesbitt J.C., Tumor implants after thoracoscopic resections of metastatic sarcoma, Ann Thorac Surg, 59, pp. 215-216, (1995); Fry W.A., Siddiqui A., Pensler J.M., Et al., Thoracoscopic implantation of cancer with a fatal outcome, Ann Thorac Surg, 59, pp. 42-45, (1995); Miller J.I.

Seventy-six purebred beagles were divided into five groups. Two of these groups were controls (unoperated and unrepaired animals); the three remaining groups were experimental (in one group only the lip was repaired, in another only the palate was repaired, and in the last the lip and palate were repaired simultaneously). Cephalometric measurements were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. In multivariate analysis, stepwise multiple regression and discrimination were applied to precisely assess the effects of the various surgical procedures. The results of this study indicate that simultaneous lip and palate repair results in more severe craniofacial growth aberrations than lip repair or palate repair performed separately. © 1988 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.","","Animal; Cephalometry; Cleft Lip; Cleft Palate; Dogs; Malocclusion; Mandible; Maxilla; Maxillofacial Development; Nose; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; animal experiment; animal model; cleft lip; cleft lip face palate; cleft palate; dog; nonhuman; skull development","","","","","","","Farina R., Bec-de-lèvre unilateral total: Correction de la grave déformité du palais et de la lèvre dans même séance opératoire [cheiloplastie (Le Mesurier) et gnato-urano-staphyloplastie (Veau-Ernst)], Ann.
