The primary source of data for this study was face-to-face interviews of 302 respondents from 10 study sites in two earthquake-affected districts. Information collected through four focus group meetings was also used to supplement the survey data. The performance or effectiveness of relief operations was measured by developing an additive composite index score. Both disaggregated and aggregated scores reveal that the emergency materials provided to the earthquake survivors in Nepal were appropriate and adequate for their needs and the aid distribution was relatively fair and timely. Analyses of survey data further suggest that the emergency aid was uniformly distributed among respondents of the two selected districts. Based on the study findings, we provide several recommendations to improve relief operations in future disasters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Appropriate and adequate disaster aid; Emergency relief operation; Fair and timely distribution; Government and nongovernmental organization; Nepal earthquake survivors","Nepal; disaster relief; earthquake event; earthquake magnitude; international aid; nongovernmental organization; survey","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1547554)","This research was supported by National Science Foundation’s RAPID (Award Number 1547554) Grant to study contribution of linking networks in disbursing emergency assistance among 2015 Nepalese earthquakes survivors.

How to reduce and avoid earthquake injuries has remained a major concern for disaster managers and policy-makers. With this motivation, this study examines the injury rates at the district level and identifies the major factors responsible for the rates caused by Nepal’s two major earthquakes in 2015. Using secondary data, the injury rates were analyzed by the application of One Way Analysis of Variance and by identifying the factors of earthquake injury through two regression models—ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR). In both global (OLS) and local (GWR) models, we included seven independent variables, and the OLS regression identified three statistically significant determinants of 2015 earthquake injury rates in Nepal. Although the global model and local model coefficients are harmonious over Nepal, our results show that the GWR model performs better than the OLS model. Based on the major findings of this study, we conclude that improving the built environment in Nepal by enforcing strict building codes can substantially reduce injuries and collapse of buildings due to earthquakes in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Determinants; Earthquake; GWR; Injury rates; Nepal; OLS","Nepal; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Regression analysis; Determinant; Geographically weighted regression; Geographically Weighted Regression modelling; Injury rate; Local regression models; Major events; National level; Nepal; Ordinary least squares; Ordinary least squares regressions; disaster management; earthquake event; injury; natural disaster; spatiotemporal analysis; Earthquakes","","","","","","","Alexander D., Death and injury in earthquakes, Disaster, 9, 1, pp. 57-60, (1985); Alexander D., Natural disasters, Chapman & Hall Inc, (1993); Armenian H.K., Noji E.K., Oganesian A.P., A case-control study of injuries arising from the earthquake in Armenia, 1988, Bulletin of World Health Organization, 70, pp. 251-257, (1992); Armenianmelkonian H.K.A., Deaths and injuries due to the earthquake in Armenia: A cohort approach, International Journal of Epidemiology, 26, pp. 806-813, (1997); Awais S., Saeed A., Ch A., Use of external fixators for damage-control orthopaedics in natural disasters like the 2005 Pakistan earthquake, International Orthopaedics, 38, pp. 1563-1568, (2014); Bartels S.A., VanRooyen M.J., Medical complications associated with earthquakes, Lancet, 379, pp. 748-757, (2012); Bourque L.B., Siegel J.M., Kano M., Wood M.M., Morbidity and mortality associated with disasters, Handbook of Disaster Research, pp. 97-112, (2007); Brunsdon C., Fotheringham S.A., Charlton M., Geographically weighted regression: A method for exploring spatial nonstationarity, Geographical Analysis, 28, pp. 281-298, (1996); National Population and Housing Census 2011, (2012); Chaudhary A.K., Unfolding foreign aid and its contribution to disaster resilience: A case of earthquake 2015 in Nepal, University of Antwerp, (2020); Chaulagain H., Rodrigues H., Silva V., Spacone E., Varum H., Seismic risk assessment and hazard mapping in Nepal, Natural Hazards, 78, pp. 583-602, (2015); Clover A.J., Rannan-Eliya S., Saeed W., Buxton R., Majumder S., Hettiaratchy S.P., James B., Experience of an orthoplastic limb salvage team after the Haiti earthquake: Analysis of caseload and early outcomes, Plastic Reconstruction Surgery, 127, pp. 2373-2380, (2011); Cross R., Nepal earthquake: A disaster that shows quakes don’t kill people, buildings do, The Guardian, (2015); de Bruycker M., Greco D., Lechat M.F., Annino I., De Ruggiero N., Triassi M., The 1980 earthquake in Southern Italy—Morbidity and mortality, International Journal of Epidemiology, 197, pp. 113-117, (1985); DesRoches R., Comerio M., Eberhard M., Mooney W., Rix G.J., Overview of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Earthquake Spectra, 27, pp. S1-S21, (2011); Doocy S., Daniels A., Packer C., Dick A., Kirsch T., The human impacts of earthquakes: A historic review of events 1980–2009 and systematic literature review, Plos Currents: Disasters, (2013); Ellidokuz H., Ucku R., Aydin U.Y., Ellidokuz E., Risk factors for death and injuries in earthquake: Cross-sectional study from Afyon, Turkey, Croatian Medical Journal, 46, pp. 613-618, (2005); Elnashai A.S., Gencturk B., Kwon O.S., Al-Qadi L., Imad Y., Hashash J.R., Roesler S.J., Kim S.H., Jeong J., Dukes J., Valdivia A., (2011); Fotheringham A.S., Charlton M., Brunsdon C., Measuring spatial variations in relationships with geographically weighted regression, Recent Developments in Spatial Analysis, pp. 60-82, (1997); Fotheringham A.S., Brundson C., Charlton M., Geographically Weighted Regression: The Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships, (2002); Fotheringham A.S., Brunsdon C., Charlto M., Geographically weighted regression: The analysis of spatially varying relationships, Geographical Analysis, 28, pp. 281-298, (2003); Gautam D., Cortes G., Reconstruction assistance in rural Nepal after the 2015 Gorkha Nepal earthquake through Aarma Parmah approach: A case study in Bijulikot, Ramechhap District, Progress in Disaster Science, 10, (2021); Giordano N., Luca1 F.D., Sextos A., Cortes F.R., Ferreira C.F., Wu J., Empirical seismic fragility models for Nepalese school buildings, Natural Hazards, 105, pp. 339-362, (2021); Goda K., Pokhrel R.M., Chiaro G., Katagiri T., Sharma K., Wilkinson S., ).

Many researchers hold the view that as a consequence residents of such area have either already migrated to inland locations or intend to so in the near future. We examine the migration of households following a flash flood event that took place in August 2020 and address intentions for future migration in the Lower Meghna Estuary of coastal Bangladesh. The data obtained for this study include 310 household surveys, field observations, and informal discussions with respondents and local people. Based on the analysis of the field data, this empirical research found one household migrated to other district within one year after the event. When the respondents were asked about their future migration intensions, only a tiny proportion, namely 21 (6.77%) households, likely will leave the study area to settle in other districts while the remaining 289 households likely will stay in the Lakshmipur district. This finding challenges the existing narratives about vulnerability to environmentally induced migration. Moreover, it provides evidence of non-migration, which is a new as well as thriving area of investigation in relation to coastal Bangladesh. © 2022 by the authors.

In doing so, city officials introduced two new safety measures and recommended several others. The main objective of this paper is to explore the tornado survivors' compliance with the safety features recommended by the Joplin city authorities. Face-to-face interviews, as well as other methods, were used to survey respondents who were living within the tornado path (damage zones) at the time of the tornado. Results showed that 43 percent of all respondents implemented at least one recommended tornado measure in rebuild or repair their destroyed/damaged homes. Further, it was found that three variables considered here- rebuild or repair, damage zone category, and perceived tornado risk-were all significant contributors to a homeowner's decision to implement recommended tornado safety measures. The paper concludes with a recommendation for expanding tornado safety education among the respondents. © 2015 by the American Geographical Society of New York.","Joplin; May 2011 tornado; Missouri; Recovery and reconstruction; Tornado safety measures","Joplin; Missouri; United States; disaster management; disaster relief; reconstruction; risk assessment; safety; storm damage; tornado","","","","","","","Beito D.T., Smith D.J., Tornado Recovery: How Joplin is Beating Tuscaloosa, Wall Street Journal, (2012); Brock T.V., Paul B.K., Public Response to a Tornado Disaster: The Case of Hoisington, KS, Papers and Proceedings of the Applied Geography Conferences, 26, pp. 343-351, (2003); (2013); Christoplos I., The Elusive 'Window of Opportunity' for Risk Reduction in Post-Disaster Recovery.

Questions addressed were: (1) How do rates of shoreline change vary over the period 2011-2019? (2) Did new revetments effectively halt erosion and what were the magnitudes of erosion change? (3) How have erosion rates changed for shorelines within 1 km of revetments, and (4) How do households perceive revetments? High-resolution Planet Lab imagery was used to quantify shoreline change rates. Analysis of household survey data assessed human perceptions of the revetment's desirability and efficacy. Results revealed high rates of erosion for 2011-2019 with declining erosion after 2013. New revetments effectively halted erosion for protected shorelines. Significant spatial trends for erosion rates existed for shorelines adjacent to revetments. Survey respondents overwhelmingly had positive attitudes about a desire for revetment protection; however, upstream respondents expressed a strong majority perception that revetment acts to make erosion worse. Highlights of the research include integration of remote sensing with social science methods, the timing of the social survey shortly after revetment construction, and results showing significant erosion change upstream and downstream of new revetments. © 2020 by the authors.","Bangladesh delta; Coastal erosion; Human dimensions; Revetment; Shoreline protection","Erosion; Remote sensing; Surveys; High resolution; Household surveys; Human perception; Meghna estuaries; Positive attitude; Science methods; Shoreline change; Shoreline protection; Revetments","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1660447); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding: This research was supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation #1660447.","Sahoo B., Bhaskaran P.K., Multi-hazard risk assessment of coastal vulnerability from tropical cyclones-A GIS based approach for the Odisha coast, J.

At the time of these disasters, a non-party caretaker government (NCG), backed by the national army, was in power in Bangladesh. Although NCGs were in power at least twice before 2007, previous caretaker governments did not experience any major natural disasters during their tenure. This study compares the opinions of flood and cyclone survivors on three important components of the NCG 's emergency response: disaster-relief efforts, provision of emergency medical care, and construction of temporary shelters. Primary data collected from six villages affected by the floods and/or the cyclone reveals that the NCG was unsuccessful in responding to the floods of 2007 but that its response to the cyclone was immediate and overwhelming. This contrasting pattern of emergency response by the NCG is explained, and the author concludes that a well-functioning democracy is necessary to respond adequately to the adverse consequences of natural disasters. © 2011 Publishing, Toronto Canada.","Bangladesh; Caretaker government; Cyclones; Disaster response; Disaster-relief efforts; Floods; Medical care; Temporary shelters","Bangladesh; Ziziphus spina-christi; Ziziphus spina-christi; disaster management; disaster relief; flood; natural disaster; tropical cyclone","","","","","","","Blake G., The gathering storm, OnEarth, 30, 2, pp. 22-37, (2008); Choudhury M.R., Report on the Bangladesh Flood 1998, (1998); Cuny F.C., Disasters and Development, (1983); Cuny F.C., Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh: Damage, Loss and Needs Assessment for Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction, (2008); Super Cyclone Sidr 2007: Impacts and Strategies for Interventions, (2008); Heath M., UN Grants Aid to Bangladesh to Assist 3 Million Hit by Cyclone, (2007); Hossain M.Z., Et al., Impact of tropical cyclone on rural infrastructures in Bangladesh, Agricultural Engineering International, 10, 2, pp. 1-13, (2008); Iqbal K., Flood in Bangladesh: Is Amartya Sen Smiling?, (2007); Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh: Shelter Plan of Action, (2008); Bangladesh: Disaster Preparedness Keeps Post-flood Diarrhoea Fatality Rate Low, (2007); Islam A.K.M., Et al., Flood Inundation Map of Bangladesh Using MODIS Surface Reflectance Data, (2009); Kahn M.E., The Death Toll from Natural Disasters: The Role of Income, Geography, and Institutions, (2003); Kahn M.E., The death toll from natural disasters: The role of income, geography, and institutions, Review of Economics and Statistics, 87, pp. 271-284, (2005); Kumar A., Bangladesh: Care Taker Government on the Offensive, (2007); Mitchell T.T., Cutter S.L., Global Change and Environmental Hazards: Is the World Becoming More Disastrous?, (1997); Cyclone Sidr-Bangladesh, Natural Hazards Observer, 32, 3, (2008); O'Donnell M.R., Bacos D., Bennish M.L., Nutritional response to the 1998 Bangladesh flood disaster: Sphere minimum standards in disaster response, Disasters, 26, 3, pp. 229-241, (2002); Three Months on from Cyclone Sidr-1.3m Bengalis Face Monsoon Rains in Temporary Shelters, (2008); Paul B.K., Coping with the 1996 tornado in Tangail, Bangladesh: An analysis of field data, Professional Geographer, 50, 3, pp. 287-301, (1998); Paul B.K., Relief assistance to 1998 flood victims: A comparison of the performance of the government and NGOs, Geographical Journal, 169, 1, pp. 75-89, (2003); Paul B.K., 2004 tsunami relief efforts: An overview, Asian Profile, 35, pp. 467-478, (2007); Paul B.K., Why relatively fewer people died?

The book uses an integrative approach to address socio-cultural, political and physical components of the disaster process. Human and social vulnerability as well as risk to environmental hazards are explored within the comprehensive context of diverse natural hazards and disasters. In addition to scientific explanations of disastrous occurrences, people and governments of hazard-prone countries often have their own interpretations for why natural disasters occur. In such interpretations they often either blame others, in order to conceal their inability to protect themselves, or they blame themselves, attributing the events to either real or imagined misdeeds. The book contains a chapter devoted to the neglected topic of such reactions and explanations. Includes chapters on key topics such as the application of GIS in hazard studies; resiliency; disasters and poverty; climate change and sustainability and development. This book is designed as a primary text for an interdisciplinary course on hazards for upper-level undergraduate and Graduate students. Although not targeted for an introductory hazards course, students in such a course may find it very useful as well. Additionally, emergency managers, planners, and both public and private organizations involved in disaster response, and mitigation could benefit from this book along with hazard researchers. It not only includes traditional and popular hazard topics (e.g., disaster cycles, disaster relief, and risk and vulnerability), it also includes neglected topics, such as the positive impacts of disasters, disaster myths and different accounts of disasters, and disasters and gender. © 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Most of these languages are used by very few people. With one exception, the remaining forty-nine SIDS have one or more official languages. Slightly over 62 percent of the eighty official languages are those of former colonial rulers. Of the total of 1,500 languages, the Weaver’s minimum positive deviation method identified only 106 as dominant languages. These languages are spoken by more than 96 percent of the population in the SIDS. The data further show that twenty-eight of the fifty SIDS are monolingual and the remaining twenty-two are either bilingual or multilingual. Surprisingly, in many monolingual SIDS, the official language is not the dominant language. The dominant languages of these nations were first categorized as monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual and then were analyzed by their location, area, and population size. No statistically significant variation was found between them. Reasons for these conditions are explained, and future research direction is provided. Key Words: bilingual, dominant languages, monolingual, multilingual, small island developing countries. © 2019, © 2019 by American Association of Geographers.","bilingüe; estados insulares pequeños en desarrollo; idiomas dominantes; monolingüe; multilingüe","developing world; language; small island state","","","","","","","Aikhenvald A.Y., Stebbins T.N., Languages of Papua New Guinea, Vanishing languages of the Pacific, pp. 239-266, (2007); Amano T., Sandel B., Eager H., Bulteau E., Svenning J.-C., Dalagaard B., Rahbek C., Davies R.G., Sutherland W.J., Global distribution and drivers of language extinction risk, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 281, 1793, (2014); Anderson G.D.S., Language hotspots: What (applied) linguistics and education should do about language endangerment in the twenty-first century, Language Education, 25, 4, pp. 273-289, (2011); Bothen A., An analysis of the Basque independence movement and the political position of the Basque Country within the Spanish State, (2014); The world fact book–Field listing: Languages; Chang J.-H., Tropical agriculture: Crop diversity and crop yield, Economic Geography, 53, 3, pp. 241-254, (1977); Coppock J.T., An agricultural atlas of England and Wales, (1971); Cunningham D., Ingram D.E., Sumbuk K., Language diversity in the Pacific: Endangered and survival, (2006); Gavin M.C., (2017); Gavin M.C., Botero C.A., Bowern C., Colwell R.K., Dunn M., Dunn R.R., Gray R.D., Et al., Toward a mechanistic understanding of linguistic diversity, BioScience, 63, 7, pp. 524-535, (2013); Gavin M.C., Stepp J.R., Rapoport’s rule revisited: Geographical distribution of human languages, PLoS ONE, 9, 9, (2014); Glass G.V., Hopkins K.D., Statistical methods in education and psychology., (1995); Harrison D., When languages die: The extinction of the world’s languages and the erosion of human knowledge, (2007); Heller M., Linguistic minorities and modernity, (1999); Heller M., Paths to post-nationalism: A critical ethnography of language and identity, (2011); Henshall J.D., King L.J., Some structural characteristics of peasant agriculture in Barbados, Economic Geography, 42, 1, pp. 74-84, (1966); Hirsch T., Namoumou F., Potentials and benefits of scaling up nationally determined contributions, Enhanced climate action in response to 1.5 °C of global warming: Scaling up nationally determined contributions, pp. 16-27, (2018); Lewis M.P., Ethnologue: Languages of the world, (2009); Mace R., Pagel M., A latitudinal gradient in the density of human languages in North America, Proceedings of Royal Society, London, Series B: Biological Sciences, 261, pp. 117-121, (1995); Martin-Jones M., Blackledge A., Creese A., Introduction: A sociolinguistics of multilingualism for our times, The Routledge handbook of multilingualism, pp. 1-26, (2012); Mikesell M.W., Murphy A.B., A framework for comparative study of minority-group aspirations, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 81, 4, pp. 581-604, (1991); Nettle D., Explaining global patterns of language diversity, Journal of Anthropological Archeology, 17, 4, pp. 354-374, (1998); Nettle D., Linguistic diversity, (1999); Paul B.K., Crop, livestock and enterprise combination patterns of southern Ontario: 1951–1971, (1980); Simons G., (2018); Simons G., Fenning C.D., Ethnologue: Languages of the world, (2017); Sutherland W.J., Parallel extinction risk and global distribution of languages and species, Nature, 423, 6937, pp. 276-279, (2003); Small island developing states: Small islands big(ger)stakes, (2011); Weaver J.C., Crop combination regions for 1919 and 1929 in the Middle West, Geographical Review, 44, 4, pp. 560-572, (1954); Weaver J.C., Crop combination regions in the Middle West, Geographical Review, 44, 2, pp. 175-200, (1954)","B.K.

Anthropologist James Holston eloquently observes: Cities are plugged into the globe of history like capacitors; they condense and conduct the currents of social time’. Urbanisation is an almost universal demographic trend, with some of the poorest regions of the world urbanising the fastest. Urban health as a subfield of research and practice supports at least one major journal and an international scientific society, and in 2009-2010 was the topic of an international research network funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, but researchers who identify themselves with this subfield generally neglect such connections. Governments have responded to external pressures for policy convergence on a model that has been described as the competition state, prioritising promotion of economic activities, whether at home or abroad, which will make firms and sectors located within the territory of the state competitive in international markets’. © Isaac Luginaah and Rachel Bezner Kerr 2015.","","","","","","","","","Ahsan H.A., Argos M., Arsenic and Cancer: A Crisis in Bangladesh, Cancer Prevention, 9, pp. 1-3, (2007); Argos M., Kalra T., Pierce B.L., Chen Y., Et al., A Prospective Study of arsenic Exposure from Drinking Water and Incidence of Skin Lesions in Bangladesh, American Journal of Epidemiology, 174, 2, pp. 185-194, (2011); Argos M., Kalra T., Rathouz P.J., Et al., Arsenic Exposure from Drinking Water, and All-cause and Chronic-Disease Mortalities in Bangladesh (HEALS): A Prospective Cohort Study, Lancet, 376, 9737, pp. 252-258, (2010); Argos M., Rathouz P.J., Kalra T., Pierce B.L., Et al., Dietary B Vitamin Intakes and Urinary Total Arsenic Concentration in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) Cohort, Bangladesh, European Journal of Nutrition, 49, pp. 473-481, (2010); Arsenic Contamination of Groundwater in Bangladesh., (1999); Buncombe A., How the West Poisoned Bangladesh, Independent, (2010); Caldwell B.K., Cadwell J.C., Mitra S.N., Smith W., Tubewells and Arsenic in Bangladesh: Challenging a Public Health Success Story, International Journal of Population Geography, 9, pp. 23-38, (2003); Caldwell B.K., Smith W.T., Lokuge K., Et al., Access to Drinking-water and Arsenicosis in Bangladesh, Journal of Health and Population Nutrition, 24, 3, pp. 336-345, (2006); Cadwell B.K., Cadwell J.C., Mitra S.N., Smith W., Searching for an Optimum Solution to the Bangladesh Arsenic Crisis, Social Science & Medicine, 56, pp. 2089-2096, (2003); Chaudhuri A., Dealing with Arsenic Contamination in Bangladesh, MIT Undergraduate Research Journal, 10, pp. 25-30, (2004); Fazal M.A., Kawachi T., Ichion E., Extent and Severity of Groundwater Arsenic Contamination in Bangladesh, Water International, 26, pp. 370-379, (2001); Hanchett S., Social Aspects of the Arsenic Contamination of Drinking Water: A Revew of Knowledge and Practice in Bangladesh and West Bengal, Selected Papers on the Social Aspects of Arsenic and Arsenic Mitigation in Bangladesh, pp. 1-55, (2006); Hanchett S., Nahar Q., Van Agthoven A., Et al., Increasing Awareness of Arsenic in Bangladesh: Lessons from a Public Education Programme, Health Policy and Planning, 17, pp. 393-401, (2002); Hasnat M.A., Assessment of arsenic mitigation options; adverse pregnancy outcomes due to chronic arsenic exposure; and the impact of nutritional status on development of arsenicosis, Bangladesh.

The book uses an integrative approach to address socio-cultural, political and physical components of the disaster process. Human and social vulnerability as well as risk to environmental hazards are explored within the comprehensive context of diverse natural hazards and disasters. In addition to scientific explanations of disastrous occurrences, people and governments of hazard-prone countries often have their own interpretations for why natural disasters occur. In such interpretations they often either blame others, in order to conceal their inability to protect themselves, or they blame themselves, attributing the events to either real or imagined misdeeds. The book contains a chapter devoted to the neglected topic of such reactions and explanations. Includes chapters on key topics such as the application of GIS in hazard studies; resiliency; disasters and poverty; climate change and sustainability and development. This book is designed as a primary text for an interdisciplinary course on hazards for upper-level undergraduate and Graduate students. Although not targeted for an introductory hazards course, students in such a course may find it very useful as well. Additionally, emergency managers, planners, and both public and private organizations involved in disaster response, and mitigation could benefit from this book along with hazard researchers. It not only includes traditional and popular hazard topics (e.g., disaster cycles, disaster relief, and risk and vulnerability), it also includes neglected topics, such as the positive impacts of disasters, disaster myths and different accounts of disasters, and disasters and gender. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Alexander D., Confronting Catastrophe: New Perspectives on Natural Disasters, (2000); Alexander D., Understanding Hazards and Disasters; Bolin R., Stanford L., Constructing vulnerability in the first world: the Northridge Earthquake in Southern California, pp. 89-112, (1999); Briere J., Elliott D., Prevalence, characteristics, and long-term sequelae of natural disaster exposure in the general population, Journal of Traumatic Stress, 13, 4, pp. 661-679, (2000); Burton I., Kates R.W., The perception of natural hazards in resource management, Natural Resources Journal, 3, pp. 412-441, (1964); Burton I., Et al., The Environment as Hazard, (1978); Butler A.S., Et al., Preparing for the Psychological Consequences of Terrorism: A Public Health Approach, (2003); Chapman D., Natural Hazards, (1999); Charles N., Slater F., Floods: friends or enemies?, Geographical Education, 8, 3, pp. 57-62, (1995); Chowdhury K.M.M.H., Cyclone preparedness and management in Bangladesh, pp. 115-119, (2002); Cohen C., Werker E., natural, 25, (2004); Cutter S.L., Living with Risk: The Geography of Technological Hazards, (1993); Cutter S.L., American Hazardscapes: The Regionalization of Hazards and Disasters, (2001); Cutter S.L., Et al., Revealing the vulnerability of people and places: case study of Georgetown County, South Carolina, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 90, 4, pp. 713-737, (2000); Degg M., Natural disasters: recent trends and future prospects, Geography, 77, 3, pp. 198-209, (1992); Dominici F., Levy J.I., Louis T.A., Methodological challenges and contributions in disaster epidemiology, Epidemiologic Reviews, 27, 1, pp. 9-12, (2005); El-masri S., Tipple G., Urbanisation, poverty and natural disasters: vulnerability of settlements in developing countries, pp. 1-12, (1997); Erickson N.J., Natural Hazards: Basic Concepts; Fellmann J.D., Et al., HumanGeography: Landscapes ofHuman Activities, (2008); Frank K.L., A geographical examination of multiple tornado touchdowns in Kansas, Papers and Proceedings of the Applied Geography Conferences, 21, pp. 323-329, (1998); Fritz C., Disaster, pp. 651-694, (1961); Gad-el-hak M., Facets and scope of large-scale disasters, NaturalHazards Review, 11, 1, pp. 1-6, (2010); Glickman T.S., Et al., Acts of God and acts of man: recent trends in natural disasters and major industrial accidents, (1992); Disaster Assistance Information on Declaration for Urban and Rural Areas, (1995); Grazulis T.P., Significant Tornadoes, 1880-1989: Discussion and Analysis, I, (1991); Guha-sapir D., Et al., Thirty Years of Natural Disasters: 1947-2003: The Numbers, (2004); Haque C.E., Hazards in a Fickle Environment: Bangladesh, (1997); Hewitt K., The idea of calamity in a technocratic age, pp. 3-32, (1983); Hewitt K., Regions of Risk: A Geographical Introduction to Disasters, (1997); Hofer T., Messerli B., Floods in Bangladesh: History, Dynamics and Rethinking of the Role of the Himalayas, (2006); 10th Meeting FAO Field Programme Circular, (1994); World Disaster Report 2007: Focus on Discrimination, (2007); Mauro A., Disaster, communication and public information, pp. 239-246, (2004); McAdoo B.G., Et al., Indigenous knowledge and the near field population response during the 2007 Solomon Islands Tsunami, Natural Hazards, 48, 1, pp. 73-82, (2009); McEntire D.A., Disaster Response and Recovery: Strategies and Tactics for Resilience, (2007); Mesjasz C., Economic vulnerability and economic security, pp. 123-156, (2011); Mileti D.S., Disasters by Design: A Reassessment of Natural Hazards in the United States, (1999); Mitchell J.T., The hazards of one's faith: hazard perceptions of South Carolina Christian Clergy, Environmental Hazards, 2, 1, pp. 25-41, (2000); Mitchell J.T., Prayer in disaster: case study of christian clergy, Natural Hazards Review, 4, 1, pp. 20-26, (2003); Mitchell J.T., Cutter S.L., Global Change and Environmental Hazards: Is the World Becoming More Disastrous?, (1997); Montz B.E., Et al., Hazards, pp. 479-491, (2003); Noji E.K., The Public Health Consequences of Disasters, (1997); Norris F., Et al., 60,000 Disaster victims speak, part 1: a review of the empirical literature, 1981-2001, Psychiatry, 65, pp. 207-239, (2002); Norris F., Et al., 60,000 Disaster victims speak, part 2: summary and implications of the disaster mental health research, Psychiatry, 65, pp. 204-260, (2002); Oliver S., Natural hazards: some new thinking, Geography Review, 14, 3, pp. 2-4, (2001); Paul B.K., Why relatively fewer people died?

Fortunately, such an outbreak did not occur. The objectives of this paper are to examine the extent and pattern of illnesses experienced by Cyclone Sidr survivors in the aftermath of its landfall and to investigate household and individual-level factors associated with such illnesses. Based on face-to-face interviews conducted among 277 randomly selected Sidr survivors living in the four most severely impacted coastal districts, this study found that the post-cyclone incidence of water-borne, respiratory, and other diseases was not unusually high. Only 52 persons suffered Sidr-related illnesses, and their illnesses were significantly associated with household income, and gender and age of the Sidr survivors. A major outbreak of such diseases was largely avoided because of the proper distribution of food and safe drinking water, as well as the timely implementation of health care intervention measures. This important finding will aid relevant authorities in successfully responding to outbreaks of diseases following a future extreme event in Bangladesh and perhaps elsewhere. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Coastal Bangladesh; Cyclone Sidr; Disaster myths; Emergency and public health personnel; Epidemic; Illnesses","Bangladesh; Ziziphus spina-christi; coastal zone; cyclone; disaster management; disease incidence; health care; health impact; household survey; implementation process; public health","","","","","","","Alexander D., Does a link really exist?, Nat Hazards Obs, 22, (1998); Ashley W.S., Spatial and temporal analysis of tornado fatalities in the United States, Weather Forecast, 22, pp. 1880-2995, (2007); Bern C., Et al., Risk factors for mortality in the Bangladesh cyclone of 1991, WHO Bull, 71, 1, pp. 73-78, (1993); Bromet E., Dew M.A., Review of psychiatric epidemiologic research on disaster, Epidemiol Rev, 17, pp. 113-119, (1995); Buekens P., Et al., Hurricanes and pregnancy, Birth Issues Prenat Care, 33, 2, pp. 91-93, (2006); Cordero J.F., The epidemiology of disasters and adverse reproductive outcomes: lessons learned, Environ Health Perspect Suppl, 100, S 2, pp. 131-136, (1993); Curtis A., Leitner M., Geographic Information Systems and Public Health: Eliminating Perinatal Disparity, (2006); Curtis A., Mills J.W., GIS, Human Geography, and Disasters, (2009); de Goyet C.V., Epidemics after natural disasters: a highly contagious myth, Nat Hazards Obs, 31, 3, pp. 4-6, (2007); Dercon S., Krishanan P., Vulnerability, seasonality and poverty in Ethiopia, J Dev Stud, 36, 6, pp. 25-53, (2000); Edgeworth R., Collins A.E., Self-care as a response to diarrhoea in rural Bangladesh: empowered choice or enforced adoption?, Soc Sci Med, 63, 10, pp. 2686-2697, (2006); Fischer III H.H., Response to Disaster: Fact Vs.

Box 4, Thailand","Cyclone Sidr, a Category 4 storm, struck the southwestern coast of Bangladesh on November 15, 2007, causing 3,406 deaths, 2.51 million acres of crop damage, and aggregated damage of US$1.7 billion. It significantly damaged household food availability and increased post-cyclone nutritional insecurity. This study assesses the nutritional status of household and explores influences of various socioeconomic variables on nutritional security. More specifically, it explores the impact of the cyclone on short-term nutritional status of women of reproductive age and children under 5 years. For this study, 331 households living in three villages devastated by Cyclone Sidr were selected. The nutritional status of women of reproductive age was measured based on body mass index, and that of children aged 6-59 months was measured based on weight-for-height (wasting), height-for-age (stunting), and weight-for-age (underweight). This study found that the nutritional status, along with other household characteristics, of the study groups was not remarkably different across the three selected villages. Findings of this study further suggest that the nutritional security situation was not much changed in the post-cyclone period compared with the pre-cyclone period primarily because of rapid and effective distribution of essential food items among cyclone survivors by the government of Bangladesh along with donor and other organizations.

Similarly, fishermen were found to be the most vulnerable to nutritional insecurity in the post-cyclone period.

The EF5 tornado was the deadliest single tornado to occur in the United States since modern record keeping began in 1950, surpassing the tornado of 8 June 1953, which claimed 116 lives in Flint, Michigan. The Joplin tornado death toll was also far higher than the average annual number of deaths caused by tornadoes in the United States between 2000 and 2011. This study analyzed Joplin deaths by damage zone and place of death. Tabular data collected primarily from secondary sources revealed the number of deaths and death rates differ significantly by zone of destruction. The central zone (labeled as ""catastrophic"") had the most deaths, with the number decreasing systematically in both directions from the center of that zone. The results of this study further show that more people died in nonresidential buildings in Joplin than is usual in a U.S. tornado event, calling into question how well such structures protect occupants. Finally, the lack of basements in residential and other structures most likely contributed greatly to the high death toll, although the degree remains uncertain. Several recommendations are offered to reduce future U.S. tornado fatalities. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.","","Missouri; United States; catastrophic event; mortality; population density; spatial analysis; tornado","","","","","","","Alvarez J., In memory of lives lost: Obituaries, 5:41: Stories from the Joplin Tornado, pp. 161-220, (2011); Ashley W.S., Spatial and temporal analysis of tornado fatalitiesin the United States: 1880-2005, Wea.

Using logistic regression models, we analyzed seven predictor variables to identify significant contributors to population recovery, including tornado strength, community size, population trend, and state status (Sunbelt or Snowbelt). The data encompassed 516 tornado-affected communities across the conterminous United States. Our findings revealed that about 55% of the communities experienced no significant population change immediately after the tornado event. However, 44% of the communities witnessed a population decline, and only 11% fully recovered within 2–10 years. Results indicated that community size and trends were pivotal in population recovery. Communities with negative population trends, especially those with fewer than 5,000 residents, faced significant challenges regaining their pre-tornado population size within 1 year. The data did not show a significant difference in population recovery between communities in the Sunbelt and Snowbelt regions. The study highlights the importance of community-level factors in shaping population recovery dynamics following tornado events. Understanding these factors can aid community leaders and disaster managers in formulating effective strategies to retain populations and encourage rapid recovery. Although certain limitations exist due to data availability, future researchers could explore additional factors, such as post-tornado policies and socioeconomic variables, to gain comprehensive insights into post-disaster population dynamics. Our research contributes value to social science disaster research, helping communities build resilience in the face of tornado hazards. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Population; Tornado recovery; Tornadoes","United States; demography; disaster management; recovery plan; tornado","","","","","","","Adams H., Why populations persist: mobility, place attachment, and climate change, Popul Environ, 37, 4, pp. 429-448, (2016); Balland P.A., Rigby D., The geography of complex knowledge, Econ Geogr, 93, 1, pp. 1-23, (2017); Berke P.R., Kartez J., Wenger D., Recovery after disasters: achieving sustainable development, mitigation, and equity, Disasters, 17, 2, pp. 93-109, (1993); Birkmann J., Buckle P., Jaeger J., Pelling M., Setiadi N., Garschagen M., Fernando N., Kropp J., Extreme events and disasters: a window of opportunity for change?

This study was designed to observe the sexual and urinary dysfunction in both sexes of the patients suffering from cancer of the lower third of the rectum managed by surgical intervention with preservation of sphincter. A comparative study was carried out on 54 patients with low rectal cancer who underwent ultra-low anterior resection in the department of surgery, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka from January, 2009 to December, 2010. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the tumor distance from anal verge. Thirty one (57%) patients were in Group A (Experimental) where tumor distance was 5cm from anal verge and upper 1cm of anal sphincter was sacrificed during surgical intervention. Twenty three (43%) patients were in Group B (Control) where tumor distance was 6cm from anal verge and whole length (4cm) of anal sphincter was preserved during surgical intervention. The mean±SD age of the patients was 45.96±14.41 years. During surgery, ultra low anterior resection was performed to remove the tumor in all patients and for anastomosis double stapling technique was performed in 52(96%) patients and hand sewn technique was performed in 2(4%) patients irrespective of tumor distance from anal verge. Covering ileostomy was fashioned in all but one patient. During post-operative follow up Sexual activity in both groups of male patients (Potency, P=0.17; ejaculation; satisfaction and loss of libido, P=0.15) and in female patients (Satisfaction and loss of libido, P=0.15) was not significantly hampered following surgery. Urinary function was assessed by incontinence, increased frequency (P=0.54) and retention (n=0) which were not impaired significantly following surgery. Sexual and urinary function was not significantly impaired in both sexes after low rectal cancer surgery. Sphincter saving surgery can be performed in a very low rectal cancer with preservation of anal sphincter.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anal Canal; Bangladesh; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Rectal Neoplasms; Sex Factors; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; Treatment Outcome; Urologic Diseases; adolescent; adult; aged; anal canal; Bangladesh; comparative study; female; human; male; middle aged; Postoperative Complications; Rectal Neoplasms; sex difference; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological; treatment outcome; Urologic Diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10224742","","","23982531","English","Mymensingh Med J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893109858"

Peak expiatory flow rate (PEFR) is a lung function test which is easily measurable and reproducible but the base line values of PEFR have not been studied in large scale among Bangladeshi children. In Mymensingh municipality out of 79 schools 4 schools were selected purposively. A total of 984 (499 boys and 485 girls, nearly equal in ratio) normal children (6-15 years), were selected randomly by using lottery technic in classroom. To obtain peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) mini Wright peak flow meter was used. The highest of three readings was taken as the correct value. Anthropometric parameters including body weight and height were recorded by bathroom scale and stadiometer respectively and body surface area was calculated. According to age interval (10 months) in boys and girls the mean difference of PEFR values showed that among age categories of 6, 7 & 8 years had no significant (p were <0.18, <0.73 and <0.70 accordingly) and all other age categories the mean difference of PEFR between boys and girls had significant (p<0.01). The correlation coefficient (r values) and the level of significance between different anthropometric parameters and PEFR in case of boys and girls were significant (p<0.001). Correlation of height (boys r=0.961 & girls r=0.954) with PEFR was the highest in comparison to other anthropometric parameters (age, sex and body weight). Boys had significantly higher values of PEFR than the girls at any height.","","Adolescent; Anthropometry; Bangladesh; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Peak Expiratory Flow Rate; Reference Values; adolescent; anthropometry; Bangladesh; child; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; multicenter study; peak expiratory flow; reference value","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10224742","","","23982530","English","Mymensingh Med J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893138871"

In addition to crowded and non-hygienic living conditions, bustees in Dhaka have turned into a safe haven for criminals. Considering this, a previous government administration initiated a bustee demolition program in 1999. Confronted by severe resistance, the government finally abandoned this program. However, threat of eviction did not completely disappear from the minds of bustee dwellers. The objectives of this paper are to explore the perceived level of fear of eviction possessed by residents of bustees in Dhaka and to identify the bases of such fear. Data collected through a questionnaire survey suggest that the overwhelming majority of respondents fear eviction and do not want to return to their villages. The survey data reveal that past eviction and previous bustee experience, length of stay in Dhaka, and having close friends/relatives who live in Dhaka are important determinants of respondent fear of eviction. Based on the results of this study, recommendations are made for resettlement of bustee dwellers in Dhaka. Copyright © 2006 by V. H. Winston & Son, Inc.

The cyclone swept across the south-western coast and ripped through the heart of the country from south-west to north-east with 155 m/h (248 km/h) winds, triggering up to 20 feet (6 m) tidal surges (Paul, 2009). Cyclone Sidr originated from a tropical depression in the Bay of Bengal on 11 November 2007 and quickly strengthened, reaching peak sustained winds of 135 m/h (215 km/h). This storm eventually hit offshore islands and made landfall on the south-eastern part of the Sundarbans Forest, and almost one-third of this forest, a world natural heritage site, was totally destroyed. After landfall, Sidr weakened into a tropical storm and dissipated on 16 November 2007 (GoB, 2008a). Cyclone Sidr was one of the ten most devastating cyclones that struck Bangladesh during the 131 years between 1876 and 2007. According to the latest official reports, more than 27 million people in thirty districts suffered damage caused by Sidr, including damage to buildings, roads, bridges, culverts, ferries, embankments and crops (Paul and Dutt, 2010). Of the affected districts, twelve coastal districts were hardest hit by this storm (Figure 17.1). Cyclone Sidr claimed 3,406 lives – strikingly fewer than anticipated, and some 55,000 people sustained physical injuries (GoB, 2008a). An estimated 1.87 million livestock and poultry perished, and crops on 2.4 million acres of land were completely or partially destroyed. In addition, nearly 1.5 million homes and 5,500 miles (8,075 km) of roads were badly damaged or destroyed (GoB, 2008a). The storm also caused power outages that resulted in a near-countrywide blackout lasting more than thirty-six hours (Natural Hazards Center, 2008). © Cambridge University Press 2013.","","","","","","","","","Chughtai S., One Year After Cyclone Sidr: Fear Replaces Hope.

A cross-sectional post-earthquake survey design was adopted to accomplish the objective of this study. Using random sampling, two of the 31 affected districts (Sindhupalchok and Lalitpur) were selected. Five study sites from each of the two districts were selected to administer questionnaire surveys. Focus group meetings and semi-structured formal and informal interviews with key informants were also used to collect relevant data. Building on previous studies, we considered nine risk factors for earthquake injuries in this study: five individual-level factors and four household-level factors. Using a goodness-of-fit chi-square test, we identified statistically significant risk factors of earthquake injuries in Nepal. Our results show that out of the nine factors, one individual-level factor – age – and two household-level factors – monthly income and type of main dwelling – were statistically significant. While long-term efforts to improve the economic conditions of those affected will reduce earthquake injuries, in the short-term, requiring seismic-resilient features in new construction and repairing damaged houses will substantially reduce earthquake injuries. Fortunately, the Nepalese Government has been ensuring that all houses are rebuilt and repaired to earthquake-resistant standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2015 Nepal earthquakes; Cross-sectional survey design; Earthquake injuries; Goodness-of-fit chi-square test; Host characteristics; Risk factors","","","","","","National Science Foundation's; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1547554)","This research was supported by National Science Foundation's RAPID (Award no. 1547554 ) Grant to study contribution of linking networks in disbursing emergency assistance among 2015 Nepalese earthquakes survivors.

Experts suspect that if an earthquake with a 7.0 magnitude occurred in large cities of Bangladesh, there would be a major human tragedy due to the structural failure of many buildings. The primary objectives of this paper are to examine seismic risk perception among residents of Dhaka City and investigate their levels of earthquake preparedness. A questionnaire survey conducted among 444 residents of the city provided the major source of data for the paper. The survey results suggest that an overwhelming majority of the respondents were not prepared for a major earthquake, which is anticipated to occur in Dhaka. Multivariate analysis of survey data reveals that value of residential unit and respondent educational levels appear as the most significant determinants of preparedness status of the respondents.

The book evaluates the current state of disaster relief and discusses how it may be improved. The author examines salient features of disaster relief operations and provides an overview of the development of global humanitarian assistance programs. The book also explores how disaster aid is channelled from non-affected areas to affected areas. Using five major natural and man-made disasters as case studies, the book analyses the nature and extent of emergency relief efforts undertaken for each.

Building permit data was used from May 23, 2011–December 31, 2020, to examine recovery progress based on roof repair building permits (permit for roof repair only), residential and commercial building permits, and demolition permits. Each of the four permit types was plotted on the four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) damage zones, catastrophic, extensive, moderate, and limited, by census block to determine what percentage of total permits were issued in each. Further, data on three permit types (commercial excluded) were plotted in the following combinations: (a) roof repair permits with demolition permits and (b) roof repair permits with residential building permits, plotted on the catastrophic and limited zones only. The goal of the second set of plots was to visualize the 2011 damage path using permit data. Mapping data such as these may help recovery planning through a robust understanding of the relationship between damage and permit issuance as a community enters the restoration phase of the Kates recovery model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Building permit data; Disaster recovery; Disasters; GIS; Joplin tornado; Kates recovery model; Tornadoes","Joplin; Missouri; United States; disaster management; GIS; tornado; visualization","","","","","City of Joplin City Clerk’s Office","The authors acknowledge the City of Joplin City Clerk’s Office for providing the building permit data, and Rhett Mohler at Saginaw Valley State University for assistance with geocoding the data.","Aghababaei M., Koliou M., Pilkington S., Mahmoud H., van de Lindt J.W., Curtis A., Smith S., Ajayakumar J., Watson M., Validation of time-dependent repair recovery of the building stock following the 2011 Joplin Tornado, Nat Hazard Rev, 21, 4, (2020); Alexander D., Principles of emergency planning and management, (2002); Arku G., Mensah K.O., Allotey N.K., Addo Frempong E., Non-compliance with building permit regulations in Accra-Tema city-region, Ghana: exploring the reasons from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, Plan Theory Pract, 17, 3, pp. 361-384, (2016); Brochner J., Gregorowicz-Kipszak J., Gustafsson M., Hagson A., Accelerated planning for urban housing infills: coordination strategies, Eur Plan Stud, 29, 6, pp. 1113-1131, (2021); Burgess D., Ortega K., Stumpf G., Garfield G., Karstens C., Meyer T., Smith B., Speheger D., Ladue J., Marshall T., 20 May 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado: damage survey and analysis, Weather Forecasting, 29, 5, pp. 1229-1237, (2014); Comerio M., Blecher H., Downtime data on residential buildings after the Northridge and Loma Prieta earthquakes, .

Despite a similar magnitude, Sidr claimed far fewer lives than Cyclone Gorky, also a Category IV storm, which struck Bangladesh in 1991 causing an estimated 140,000 fatalities. The relatively low number of deaths experienced with Sidr is widely considered the result of Bangladesh government's efforts to provide timely cyclone forecasting and early warnings, and successful evacuation of coastal residents from the projected path of Cyclone Sidr. Using information collected from both primary and secondary sources, this study identified several other reasons for the unexpectedly lower mortality associated with Cyclone Sidr relative to Cyclone Gorky. Fewer casualties may be attributed to a number of physical characteristics of Cyclone Sidr, such as duration of the storm and storm surge, landfall time and site, varied coastal ecology, and coastal embankment. This article recommends improvements to the cyclone warning systems, establishment of more public cyclone shelters, and implementation of an education campaign in coastal areas to increase the utilization of public shelters for future cyclone events. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Coastal Bangladesh; Cyclone Gorky; Cyclone Sidr; Early warning systems; Evacuation orders; The Sundarbans","Asia; Bangladesh; Eurasia; South Asia; Ziziphus spina-christi; coastal zone; cyclone; disaster management; early warning system; mortality; natural disaster; storm surge; weather forecasting","","","","","College of Arts and Sciences and Provost Office; Natural Hazards Center; University Colorado-Boulder; Kansas State University, KSU; Natural Hazards Center, University of Colorado Boulder","Funding text 1: Information used in this article was drawn from both primary and secondary sources.

This study focuses on understanding what makes female college students (ages 18-24) in Kolkata, India willing to comply with HIV/AIDS preventive measures; these students are widely believed to be at low risk of infection with HIV. Through a questionnaire survey, the data used in this study was collected from 232 female students attending five higher education institutes. Multiple regression analysis reveals that religion, household income, perception of whether preventive measures would hamper freedom, and respondents' perception of the effectiveness of preventive measures all influence the students' willingness to comply with preventive measures. Based on its findings, the study makes several recommendations to improve HIV/AIDS prevention in Kolkata and West Bengal, India. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Affirmative score; Female college students; HIV/AIDS preventive measures; India; Kolkata; Modes of HIV transmission; West Bengal","","","","","","","","Overview of HIV and AIDS in India, (2007); India HIV/AIDS Statistics, (2010); Who is affected by HIV and AIDS in India?, (2012); Overview of HIV and AIDS in India, (2012); Bailey A., Hutter I., Cultural heuristics in risk assessment of HIV/AIDS, Culture Health & Sexuality, 8, 5, pp. 465-477, (2006); Bandura A., Social Learning Theory, (1977); Bowes J.E., Communication and community development for health information: Constructsand models for evaluation, (1997); Report of Census 2001, (2001); Choubey K., Epidemic scenario of HIV/AIDS in India, Everyman's Science, 40, 1, pp. 30-35, (2007); Craddock S., Kalipeni E., Oppong J.R., Ghosh J., Et al., Beyond epidemiology: Locating AIDS in Africa, HIV and AIDS in Africa: Beyond Epidemiology, (2004); Ghosh J., A geographical perspective on HIV/AIDS in India, Geographical Review, 92, 1, pp. 114-126, (2002); Ghosh D., Predicting vulnerability of India women to domestic violence incident, Research & Practice Social Sciences, 3, 1, pp. 48-72, (2007); Ghosh J., Wadhwa V., Kalipeni E., Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS among women of reproductive age in the slum of Delhi and Hyderabad, Social Science and Medicine, 68, 4, pp. 638-642, (2009); National Family Health Survey, India, 2005-2006: State Reports Delhi and Andhra Pradesh, (2008); Jurich J.A., Adams R.A., Schulenberg J.E., Factors related to behavior change in response to AIDS, Family Relations, 41, 1, pp. 97-103, (1992); Lambert H., Wood K., A comparative analysis of communication about sex, health and sexual health in India and South Africa: Implications for HIV prevention, Culture, Health & Sexuality, 76, 6, pp. 527-541, (2005); MacNaughton G., Women's human rights related to health-care services in the context ofHIV/AIDS, (2004); Mansfield E.R., Helms B.P., Detecting multicollinearity, The American Statistician, 36, 3, pp. 158-160, (1982); UNGASS India Report.

The Sundarbans has been severely affected by sea level rise, salinity intrusion, increasing sea surface temperature, rainfall variability, storm surges, increased frequency of river flood, storms, over- siltation of the rivers, soil erosion, and island subsidence. In addition, the Bay of Bengal coast is a breeding place of tropical cyclones in the World. This chapter is primarily an extensive literature review on the climate change-induced environmental hazards and their impact on the ecosystem and human livelihoods in the Sundarbans of India and Bangladesh. In addition, this chapter also provides a detailed account of the recent cyclonic storm Aila that had hit the Bay of Bengal coast in 2009, the loss suffered, and the emergency relief operations that were undertaken. Finally, the structural and non-structural adaptation measures to environmental degradation and sudden onset disasters like storms, as well as, some cyclone mitigation strategies to reduce life loss and damage from future cyclones have been suggested in this chapter. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptation; Climate change; Emergency relief operation; Environmental degradation; Tropical cyclone","","","","","","","","Afifi T., Warner K., The Impact of Environmental Degradation on Migration Flows across Countries., (2008); Aggarwal A., Cycloneresistant Building Architecture, (2007); Ahmed N., Diana J.S., Coastal to inland: Expansion of prawn farming for adaptation to climate change in Bangladesh, Aquacult Rep, 2, pp. 67-76, (2015); Alam E., Dominey-Howes D., A new catalogue of tropical cyclones of the Northern Bay of Bengal and the distribution and effects of selected land falling events in Bangladesh, Int J Climatol, 35, 6, pp. 801-835, (2014); Allison M.A., Historical changes in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta front, J Coast Res, 14, pp. 1269-1275, (1998); Aulakh R., (2013); Bera M.K., Environmental refugees: A study of involuntary migrants of Sundarban islands, Paper Presented at the 7Th International Conference on Asian and Pacific Coast, (2013); Bhattacharyya R., Sanyal D., Dutta S.K., Et al., Sociodemographic comparison and impact of aila: The super cyclone in Gosaba of West Bengal, Indian J Community Med, 35, 3, pp. 429-432, (2010); Bhunia R., Ghosh S., Water borne cholera outbreak following cyclone aila in Sundarbans area of West Bengal, India, 2009, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 105, pp. 214-219, (2011); Brammer H., Bangladesh’s dynamic coastal regions and sea-level rise, Climate Risk Management, 1, pp. 51-62, (2014); Brammer H., Climate Change, Sea-Level Rise and Development in Bangladesh, (2014); Castles S., Environmental change and forced migration: Making sense of the debate, Development, 70, pp. 1-14, (2002); Chakraborty T.K., Kabir A.H.M.E., Ghosh G.C., Impact and adaptation to cyclone AILA: Focus on water supply, sanitation and health of rural coastal community in the south west coastal region of Bangladesh, J Health Environ Res, 2, 3, pp. 13-19, (2016); Chatterjee N., Mukhopadhyay R., Mitra D., Decadal changes in shoreline patterns in Sundarbans, India.

However, they are also resilient in many ways to natural hazards because they are rich in civic engagement and social capital. Because of the diverse nature of drought’s impacts, understanding its complex dynamics and its effects requires a multidisciplinary approach. To study these dynamics, this research combines appreciative inquiry, the Community Capitals Framework, and a range of climatological monitoring data to assess the 2012–14 Great Plains drought’s effect on McCook, Nebraska. Community coping measures, such as water-use reduction and public health programs, were designed to address the immediate effects of heat and scant rainfall during the initial summer and the subsequent years. Residents generally reported the community was better prepared than in previous droughts, including the persistent multiyear early-2000s drought. However, the results highlight wide variation in community perspectives about the drought’s severity and impacts, as well as divergent experiences and coping responses. Despite these factors, we find evidence of the transformative potential of moving from drought coping to drought mitigation. We attribute the city’s resilience to the ability to draw upon prior experience with droughts, having a formal municipal plan, and strong human and social capital to coordinate individual knowledge and expertise across agencies. We suggest that droughts have served a catalytic function, prompting the community to transform land-use practices, water conservation planning, and built infrastructure in lasting ways. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.","","","","","","","Applications Research Program; Decision and Risk Management Research Center; North Central Regional Center for Rural Development; SARP; University of Nebraska School of Natural Resources; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA","Acknowledgments.

This provided a unique opportunity to study the relationship between rapid-onset disasters and migration decisions of individual households perpetually living under environmental risk. Using Kutubdia Island as a case study, this article examines the migration decisions of respondents in the immediate aftermath of two extreme natural events. Relevant data were primarily collected from a questionnaire survey conducted nearly two months after the occurrence of the event. The study's findings support the view that both environmental and nonenvironmental factors lead to migration.

Relevant data was collected through a questionnaire survey administered among the cyclone victims. Semi-structured interviews with key personnel were also conducted to obtain information regarding the circumstances causing injuries and public response to care for the injured. The questionnaire survey data reveals that among the respondent families, 132 persons sustained various types of injuries. Since the respondent families comprised of 1,443 members, the injury rate was 9.15%. All injured victims were treated either onsite or in local hospitals. The most common types of injuries were soft-tissue injuries (cuts, bruises, and scrapes) and fracture/dislocations. The most common causes of injuries for survivors were associated with falling trees. Analysis of risk factors reveals that age is significantly correlated with injuries. Both formal and informal interviews suggest that injured persons and their family members were in general pleased with medical response they received from various sources. Several recommendations have been suggested to reduce future cyclone-related injuries in Bangladesh. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Coastal Bangladesh; Cyclone Sidr; Falling trees; Injuries; Risk factors; Wind-blown debris","Bangladesh; Ziziphus spina-christi; empirical analysis; injury; natural hazard; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; risk factor; storm damage; tropical cyclone event","","","","","Kansas State University; Natural Hazards Center, University of Colorado Boulder","Acknowledgments I wish to thank the Natural Hazards Center at the University Colorado-Boulder, CO; Dean’s Office, College of Arts and Sciences and Provost Office, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS for funding this study.

The city took the opportunity to build back ""stronger, better, and greener,"" enforcing upgraded codes, requiring city-owned buildings to meet LEED Platinum level standards, and recommending energy-efficiency housing in a new Sustainable Comprehensive Plan. Using information collected from surveys of Greensburg tornado survivors, interviews, and publications, we examined the housing-related recovery, including the emergency provision of temporary shelter and rebuilding permanently. Although temporary shelter kept residents nearby for rebuilding, given the gap between insurance policy limits on the aging housing stock and rebuilding costs, housing affordability is a critical issue in Greensburg's recovery. Local, state, and federal support have made construction of municipal buildings at LEED Platinum level and some affordable and green housing projects possible. However, far greater public and private sector funding for affordable workforce housing, in conjunction with broader economic and job development, is needed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Energy efficient;

To assess of serum total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, to estimate of serum glucose and to establish the association of age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, waist hip ratio and blood pressure of myocardial infarction patients. A total of 120 subjects were included in the study. Among them 60 were subjects of AMI cases and another 60 subjects of non AMI patients as controls. Serum total cholesterol, serum triacylglycerol, serum LDL-Cholesterol & serum HDL-Cholesterol were estimated in each sample. All values were expressed as Mean±SD. Statistical significance of difference between case and control were evaluated by using student's unpaired 't' test. All statistical analysis was done by using SPSS windows package. Past history of diabetes Mellitus and hypertension were more common in cases compared to those in control (p<0.001) which was statistically highly significant. There was no significant difference in the history of smoking between case and control. Statistical mean values of serum triacylglycerol, serum FBS, serum total cholesterol were highly significant in AMI patients in comparison to control (p<0.001). Statistical mean value of HDL-C was significantly decreased in AMI patients in contrast to control (p<0.001). In this study systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were significantly increased in AMI patients in comparison to control (p<0.05). Waist circumference was highly significant in AMI patients in comparison to control (p<0.001). Analyzing the findings of the present study there were significant alteration in lipid profile, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar & WC. These findings reaffirm the clinical importance of the metabolic syndrome as a significant risk factor for AMI. So it may be recommended that estimation of these parameters may help pivotal for better management of AMI.","","Bangladesh; Case-Control Studies; Cholesterol, HDL; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome; Myocardial Infarction; Risk Factors; Triglycerides; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; Bangladesh; case control study; heart infarction; human; metabolic syndrome X; risk factor","","Cholesterol, HDL, ; Triglycerides, ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10224742","","","27941721","English","Mymensingh Med J","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044868143"

Using satellite data at 0.25-degree resolution, spatial patterns of monsoon (June-July-August-September) precipitation variability between 1983 and 2015 within the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basin are analyzed with Principal Component (PC) analysis and the first three modes (PC1, PC2 and PC3) are related to global atmospheric-oceanic fields. PC1 explains 88.7% of the variance in monsoonal precipitation and resembles climatology with the center of action over Bangladesh. The eigenvector coefficients show a downward trend consistent with studies reporting a recent decline in monsoon rainfall, but little interannual variability. PC2 explains 2.9% of the variance and shows rainfall maxima to the far western and eastern portions of the basin. PC2 has an apparent decadal cycle and surface and upper-air atmospheric height fields suggest the pattern could be forced by tropical South Atlantic heating and a Rossby wave train stemming from the North Atlantic, consistent with previous studies. Finally, PC3 explains 1.5% of the variance and has high spatial variability. The distribution of precipitation is somewhat zonal, with highest values at the southern border and at the Himalayan ridge. There is strong interannual variability associated with PC3, related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Next, we perform a hydroclimatological downscaling, as precipitation attributed to the three PCs was averaged over the Pfafstetter level-04 sub-basins obtained from theWorldWildlife Fund (Gland, Switzerland). While PC1 was the principal contributor of rainfall for all sub-basins, PC2 contributed the most to rainfall in the western Ganges sub-basin (4524) and PC3 contributed the most to the rainfall in the northern Brahmaputra (4529). Monsoon rainfall within these two sub-basins were the only ones to show a significant relationship (negative) with ENSO, whereas four of the eight sub-basins had a significant relationship (positive) with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical South Atlantic. This work demonstrates a geographic dependence on climate teleconnections in the GBM that deserves further study. © 2018 by the authors.","Brahmaputra; ENSO; Ganges; Hydroclimate; Meghna; Monsoon; Precipitation; River basin","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Financial data processing; Mechanical waves; Microcomputers; Oceanography; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Rivers; Tropics; Watersheds; Brahmaputra; ENSO; Ganges; Hydroclimate; Meghna; Monsoon; River basins; Principal component analysis","","","","","U.S. National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1660447); National Science Foundation, NSF; East Carolina University, ECU; National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation grant number 1660447.

But some IBS patients may have celiac disease that could be treated by gluten-free diet which will subsequently improve their quality of life. This study was done to see the prevalence of celiac disease among the IBS patients fulfilling Rome III criteria. The present cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology at BSMMU, Dhaka from July 2010 to September 2011. A total of 107 patients aged ranging between 16-60 years clinically labeled as IBS and fulfilled Rome III criteria were included as study sample. The test statistics used to analyze the data were descriptive statistics. The mean age of the patients was 31.5±10.3 years and male to female ratio was roughly 6:1. The mean duration of IBS was 32.0±2.1 months. All of the patients had abdominal discomfort or pain in the preceding 6 months and had a history of loose (mushy) or watery stool, 99.1% had pain or discomfort relieved with defaecation. The prevalence of diarrhoea was found in 78.5% and mixed 21.5% of the patients. About 5% of the patients had raised ESR and majority (86.9%) of the patients had normal level of hemoglobin. Ten (9%) of 107 patients were found positive for anti-t TG (IgA). These findings suggest that an around one-tenth of IBS especially diarrhoea predominant patients may have celiac disease who will respond to simple gluten-free diet thus minimizing the morbidity and mortality. So, all clinically diagnosed IBS patients especially diarrhoea predominant cases should be suggested for the screening for celiac disease.

The overwhelming majority of the victims rebuild their homes in nearby places on the lands of their relatives, friends, and neighbors, while some rebuild homes on government properties. This action is explained using the Community Capital Framework (CCF) and Place Attachment or Sense of Place concepts. The CCF asserts that overall resilience in the face of a disaster comes from focusing on the assets in place prior to the exposure to danger across multiple dimensions such as human, social, political, financial, built, natural, and cultural capitals. These capital assets overlap each other. For example, abundant natural capital can easily translate into financial capital, which, in turn, creates a strong set of built capital, if there is political capital to administer resources. The displaced people in the study area tend to remain in the local area because of strong ties to the surrounding communities and abundant natural resources in terms of availability of potential to re-establish river-based livelihoods, access fresh and formalin free fish and vegetables, and breathe pure air. Local people are known to generously provide free land for building homes, and displaced households often receive financial support from local and national governments. All these resources make for strong ties to the locality, and therefore survivors hesitate to move to distant unknown places. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","","Bangladesh; Meghna Estuary; bank erosion; disaster management; geological hazard; governance approach; livelihood; migration determinant; mobility; river bank; socioeconomic impact","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1660447); National Science Foundation, NSF","This research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation grant number 1660447 .

Despite early cyclone warnings and emergency evacuation orders for coastal residents, thousands of individuals stayed in their homes. This study examines Sidr victims' responses to cyclone warnings and evacuation orders, and explores the factors that would explain why the victims did or did not comply with the orders. Based on survey data collected from 277 Sidr survivors living in the four most severely impacted coastal districts, this study found that more than 75 percent of all respondents were aware of the cyclone warnings and evacuation orders before Sidr's landfall. Despite the efforts of the Bangladesh government, there were lapses in cyclone warnings and evacuation procedures. Field data also reveal several reasons cited by respondents for not complying with evacuation orders. Multivariate analyses of survey data show that trust in warning messages was the most important determinant in the decision to seek refuge in safer shelters, followed by distance to nearest shelter and annual level of education. Several recommendations have been made to improve cyclone warnings and the use of public shelters for similar future events. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","coastal Bangladesh; Cyclone Sidr; cyclone warnings; evacuation orders; public cyclone shelters","Bangladesh; Ziziphus spina-christi; coastal zone; cyclone; disaster management; early warning system; multivariate analysis","","","","","College of Arts and Sciences and Provost Office; Kansas State University, KSU; Natural Hazards Center, University of Colorado Boulder","∗I wish to thank Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder; Dean’s Office, College of Arts and Sciences and Provost Office, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, for funding this study.

This event, which claimed the lives of 162 people, represents the deadliest single tornado to strike the US since modern record-keeping began in 1950. This study examines the factors associated with responses to tornado warnings. Based on a post-tornado survey of survivors in Joplin, it reveals that tornado warnings were adequate and timely. Multivariate logistic regression identified four statistically significant determinants of compliance with tornado warnings: number of warning sources, whether respondents were at home when the tornado struck, past tornado experience, and gender. The findings suggest several recommendations, the implementation of which will further improve responses to tornado warnings. © 2014 The Author(s).

The book presents engineers, scientists, and planners with the necessary tools and planning solutions used to combat coastal vulnerabilities in Bangladesh. Divided into seven chapters, it begins with a critical overview of cyclone and storm surge disasters, focusing on both engineering responses and public preparedness programs to such events. In addition, engineering recommendations are provided for further reduction of their impacts, such as erosion, accretion, and land subsidence, and numerical models are introduced to assess flood induced hazard and risk, flood-induced design loads, and how to intervene in protecting key installations, infrastructures, and communities. Provides engineers, scientists, and planners with the necessary tools and planning solutions they need to address the coastal vulnerabilities presented by floods, cyclones, and storm surge. Includes engineering recommendations on how to reduce coastal hazards and their impact. Explores the topic of sea level rise and the effect of salt water intrusion on fresh water and the surrounding soil. Examines land uses in the coastal zones, their trend, and their effects on coastal zones. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Resilience thinking helps to understand how a particular system works that incorporates both natural phenomena and social perspectives involving with disturbances, surprises, and uncertainty that affect socio-ecological systems. We argue resilience as the capacity of a system to evolve and function in a dynamic way through adaptive cycle where households and communities are linked to the problem of riverbank erosion in Bangladesh. Few studies have been conducted to understand how communities that face enormous threats and challenges related to chronic and acute riverbank erosions in the Bangladesh coastal delta. In this study, we explore and theorize how riverbank erosion impacts Lower-Meghna River basin community and their coping strategies through resilience thinking and adaptive capacities. Information used in this study are collected from questionnaire surveys, Focus Group Meetings (FGMs), and key personnel interviews from Ramgati Upazilla of Lakshmipur District, Bangladesh, which indicate that respondents experience significant household displacement due to riverbank erosion. Respondents were asked about what coping mechanisms they adopted in response to recent riverbank erosions.

Spatial and temporal clustering may be evident in certain data types that can be used to frame the progress of recovery following a disaster. Publically available building permit data from the city of Joplin, Missouri, were gathered for four permit types, including residential, commercial, roof repair, and demolition. The data were used to (1) compare the observed versus expected frequency (chi-square) of permit issuance before and after the EF5 2011 tornado; (2), determine if significant space-time clusters of permits existed using the SaTScan™ cluster analysis program (version 9.7); and (3) fit any emergent cluster data to the widely-cited Kates 10-year recovery model. All permit types showed significant increases in issuance for at least 5 years following the event, and one (residential) showed significance for nine of the 10 years. The cluster analysis revealed a total of 16 significant clusters across the 2011 damage area. The results of fitting the significant cluster data to the Kates model revealed that those data closely followed the model, with some variation in the residential permit data path. © 2022, The Author(s).","Building permit data; Joplin tornado; SaTScan™; Space-time clustering; Space-time permutation model; Tornado recovery","Joplin; Missouri; United States; cluster analysis; data set; hazard assessment; natural hazard; spatiotemporal analysis; tornado","","","","","City Clerk’s Office of Joplin","The authors acknowledge the City Clerk’s Office of Joplin, MO, for providing the permit data used in this research.","Alexander D.E., Principles of emergency planning and management, (2002); Chamlee-Wrightstorr E.L.V.H., The entrepreneur’s role in post-disaster community recovery: Implications for post-disaster recovery policy, Mercatus Policy Series, Policy Primer No. 6.

Because of their recurrent nature and devastating impacts, floods have received significant attention from hazard researchers. However, on a national scale, few rigorous attempts have been made to identify what actually affects flood fatalities. Using a temporal approach, this paper examines the determinants of flood deaths in Bangladesh for the 1972–2013 period. Application of Poisson regression reveals that the extent of the area flooded, the number of people affected by the event, flood duration and frequency, and the interactions of these factors have a significant effect on flood deaths. The study findings may help future flood disaster management in Bangladesh. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bangladesh; Flood fatalities; Floods; Physical parameters; Poisson regression","","","","","","","","Abheuer T., Thiele-Eich I., Braun B., Coping with the impacts of severe flood events in Dhaka’s slum—the role of social capital, Erdkunde, 67, pp. 21-35, (2013); Ahern M., Kovats R.S., Wilkinson P., Few R., Matthies F., Global health impacts of floods: epidemiologic evidence, Epidemiol Rev, 27, pp. 36-46, (2005); Ahmad E., Choudhury J.U., Hassan K.M., Haque M.A., Khan T.A., Rahman S.M.M., Salehin M., Floods in Bangladesh and their processes, Disaster in Bangladesh: selected readings.

The goal of this research is to determine whether regional climate change is occurring and influencing the frequency of tornadic activity occurring in Kansas. Using decadal averages of temperature and precipitation along with decadal tornado totals, we conducted multiple regression analyses to determine if there is a relationship between tornados, precipitation, and temperature from CE 1950 to 2016. We found that four out of seven decades were above the 30-year average of 12.1 degrees Celsius, and six out of seven decades of precipitation were above the 30-year average of 68.42 centimeters. After analyzing the data we found that there is no relationship between tornado frequency, temperature, and precipitation. This study does suggest that further analyses should be conducted to look for other potential patterns. © 2018 by Gamma Theta Upsilon.","Frequency; Precipitation; Regional climate change; Temperature; Tornado","Kansas; United States; climate change; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; regression analysis; temperature anomaly; tornado","","","","","Kansas State University, KSU","The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. John Harrington Jr., Dr. Arnaud Temme, Dr. Shawn Hutchinson, Dr. Audrey Joslin, and Dr. Helene Avocat, and Daniel Ireton for their helpful comments and mentorship.

Following Cyclone Sidr, the Government of Bangladesh has been using 'build back better' as a colloquial slogan to push forward the idea of resilience in post-disaster interventions, especially with regard to rebuilding houses. This paper examines how and whether the idea is reflected through the government's post-Sidr housing project at Gabtola. It problematizes the slogan from the accounts of community participation, local practicalities, culture, weather and potential future risks. Based on eight months of ethnographic fieldwork at Gabtola, this research found that the basic attributes of the 'build back better' slogan are absent with regard to the housing scheme's cost efficiency, management, livelihoods, public health aspects and tolerance against a super-cyclone. These findings will provide valuable insights into the problems associated with the implementation of post-cyclone public housing programmes in Bangladesh. Such insights can assist public authorities and other relevant organizations and donor agencies in revising and improving their post-disaster housing programmes in the wake of future disasters. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","'Build back better'; Bangladesh; Community participation; Cyclone Sidr; Public housing","Bangladesh; Ziziphus spina-christi; coping strategy; cyclone; government; housing; local participation; public health; resilience; tolerance","","","","","","","Alam E., Collins A.E., Cyclone disaster vulnerability and response experiences in coastal Bangladesh, Disasters, 34, pp. 931-954, (2010); Statistical Yearbook of Bangladesh 2002, (2003); Cook B.R., Lane S.N., Communities of knowledge: Science and flood management in Bangladesh, Environmental Hazards, 9, pp. 8-25, (2010); Coppola D.P., Introduction to International Disaster Management, (2007); Davis I., Shelter after Disaster, (1978); Super Cyclone SIDR 2007: Emergency Response and Action Plans Interim Report, (2007); Super Cyclone SIDR 2007: Impacts and Strategies for Interventions, (2008); Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 2008, (2008); Haque M.M., Relief is full swing, From Crisis to Development: Coping with Disasters in Bangladesh, pp. 27-54, (1992); Islam A.K.M.S., Bala S.K., Hussain M.A., Hossain M.A., Rahman M.M., Performance of coastal structures during Cyclone Sidr, Natural Hazards Review, 12, pp. 111-116, (2011); Islam S., (2012); Johnson C., Strategic planning for post-disaster temporary housing, Disasters, 31, pp. 435-458, (2007); Kabir R., Post-cyclone Sidr Family Shelter Construction in Bangladesh: Documentation of Plans and Processes, (2009); Kelman I., Ashmore J., Leon E., D'urzo S., From research to practice (and vice versa) for post-disaster settlement and shelter, Environmental Hazards, 10, pp. 262-278, (2011); Kennedy J., Ashmore J., Babister E., Kelman I., The meaning of 'build back better': Evidence from post-tsunami aceh and sri lanka, Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management, 16, pp. 24-36, (2008); Mallick F.H., Rahman M.A., Cyclone shelters and alternatives for sustained development in bangladesh, Journal of South Asia Disaster Studies, 1, pp. 59-67, (2008); Mileti D.S., Disaster by Design: A Reassessment of Natural Hazards in the United States, (1999); Muslim Aid, After Cyclone Sidr, (2007); Sidr Survivors Begin to Rebuild Their Lives, (2008); One Year after Cyclone Sidr: Fear Replaces Hope, (2008); Paul B.K., 2004 tsunami relief efforts: An overview, Asian Profile, 35, pp. 467-478, (2007); Paul B.K., Why relatively fewer people died?

Despite early cyclone warnings and evacuation orders for coastal residents, thousands of individuals stayed in their homes. This study examines dissemination of the warning, assesses the warning responses, and explores the reasons why many residents did not evacuate. Field data collected from 257 Sidr survivors in four severely affected coastal districts revealed that more than three-fourths of all respondents were aware of the cyclone warnings and evacuation orders. Despite the sincere efforts of the Bangladesh government, however, lapses in cyclone warnings and evacuation procedures occurred. Field data also revealed several reasons why evacuation orders were not followed. The reasons fell into three broad groups: those involving shelter characteristics; the attributes of the warning message itself; and the respondents' characteristics. Based on our findings, we recommend improved cyclone warnings and utilization of public shelters for similar events in the future. © 2010 by the American Geographical Society of New York.","Coastal Bangladesh; Cyclone Sidr; Cyclone warnings; Evacuation orders; Public shelters","Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster Planning; Disasters; History, 21st Century; Humans; Population Groups; Public Facilities; Public Health; Public Health Practice; Safety; Bangladesh; Ziziphus spina-christi; coastal zone; cyclone; future prospect; hazard assessment; hazard management; shelter; state role; warning system; article; Bangladesh; disaster; disaster planning; economics; education; ethnic and racial groups; ethnology; history; human; hurricane; legal aspect; psychological aspect; public health; public health service; safety; sanitation","","","","","","","Bandura A., Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, (1986); Bern C., Sniezek J., Mathbor G.M., Siddiqi M.S., Ronsmans C., Risk Factors for Mortality in the Bangladesh Cyclone of 1991, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 71, 1, pp. 73-78, (1993); Blanchard D.R., Risk Communication and Individual Response: Impact of 1990 Revised Earthquake Probabilities for the San Francisco Bay Area, (1992); Blanchard-Boehm D.R., Cook M.J., Risk Communication and Public Education in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada on the 10th Anniversary of the "" Black Friday"" Tornado, International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education, 13, 1, pp. 38-54, (2004); Bolin R., Stanford L., Constructing Vulnerability in the First World: The Northridge Earthquake in Southern California, 1994, The Angry Earth: Disaster in Anthropological Perspective, pp. 89-112, (1999); Byron R.K., Donors Propose $4b Plan to Fight Natural Calamities: Daily Star [Dhaka], (2008); Chaiken S., The Heuristic Model of Persuasion, Social Influence: The Ontario Symposium, pp. 3-39, (1987); Chowdhury A.M.R., Bhuyia A.U., Choudhury A.Y., Sen R., The Bangladesh Cyclone of 1991: Why So Many People Died, Disasters, 17, 4, pp. 291-304, (1993); Chowdhury K.M.M.H., Cyclone Preparedness and Management in Bangladesh, Improvement of Early Warning System and Responses in Bangladesh towards Total Disaster Risk Management Approach, pp. 115-119, (2002); CPP at a Glance, (2007); Dolnick S., Cyclone Warning Saved Many Lives: AP Online, (2007); Dow K., Cutter S.L., Public Orders and Personal Opinions: Household Strategies for Hurricane Risk Management, Environmental Hazards, 2, 4, pp. 143-155, (2000); Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh: Damage, Loss and Needs Assessment for Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction, (2008); Haider R., Rahman A.A., Huq S., Cyclone ′91: An Environmental and Perceptional Study, (1991); Haque C.E., Climate Hazards Warning Process in Bangladesh: Experience of, and Lessons from, the 1991 April Cyclone, Environmental Management, 19, 5, pp. 719-734, (1995); Haque C.E., Atmospheric Hazards Preparedness in Bangladesh: A Study of Warning, Adjustments and Recovery from the April 1991 Cyclone, Natural Hazards, 16, 2-3, pp. 181-202, (1997); Haque C.E., Blair D., Vulnerability to Tropical Cyclones: Evidence from the April 1991 Cyclone in Coastal Bangladesh, Disasters, 16, 3, pp. 217-229, (1992); Heath M., UN Grants Aid to Bangladesh to Assist 3 Million Hit by Cyclone: Bloomberg.com, (2007); Helweg-Larsen M., (The Lack of) Optimistic Biases in Response to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake: The Role of Personal Experience, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 21, 2, pp. 119-129, (1999); Hossain M.A., Cyclone Prediction, Forecasting, Warning Systems and Dissemination Methods: Bangladesh Perspective, Improvement of Early Warning System and Responses in Bangladesh towards Total Disaster Risk Management Approach, pp. 141-148, (2002); Ikeda K., Gender Differences in Human Loss and Vulnerability in Natural Disasters: A Case Study from Bangladesh, Indian Journal of Gender Studies, 2, 2, pp. 171-193, (1995); Islam M.A., Tropical Cyclones: Coastal Bangladesh, Natural Hazards: Local, National, Global, pp. 19-25, (1974); Mileti D.S., Disaster by Design: A Reassessment of Natural Hazards in the United States, (1999); Paul A., Rahman M.M., Mahbub A.Q.M., Role of Shelter Center for Cyclone Hazard Mitigation in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, Chittagong University Journal of Science, 26, 1-2, pp. 113-123, (2002); Paul B.K., Why Relatively Fewer People Died?

Although the two surveys were conducted in different time horizons—one about 10 years following the catastrophic event (Gorky) and the other in the immediate aftermath of the event (Sidr)—the cyclone victims cited similar reasons for their lack of evacuation to designated cyclone shelters. Despite recent improvements in cyclone warning systems and a major expansion of public cyclone shelters in coastal Bangladesh, which are clearly reflected in significant increases in formal evacuation, from only 3 per cent of the Gorky respondents to 33 per cent of the Sidr respondents, the lack of adequate numbers of shelters and problems with the cyclone warning systems have been attributed by the respondents as the principal deterrents of evacuation to the designated shelters. Most of the other factors, such as problems with logistics, gender issues, anxiety about the security of possessions left at home, and respondents' perceptions and experience of the cyclone hazards, are consistent with the findings of previous studies on the Gorky event, in particular, and other studies on cyclone/hurricane evacuation, more generally. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Coastal Bangladesh; Cyclone Gorky; Cyclone shelters; Cyclone Sidr; Cyclone warnings; Evacuation initiatives","","","","","","","","Alexander D.A., Natural Disasters, (1993); Amin Z.A., Learning to live with disasters, (2007); Baker E.J., Hurricane evacuation behavior, International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, 9, pp. 287-310, (1991); Blake G., The gathering storm, OnEarth, 30, 2, pp. 22-37, (2008); Blanchard-Boehm R.D., Cook M.J., Risk communication and public education in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada on the 10th anniversary of the ‘Black Friday’ tornado, International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education, 13, 1, pp. 38-54, (2004); Chaiken S., The heuristic model of persuasion, Social Influence: The Ontario Symposium, pp. 3-39, (1987); Chowdhury M.H.K., Cyclone preparedness and management in Bangladesh, Improvement of Early Warning System and Responses in Bangladesh towards Total Disaster Risk Management Approach, pp. 97-106, (2002); Chowdhury A.M.R., Bhuyia A.U., Choudhury A.Y., Sen R., The Bangladesh cyclone of 1991: Why so many people died, Disasters, 7, 4, pp. 291-304, (1993); Cutter S.L., Environmental Risks and Hazards, (1994); CPP at a Glance, (2007); Debnath S., More shelter could save many lives, (2007); Standing Orders on Disaster, (1999); Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh: Damage, Loss and Needs Assessment for Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction, (2008); Haque C.E., Climatic hazards warning process in Bangladesh: Experience of, and lessons from, the 1991 April cyclone, Environmental Management, 19, 5, pp. 719-734, (1995); Haque C.E., Atmospheric hazards preparedness in Bangladesh: A study of warning, adjustments and recovery from the April 1991 cyclone, Natural Hazards, 16, pp. 181-202, (1997); Haque C.E., Blair D., Vulnerability to tropical cyclones: Evidence from the April 1991 cyclone in coastal Bangladesh, Disasters, 16, pp. 217-229, (1992); Heath M., UN grants aid to Bangladesh to assist 3 million hit by cyclone, (2007); Hossain M.A., Cyclone prediction, forecasting, warning systems and dissemination methods: Bangladesh perspective, Improvement of Early Warning System and Responses in Bangladesh towards Total Disaster Risk Management Approach, pp. 141-148, (2002); Hossain M.Z., Islam M.T., Sakai T., Ishida M., Impact of tropical cyclone on rural infrastructures in Bangladesh, Agricultural Engineering International: The CIGR Ejournal, 10, 2, pp. 1-13, (2008); Hyndman D., Hyndman D., Natural Hazards and Disasters, (2006); Ikeda K., Gender differences in human loss and vulnerability in natural disasters: A case study from Bangladesh, Indian Journal of Gender Studies, 2, 2, pp. 171-193, (1995); Islam M.A., Tropical cyclones: Coastal Bangladesh, Natural Hazards: Local, National, Global, pp. 19-30, (1974); Karim N., Options for Cyclone Protection: Bangladesh Context, (2008); Khan M.R., Rahman M.A., Partnership approach to disaster management in Bangladesh: A critical policy assessment, Natural Hazards, 41, pp. 359-378, (2007); Mileti D.S., Natural Hazards Warning Systems in the United States, (1995); Paul B.K., Why relatively fewer people died?

This region is among the world’s most dynamic deltas due to monsoon precipitation that drives tremendous discharge and sediment volumes from the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna drainage basin. Theoretically, it draws on the concept of adaptive cycles that theorizes systems transitioning through phases of growth, conservation, release (collapse), and reorganization, with a focus on the cycle’s release (collapse) phase and coupled linkages between the natural system of shoreline change and social system of household behavior. We use Landsat imagery to produce and describe a thirty-year record of shoreline change for an 80-km stretch of the Lower Meghna estuary. Household survey data characterized population impacts and risk perception for a subregion with high erosion rates. Results identified significant space–time differences and patterns of shoreline change and population impacts consistent with the adaptive cycle. North, central, and south regions exhibited statistically significant differences in space–time patterns of shoreline change. Substantial numbers of households reported displacement due to riverbank erosion and high levels of experience and worry about future displacement. Results demonstrate how geospatial analysis of a multidecade record of shoreline change along with analysis of household survey data can identify regions most vulnerable to riverbank erosion with implications to inform mitigation and adaptation. This work adds empirical demonstration of coupled adaptive cycles to the literature. Limitations and complexities of the adaptive cycle framework are discussed. © 2020 by American Association of Geographers.","adaptive cycle; erosion/accretion; household survey; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis","Bangladesh; Ganges Delta; Meghna River; accretion; bank erosion; coastal morphology; delta; erosion; geomorphological response; hazard assessment; household survey; remote sensing; shoreline change","","","","","","","Ackerman J.T., Climate change, national security, and the Quadrennial Defense Review, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2, 1, pp. 56-96, (2008); Ahmed A., Drake F., Nawaz R., Woulds C., Where is the coastal?

Box 117315, Gainesville, 32611-7315, FL, United States","Identifying the flooding risk hotspot is crucial for aiding a rapid response and prioritizes mitigation efforts over large disaster impacted regions. While climate change is increasing the risk of floods in many vulnerable regions of the world, the commonly used crisis map is inefficient and cannot rapidly determine the spatial variation and intensity of flooding extension across the affected areas. In such cases, the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistic can detect heterogeneity or the flooding hotspot at a local spatial scale beyond routine mapping. This area, however, has not yet been studied in the context of the magnitude of the floods. The present study incorporates the LISA methodology including Moran’s I and Getis-Ord Gi* to identify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the occurrence of flooding from super cyclone Amphan across 16 coastal districts of Bangladesh. Using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, “water” and “land” were classified for the pre-event (16 May 2020) and post-events (22 May, 28 May, and 7 June 2020) of the area under study. A Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and visual comparison were used to evaluate the flood maps. A compelling agreement was accomplished between the observed and predicted flood maps, with an overall precision of above 95% for all SAR classified images. As per this study, 2233 km2 (8%) of the region is estimated to have been inundated on 22 May. After this point, the intensity and aerial expansion of flood decreased to 1490 km2 by 28 May before it increased slightly to 1520 km2 (2.1% of the study area) on 7 June. The results from LISA indicated that the main flooding hotspots were located in the central part, particularly in the region off the north-east of the mangrove forest. A total of 238 Unions (smallest administrative units) were identified as high flooding hotspots (p < 0.05) on 22 May, but the number of flooding hotspots dropped to 166 in the second week (28 May) after Amphan subsided before it increased to a further 208 hotspots (p < 0.05) on 7 June due to incessant rainfall and riverbank failure in the south-west part of the study area. As such, an appropriate, timely, and cost-effective strategy would be to assess existing flooding management policies through the identified flooding hotspot regions. This identification would then allow for the creation of an improved policy to help curtail the destructive effects of flooding in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

The objective of this research was to explore the extent of compliance with the new prescribed or recommended seismic-resistant features in rebuilt residential structures in two Nepal districts that were severely damaged during the earthquake. The primary source of data was a field survey conducted with a structural questionnaire among 332 affected households during October and November 2022. The survey also utilized informal interviews at three study sites in August 2023, with results showing that 95%–97 % of total respondents reconstructed their houses according to earthquake-resistant standards. The same percentage of respondents withdrew the final payment from the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA). Most reconstructed houses were smaller than before the earthquake; many respondents rebuilt one-room, one-story structures. In addition, housing typologies at the study sites changed from brick/stone and mud-based masonry to cement-based construction.

It not only affects people living in inland char areas and along the major braided rivers, but also the coastal areas. Charlands are characterized by both erosion and deposition. When the rate of deposition exceeds the rate of erosion, over time, some chars become attached to the mainland, particularly, in the coastal areas. While coping strategies of displaced people in inland areas have been widely studied, relatively little is known about such strategies for people displaced by riverbank erosion in coastal Bangladesh. This chapter addresses this gap via a questionnaire survey conducted among 413 households in 15 villages of Ramgati Upazila in the Lakshmipur District. The Survey was followed by Focus Group Meetings and Key Informant Interviews. All study villages are located along the eastern bank of the lower Meghna River, around the main outlet of the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna drainage basin. The survey revealed that people of the study area mitigated impacts of riverbank erosion by adopting various coping strategies, some similar to those adopted by erosion affected people of inland areas and others different. Finally, a number of recommendations are made to assist those adversely affected by riverbank erosion in the lower Meghna River estuary in coastal Bangladesh. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bangladesh; Coping strategies; Lower Meghna estuary; Migration; Riverbank erosion","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1660447); National Science Foundation, NSF","1 This research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) grant number 1660447. 2 A district, which includes several Upazilas (sub-districts), is the second largest administrative unit in Bangladesh, with an average population of 2.5 million.

This tornado stands as the deadliest single tornado to hit the United States since modern recordkeeping began in 1950, surpassing the tornado of 8 June 1953 that claimed 116 lives in Flint, Michigan. The record number of deaths caused by the single tornado in Joplin was far higher than the average annual number of US tornado deaths over the last three decades. This study explores the reasons for the high number of fatalities caused by the 2011 Joplin tornado. Questionnaire surveys administered among tornado survivors and informal discussions with emergency management personnel and others suggest that five reasons are associated with the high number of tornado fatalities experienced in Joplin: (1) the sheer magnitude of this event; (2) its path through commercial and densely populated residential areas; (3) the relatively large size of damage area; (4) the physical characteristics of affected homes in Joplin; and (5) the fact that some residents ignored tornado warnings. Several recommendations are offered, the implementation of which should reduce future tornado fatalities not only in Joplin, but elsewhere in the United States. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Compliance with warnings; Housing characteristics; Joplin tornado; Tornado fatalities; Tornado warnings","Flint; Michigan; Missouri; United States; disaster management; implementation process; natural hazard; population decline; tornado; warning system","","","","","University of Colorado Boulder; Natural Hazards Center, University of Colorado Boulder","Acknowledgments The authors would like to acknowledge the grant from the Natural Hazards Center, University of Colorado at Boulder, which supported this research.

The government of Bangladesh has recently established as a goal the reduction of the current infant mortality rate (IMR) of 122 per 1000 live births to 50 by the year 2000. To accomplish this, a clear understanding of the direct causes of infant deaths is essential for successful design and implementation of appropriate medical intervention programs. Most studies done so far in Bangladesh have been concerned with levels, trends, and determinants of the IMR. In view of paucity of such studies, an attempt is made in this paper to examine the medical causes of infant mortality in a rural area of Bangladesh. The causes are also analyzed for neonatal (infant deaths under 28 days of age) and post-neonatal (infant deaths at 28 to 365 days of age) periods. Finally, the policy implications of this study are discussed in some detail. -from Author","","Bangladesh; developing country; fertility impact; health planning; health policy; infant mortality; medical intervention; mortality cause; policy implication; population change; rural area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026273231"

The lifetime chance of maternal death is 1 in 21 in Africa as compared to 1 in 54 in Asia, which ranks second. Using published data, this paper examines the level and correlates of maternal mortality ration (MMR) in Africa. The data indicates that MMR greatly differs among the countries of Africa. High MMR is found in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, while countries of Northern Africa are characterized by relatively low maternal death. Reasons for high MMR in sub-Saharan Africa are explored in detail. Analysis using multiple regression suggest that the MMR in Africa is strongly influenced by population size, crude birth rate (CBR), crude death rate (CDR), calorie supply as a percentage of requirements, access to safe water, and percentage of urban population. Some cultural and behavioral factors, such as female circumcision and infibulation, are also associated with a high MMR. Future programs aimed at reducing the maternal mortality in African countries may benefit from the findings of this study. © 1993.","childbirth; correlates; maternal death; sub-Saharan Africa","Adolescent; Adult; Africa; Birth Rate; Developing Countries; Economics; Energy Intake; Female; Health Services Needs and Demand; Human; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Mortality; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Age; Pregnancy; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Africa; Africa, (sub-Sahara); drinking water; comparative studies; developing region; international comparison; maternal mortality; maternal mortality ratio; mortality rate; multiple regression; population change; women's health; africa; birth rate; caloric intake; circumcision; conference paper; cultural anthropology; epidemiology; female; geographic distribution; human; maternal mortality; mortality; multiple regression; population; risk assessment; urban population; water quality","","","","","","","Boerma, Levels of maternal mortality in developing countries, Studies in Family Planning, 18, pp. 213-221, (1987); Boerma, Mati, Identifying maternal mortality through networking results from coastal Kenya, Studies in Family Planning, 20, pp. 245-253, (1989); Graham, Maternal mortality: levels, trends, and data deficiencies, Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, pp. 101-116, (1991); Koenig, Et al., Maternal mortality in Matlab, Bangladesh: 1976–1985, Stud.

Many Bangladeshis are now suffering from arsenic-related diseases. The objectives of this paper are to examine the extent of delay in seeking medical treatment by victims of arsenic poisoning and to identify factors contributing to this delay. Questionnaire survey successfully administered to 663 victims living in two rural areas of Bangladesh provided the major data source for this study. Analysis of survey data reveal that median delay period was 12 months, but the delay period ranged from 1 month to 18 years. Because of this extremely large range, the mean delay period was about 22 months. The study identified time of identification of symptoms of arsenicosis as the most significant determinant of treatment delay followed by treatment sought from members of mobile medical teams, perceived threat, and level of education. Based on the study findings, it is recommended that the Bangladesh government and NGOs involved in arsenic mitigation and prevention efforts should educate individuals at risk for arsenic poisoning about the benefits of seeking early treatment. This study also recommends to continue to dispatch mobile medical teams to the arsenic-impacted areas. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This issue is analyzed within the pluralist medical milieu and very high infant mortality rates prevalent in Bangladesh. There are several different medical cultures in Bangladesh each with their distinctive ideologies about disease causation and the nature of medical intervention. Practitioners of the modern cosmopolitan or western system of medicine are only one of the major types among several types of healers. The choice of a healer by the parents of infants is a complex process depending on a great variety of conditions such as the health status of the infant, relative proximity of the healer, cost of health care, transportation facilities, gender of the infant, attitude of the parents toward different systems of medicine, the past experience of the parents and the like. We posit that the choice of healer of a particular type may be related less to the traditional or modern orientation of the parents than to the severity of the infant's condition and the expectancy of cure. Thus, infants exhibiting acute symptoms of a disease may be more likely to be placed under the care of a 'western' type physician than taken for treatment to an indigenous medical practitioner. Such attitude on the part of the parents may, however, result in the loss of precious time at the most critical moments, and thus may reduce their chances of success to save their infant's life. The introduction of 'Palli Chikitshok' (village doctor) may have had some impact on the reduction of infant mortality by bringing preventive measures within the reach of village communities. © 1986.","ayurveda; Bangladesh; homeopathy; infant mortality; unani; utilization","Bangladesh; Female; Human; Infant; Infant Mortality; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Referral and Consultation; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; article; Bangladesh; female; human; infant; infant mortality; male; patient referral; rural population; sex difference; socioeconomics; traditional medicine; utilization review","","","","","","","Weisskopf, The frontiers and limits of science, Daedalus, 113, pp. 177-195, (1984); Leslie, Ambiguities of medical revivalism in India, Asian Medical Systems, pp. 356-367, (1976); Bhardwaj, Attitude toward different systems of medicine: a survey of four villages in the Punjab—India, Soc.

This paper explores and analyzes how tornado victims adjusted to this destruction. Data collected from two study sites show that victims received emergency assistance from people both in neighboring areas and from more distant areas, as well as from government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). At both sites, NGOs played the leading role in minimizing the hardships of victims through extraordinary disaster relief and rehabilitation efforts. Because of the extensive support received, the tornado victims were able to return to their “normal” lives very quickly. This study concludes with several recommendations to help cope with future tornado disasters. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Data from detailed interviews with 1,787 women of reproductive ages were collected and analyzed. A multivariate approach was employed to examine the relative importance of different correlates of infant mortality. Birth interval and contraceptive use emerged as the strongest correlates of infant mortality. In addition, landholding size, birth of preferred sex, mother's age, and prior pregnancy loss had significant effects on infant mortality. The analysis suggests that some aspects of childbearing result in higher risks of infant mortality. Infant mortality could be reduced by altering the spacing of births and avoiding births at early reproductive ages. A positive impact on infant mortality could also result from improvements in economic conditions. 1990 Rural Sociological Society","","Bangladesh; birth interval; contraceptive use; developing country;

Somewhere between 35 to 57 million people in the country are now suspected of being affected by drinking water contaminated with arsenic. While the Bangladesh government, non-government organizations (NGOs), and bilateral and multilateral assistance agencies are involved in combating this dreadful problem, all of their efforts to date have proceeded without having grassroots information about arsenic poisoning. The objectives of this study are to investigate the level of knowledge rural residents have regarding arsenic poisoning and to identify the correlates of that knowledge. Questionnaire surveys administered among residents of four rural areas in Bangladesh provided the major data source for this study. Twenty villages were selected from moderate and low arsenic risk regions and a total of 356 respondents, 177 from medium risk regions and 179 from low risk regions, were interviewed. Analysis of the survey data reveals that arsenic awareness is currently not widespread in the study villages, particularly in the low arsenic risk region. There are also gaps in arsenic knowledge regarding the diseases caused by arsenic poisoning and mitigating measures available to prevent contamination. This study identified arsenic risk region, level of education, gender, and age as important determinants of arsenic knowledge. The findings of this study will aid in making existing health education programs more effective and in reducing the risk of developing arsenic-related illnesses. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This literature clearly suggests that victims of natural disasters need outside support to cope with hardships and distress caused by extreme events. This is particularly true for victims in developing countries, where disasters create demands that cannot be met by domestic resources. However, many hazard researchers claim that relief goods that are often sent are not properly distributed and these goods are often not of the appropriate type nor sufficient in quantity. These researchers further claim that emergency aid is counter-productive and it increases dependency on external sources. The objective of this paper is to critically review the provision of disaster relief in developing countries, with special reference to Bangladesh. The primary emphasis of this paper is on changes that have occurred in the area of disaster relief over the last three decades. This paper provides evidence that, because of these changes, relief efforts have become more integrated with development projects and less burdened with the problems outlined in earlier literature critical of the provision of emergency relief to disaster victims. © 2006 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.","Bangladesh; Development; Disaster relief; NGOs; Sources of support; Structural changes","Asia; Bangladesh; Eurasia; South Asia; developing world; development project; disaster relief; natural disaster","","","","","","","Abedin N., Management of rural development in Bangladesh: An overview (1971-present), Asian Profile, 28, pp. 76-82, (2000); Ahluwalia I.J., Hussain Z., Development achievements and challenges, Economic and Political Weekly, 39, pp. 4013-4022, (2004); Alam J., Organizing the rural poor and its impact: The experience of selected non-governmental and governmental organizations in Bangladesh, Economic Bulletin for Asia and the Pacific, 39, pp. 33-42, (1988); Albala-Bertrand J.M., The Political Economy of Large Natural Disasters, with Special Reference to Developing Countries, (1993); Alexander D., Confronting Catastrophe, (2000); Autier P., Ferir M., Hairapetien A., Alexanian A., Agoudjian V., Schmets C., Dallemagne C., Leva M., Pinel J., Drug supply in the aftermath of the 1988 Armenian earthquake, Lancet, 335, pp. 1388-1390, (1990); Barnett B.J., US government natural disaster assistance: Historical analysis and a proposal for the future, Disaster, 23, pp. 139-155, (1999); Bebbington A., NGOs and uneven development: Geographies of development intervention, Progress in Human Geography, 28, pp. 725-745, (2004); Benson C., Twigg J., Myers M., NGO initiatives in risk reduction: An overview, Disasters, 25, pp. 199-215, (2001); Blaikie P., Cannon T., Davis I., Wisner B., At Risk: Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability, and Disasters, (1994); Bolin R., Stanford L., Constructing vulnerability in the First World: The Northridge earthquake in Southern California, The Angry Earth: Disaster in Anthropological Perspective, pp. 89-112, (1999); Brock T.V., Paul B.K., Public response to a tornado disaster: The case of Hoisington, Kansas, Papers of the Applied Geography Conferences, 26, pp. 343-351, (2003); Brown G., Making a tragedy out of a disaster, The World Today, 61, pp. 7-8, (2005); Cowen M., Shenton R., Doctrines of Development, (1996); Cuny F.C., Disasters and Development, (1983); Cutter S., Vulnerability to environmental hazards, Progress in Human Geography, 20, pp. 529-539, (1996); Ninno C., Dorosh P.A., Maintaining food security in the wake of natural disaster: Policy and household response to the 1998 floods in Bangladesh, Journal of Bangladesh Studies, 4, pp. 12-24, (2002); Del Ninno C., Dorosh P.A., Smith L.C., Roy D.K., The 1998 Floods in Bangladesh: Disaster Impacts, Household Coping Strategies, and Response, (2001); Disasters, Collective Behavior and Social Organization, (1994); Elliott C., Some aspects of relations between the North and South in the NGO sector, World Development, 15, pp. 57-68, (1987); El-Masri S., Tipple G., Urbanisation, poverty and natural disasters: Vulnerability of settlements in developing countries, Reconstruction after Disaster, Issues and Practices, pp. 1-12, (1997); Fowler A., Doing it better?

The existing literature widely acknowledges the fact that disaster victims migrate from affected areas. This paper, though, provides empirical evidence of the non-occurrence of out-migration in the after-math of the 14 April 2004 tornado in Bangladesh. Data collected from 291 respondents from eight tornado-affected villages suggest that no one from these locations migrated to other areas. The constant flow of disaster aid and its proper distribution by the government and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were the main reasons why victims did not leave. This study contributes to the disaster literature by providing three important findings: disasters do not always create out-migration; emergency aid can compensate in monetary terms for damage caused by disasters; and some of the arguments made in the literature against the provision of emergency relief for disaster victims are not always valid for all countries. © Overseas Development Institute, 2005.","Disaster aid; Migration; Non-governmental organisations; North-central bangladesh; Tornado","Adult; Bangladesh; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Natural Disasters; Questionnaires; Relief Work; Asia; Bangladesh; Eurasia; South Asia; aid policy; disaster management; nongovernmental organization; tornado; adult; Bangladesh; disaster; female; human; male; middle aged; migration; organization and management; questionnaire; review; statistics","","","","","","","Ahmed S., Rural - Urban migration: Policy simulations in a dual economy model of bangladesh, The Developing Economies, 24, pp. 26-53, (1986); Alexander D., Confronting Catastropha, (2000); Anderson M.B., Understanding the disaster-development continuum, Women and Emergency, pp. 7-10, (1994); Blaikie P.M., Et al., At Risk: Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability, and Disasters, (1994); Brook V.T., Paul B.P., Public response to a Tornado disaster: The case of Hoisington, Kansas, Papers of the Applied Geography Conferences, 26, pp. 343-351, (2003); Cannon T., Vulnerability analysis and the explanation of ""natural"" disasters, Disasters, Development and Environment, pp. 13-30, (1994); Cross J.A., Megacities and small towns: Different perspectives on hazard vulnerability, Environmental Hazards, 3, pp. 63-80, (2001); Dvorak J.A., Wiebe M., StormVictims get incentives, The Kansas City Star, (2003); El-Masri S., Tipple G., Urbanisation, poverty and natural disasters:Vulnerability of settlements in developing countries, Reconstruction after Disaster: Issues and Practices, pp. 1-12, (1997); Fowler A., Doing it better?

The very low contraceptive prevalence rate and the large gap between knowledge and use of contraceptive methods indicates the poor performance of the program. After discussing the probable reasons for such performance, the paper suggests accelarating the demand for contraceptives among the married women of Bangladesh through persuasion and by improving the existing contraceptive distribution system.

After observing widespread corruption and misuse of relief aid by the Bangladesh government in 1974 and subsequent years, external sources began to channellize emergency assistance to the victims through NGOs. Realizing that NGOs were usurping its authority over external disaster assistance, the government looked for opportunities to demonstrate its ability to deliver services to victims. An opportunity came in July 1998 when Bangladesh experienced a devastating flood. Using data collected from 348 households in 11 villages, this paper compares support received by the respondents from the Bangladesh government and NGOs during and immediately after the flood. Respondent opinions regarding emergency relief distribution suggest that both sources performed satisfactorily and an overwhelming majority of them thought that the government performed better than it had previously in distributing relief assistance to flood victims. Following an analysis of the survey data, this paper discusses the policy implications for future disaster assistance efforts in Bangladesh and elsewhere.","Bangladesh; Disaster victims; Emergency assistance; Flood; Government; NGOs","Bangladesh; disaster management; disaster relief; flood; nongovernmental organization; state role","","","","","","","Abedin N., Management of rural development in Bangladesh: An overview (1971-present), Asian Profile, 28, pp. 76-82, (2000); Annual Report, 1996, (1996); Alam J., Organizing the rural poor and its impact: The experience of selected non-governmental and governmental organizations in Bangladesh, Economic Bulletin for Asia and the Pacific, 39, pp. 33-42, (1988); Alam N.S.M., Social Science Literatue on Natural Disaster in Bangladesh: A Source Book, (1994); Alexander D., Confronting Catastrophe, (2000); Armstrong A., Reporting of drought in Bangladesh: A study of LWS/RDRS-ODA drought response project, Asian Affairs, 17, pp. 82-87, (1995); Bacos D., O'Donnell M., Disaster Response to the Bangladesh Floods of 1998, (1999); Bangladesh Population Census 1991: Union Statistics, (1993); The Bangladesh Census of Agriculture 1996, (1996); 1998 Statistical Yearbook of Bangladesh, (1999); Blaikie P., Cannon T., Davis I., Wisner B., at Risk: Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability, and Disasters, (1994); Booth D., Rethinking Social Development: Theory Research and Practice, (1994); Choudury M., Report on the Bangladesh Flood 1998, (1998); Chowdhury M.R., An assessment of flood forecasting in Bangladesh: The experience of the 1998 flood, Natural Hazards, 22, pp. 139-163, (2000); Colclough C., Manor J., States or Markets?

The results of this study suggest that attitude toward contraception in general, global motivation, and method-specific attitude were the three important determinants of the intention to use birth control pills in the study area.

Accepting the 1998 SOFA would have allowed entry of U.S. troops in Bangladesh without passports or visas and without requiring declaration of military hardware. This would have facilitated American forces support for relief operations and rehabilitation of disaster victims in the shortest possible time. Unfortunately, the Bangladesh government rejected the U.S. terms outlined in the 1998 proposal. A sample survey was conducted among Bangladeshi Americans to examine their opinions regarding the 1998 SOFA. Survey data reveals that slightly over 58 percent of the respondents supported signing the SOFA. Reasons for their support or opposition to the U.S. proposal are also presented. Statistical analyses suggest that whether respondents have studied or are currently studying in the United States emerged as the most significant factor associated with approval or disapproval of the 1998 SOFA.

The communities of Arkansas City and Augusta were among those most severely affected by these floods. This study is based primarily on a mail questionnaire survey of residents of these two communities, and it examines respondents' satisfaction with four emergency response measures employed by local officials and emergency management agencies before and during the flood event. The extent of external support victims received and the level of their satisfaction with that support were also investigated. The analysis of the survey data shows that the emergency response efforts and the support victims received were rated poorly. Furthermore, the satisfaction scores differed significantly between respondents from Arkansas City and those from Augusta. The findings suggest that the extent of damage and preparedness are directly associated with victims' satisfaction with emergency measures undertaken by emergency management agencies. The study further suggests that the respondents of Arkansas City were relatively more satisfied with emergency measures than their counterparts in Augusta. Unlike in Arkansas City, city officials in Augusta had little time to prepare for the flooding. Hazard preparedness appears to be an important determinant of victims' satisfaction with emergency measures.","Emergency measures; External support; Flash flood evacuation; Flash flood warning; Flash flood watch; Floods; Kansas","United States; disaster management; disaster relief; flood control; hazard management; questionnaire survey","","","","","","","Arkansas City Traveler, (1998); Blaikie P., Cannon T., Davis I., Wisner B., At Risk: Natural Hazards, People's Vulnerability, and Disasters, (1994); Bolin R., Stanford L., The Northridge Earthquake: Community-based approaches to unmet recovery needs, Disasters, 22, 1, pp. 21-38, (1998); Bryant E., Natural Hazards, (1991); Burton I., Kates R.W., White G.F., The Environment as Hazard, (1978); Residential Damage Valuation, (1998); Damage Assessment Summary, (1998); Dow K., Burns P., Cutter S.L., To stay or leave: Residents' evaluation of hurricane evacuation warnings, Papers and Proceedings of the Applied Geography Conferences, 22, pp. 107-114, (1999); Driever L.S., Vaughn D.M., Flood hazard in Kansas City since 1880, The Geographical Review, 78, 1, pp. 14-24, (1988); Dymon U.T., QR 114: Effectiveness of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Applications in Flood Management During and After Hurricane Fran, (1999); Ericksen N.J., A tale of two cities: Flood history and the prophetic past of Rapid City, South Dakota, Economic Geography, 54, 4, pp. 305-320, (1975); Gruntfest E.C., What People Did During the Big Thompson Flood, (1977); Gruntfest E.C., What We Have Learned Since the Big Thompson Flood, (1986); Gruntfest E.C., Warning, dissemination and response with short lead times, Flood Hazard Management: British and International Perspectives, (1987); Haas J.E., Kates R.W., Bowden M.J., Reconstruction Following Disaster, (1977); Kansas State Collegian, (1998); Krzysztofowicz R., Davis D., Towards improving flood forecasting-response systems, Violent Forces of Nature, pp. 169-189, (1986); Manhattan Mercury, (1998); Manhattan Mercury, (1999); Mileti D.S., Disasters by Design, (1999); Mileti D.S., Sorensen J., O'Brien P.W., Toward an explanation of mass care shelter use, Disasters, 10, pp. 25-42, (1992); Mileti D.S., Sorensen J.S., Communication of Emergency Public Warnings: A Social Science Perspective and State-of-Art Assessment, (1990); Montz B.E., Gruntfest E.C., Changes in American urban flood-plain occupancy since 1958: The experience of nine cities, Applied Geography, 6, 4, pp. 325-338, (1986); Flash Floods and Floods: The Awesome Power!

This results in a high incidence of maternal and infant mortality that could be reduced if childbirth were to occur in health centers or under the supervision of trained TBAs (TTBAs). In this paper, we examined factors associated with utilization of modern health resources for childbirth in 39 villages of Bangladesh. We followed a retrospective survey research design to collect relevant information from couples who experienced childbirth during a two-year period from July 1, 1995 to June 1997. The data indicate that slightly over 11% of the deliveries were performed by trained personnel with the rest attended by TBAs. Multivariate analysis clearly shows that delivery complications was the most significant factor determining the use of modern health care resources for childbirth, followed by parental education, and pre-natal care. We conclude that quick response to delivery complications and improved access to hospitals and TTBAs can reduce the risk of infant and maternal mortality and morbidity in rural Bangladesh. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The amended Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 resulted in a steady flow of professional Asian Indians to the United States. While receiving indirect attention in several studies, relatively little is known about the labour-market participation of Asian Indian immigrant women. This research aims to determine the economic and non-economic factors that influence the participation of Asian Indian immigrant women in the labour market of the Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area. On the basis of 160 responses from a questionnaire survey, this research found that annual income, years in current job, occupation type, and the nature of investment in India were the pertinent economic factors, while non-economic factors range from age, urban residential background, education, number of years in the US, the decision to work, and some perceptions on work, homemaking and household income contribution. Findings from this study are discussed in the context of existing theories on international migration, particularly those dealing with the labourforce participation of immigrants. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Asian Indian immigrant women; Economic and non-economic factors; Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area; Labour force; Labour market; Non-participants; Participants","United States; ethnicity; gender disparity; immigrant population; labor participation; racial disparity; urban economy","","","","","","","Amott T., Mathaei J., Race, Gender and Work: A Multicultural Economic History of Women in the United States, (1991); Beneria L., Feldman S., Unequal Burden: Economic Crisis, Persistent Poverty and Women's Work, (1992); Blau F., Women's economic well-being, 1970-1995: Indicators and trends, Focus, 20, pp. 4-10, (1999); Chiswick B., Immigrant earnings pattern by sex, race and ethnic groupings, Monthly Labor Review, pp. 22-25, (1980); Cobb-Clark D., Immigrant selectivity and wages: The evidence for women, American Economic Review, 83, pp. 986-993, (1993); De Angelo D., What About Kansas City!

As poverty increases, women in poor families seek to work to support families. This trend has resulted in expansion of female activity space, after many years of stability. This article analyzes female space in the context of purdah, the patriarchal family structure, and the spatial organization of rural settlements. It discusses ethnic and other differentials that influence female space. Governmental and nongovernmental organizations are urged to create additional employment opportunities for rural women, so as to expand further their activity space. -Author","","Bangladesh; activity space; developing country; employment opportunities; employment opportunity; family structure; female mobility; female space; purdah; rural area; women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00167428","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027038798"

The river floods are normal annual events and human settlements and agricultural practices have adapted admirably well to their regimes. Abnormal floods that occur once in every few years cause serious damage to crops and properties. To minimize flood losses, a number of modern engineering projects have been constructed within Bangladesh. However, the successful solution of the problem would probably require some international collaboration for basinwide unified systems planning, since large parts of the drainage basins of Bangladesh lie beyond its borders. In the absence of such collaboration, internal resources should be utilized for the construction of smaller public projects, such as polders, and for encouraging and reinforcing various types of indigenous adjustments to floods. There are very few successful indigenous adjustments to coastal floods. Most of the structural solutions, such as community shelters and higher embankments, are expensive public projects that are probably beyond the means of the internal resources of the country. © 1987 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Abnormal floods; Coastal floods; Engineering flood control; Floodplains; Indigenous adjustments; International drainage basins; Normal floods","","","","","","","","Abbas B.M., Utilization and development of the deltaic area of East Pakistan.

The FAP proposed construction of embankments on both sides of all major rivers. There is, however, strong opposition in the country to the ""structural solution"" to its flood problems. The objectives of this paper are to study the farmers' level of awareness, responses to, and the possible positive and negative impacts of the proposed embankment projects as outlined in the FAP. The data for this study were derived from field surveys conducted in two rural areas of Bangladesh. The survey data showed that slightly less than half of the total respondents had heard about the proposed construction of the embankment. The data further showed that the respondents overwhelmingly supported the embankment projects of the FAP. They were also aware of both positive and negative impacts of embankment construction. © 1995.","","Bangladesh; developing country; embankment project; farmers' attitudes; farmers' response; Flood Action Plan; flood control; river embankment","","","","","United Nations Development Program; United States Agency for International Development","Soon after the 1988 flood, four reports were commissioned by the French and Japanese governments, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (Boyce, 1990, p. 425).

The main objective of this study is to examine the means by which residents of a drought-affected area of Bangladesh cope with this hazard. Data were collected during the summer of 1995 from 301 drought-affected households located in northwestern Bangladesh. Analysis suggests that respondent households practised an array of adjustments to mitigate adverse effects of the 1994/5 drought. While both high- and low-income households were affected by the drought, households belonging to the lower socioeconomic group suffered the most, receiving the least support from the national government. Government responses were delayed and inadequate in providing financial and other assistance to the drought victims. It is suggested that the government should be prepared for drought long before the occurrence of such an event.","Adjustments; Coping strategies; Drought impact; Drought response; Sources of support","Bangladesh; coping strategy; drought; humanitarian aid","","","","","Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center","This research was supported by the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center (NHRAIC) at the University of Colorado at Boulder, CO, USA.

The latter would enable geographers of developing countries to update their lectures with the new developments in the discipline. Geographers and geography students of developed countries should explore the possibilities of obtaining funding to visit, conduct research, or spend sabbaticals in developing countries. The Fulbright Scholar Program and other organizations, e.g., the Rockefeller Foundation, provide financial support for US. geography students to conduct Ph.D. research in developing countries. Geography departments in developing countries can provide a base for foreign students conducting this field research. Similar opportunities exist for the geography faculty of one world to teach or conduct field research in the other world. The Fulbright Teacher Exchange Program and Indo-US. Subcommission on Education and Culture Award are some of the organizations active in exchanging and training scholars of both worlds. The Fulbright Scholars in Residence Program, which supports foreign faculty in US. universities for a semester or an academic year, can contribute to the international perspective in U.S. geography departments. While these scholars are in the United States, they can also receive funding to give guest lectures at American universities (see McKim 1989, 19), further expanding their influence. The United Nation’s Transfer of Knowledge Through Expatriate Nationals (TOK-TEN) program can play an important role in exchanging geographic knowledge between the two worlds. The program provides an opportunity for Third World professionals currently working in the First World to return to their home countries for a limited time and share their knowledge and experience with local counterparts. This program is reported to be successful in many developing countries (Logan 1990,223). A formal collaboration program between geography departments of developed and developing countries should also be encouraged. The British Council initiated one such program between the Department of Geography at the University of Zambia and the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Stirling, U.K. (see Akhtar 1988, 102). The main purpose of the program was to strengthen the physical geography and natural resources programs of the University of Zambia. Greater interaction can also be possible by establishing sister departments between uni- versities in Western and Third World countries. Through this program, “staff exchanges might be arranged; students might move in both directions for training and field experience; information and materials might be shared; and each partner would be shaped by a sustained pattern of interaction in some depth” (Wilbanks 1993,2). Conferences and study tours also can bring together professional geographers of different worlds. The AAG Committee on International Research and Exchanges, for example, provided financial support for geographers from less affluent countries to attend the 1992 IGC Congress in Washington, D.C. The AAG should initiate a similar support program for overseas geographers so that some can attend the AAG annual meeting.

The hypothesis is that the likelihood of contraceptive adoption is a function of accessibility to two different types of family planning service outlets (i.e. distance from these outlets has an impact on the use of contraception by married women of reproductive age, 15-49 yr). But the field data do not show a distance decay effect between availability and use of both clinical and non-clinical contraceptive methods. The observed effect is explained in terms of the presence of paved roads in the study area. The policy implications of this finding are discussed. © 1991.","","Bangladesh; contraceptive availability; contraceptive use; developing country; distance decay effect; empirical studies; family planning; family planning availability; fertility impact; policy implication; population characteristics; rural area; transport and communications","","","","","","","Ahmed, Determinants of contraceptive use in rural Bangladesh: the demand for children, supply of children, and costs of fertility regulation, Demography, 24, 3, pp. 361-373, (1987); Aircy, The impact of road construction on hospital in-patient catchments in the Meru district in Kenya, Soc.

In order to prevent cyclonic or storm-surge flooding and to increase crop production by preventing intrusion of saline ocean water, many coastal embankment projects were initiated in the 1960s by the Bangladesh government. After construction of these embankments, particularly their reconstruction in 1991 has increased the frequency of flash floods in coastal areas. The objective of this study is to examine to what extent the reconstruction of embankment is responsible for the increased severity of flash flooding at the Chokoria thana of the Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh. Using hydrological data and perception of the respondents on the increased flooding through the rapid rural appraisal (RRA) method, it was found that severity of the flood increased after the reconstruction of embankments in 1991. Other causes of increased flooding is also explored. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
