To meet these preferences, Medicaid invited states to apply for the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), a program intended to “rebalance” Medicaid-financed long-term services and supports to Home- and Community-Based Services (HCBS). However, only about half of eligible states applied. We interviewed Medicaid administrators to explore why some states applied for BIP whereas others did not. Supportive state leadership and the presence of other programs supporting community-based care were positively related to BIP application. Opposing policy priorities and programs competing for similar resources were negatively related to BIP application. Because states most likely to apply already had policy goals and programs supporting HCBS, BIP may inadvertently widen disparities across states, pushing those on the margins ahead and leaving the ones that are worst off in HCBS support to fall even further behind. © The Author(s) 2020.","balancing incentive program; home- and community-based care and services; long-term services and supports; Medicaid; policy","Aged; Aging; Community Health Services; Home Care Services; Humans; Long-Term Care; Medicaid; Social Welfare; United States; administrative personnel; aged; article; human; independent living; leadership; long term care; medicaid; aging; community care; home care; long term care; social welfare; United States","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (R01MD010360)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Institute of Health under Grant R01MD010360 (PI: R.A.S.).

Method: Interviews with 4,024 community-dwelling older adults with ADL/IADL/mobility disabilities from the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). Reports of socio-demographics, disability compensatory strategies, and adverse consequences of unmet needs in the past month were obtained from older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), probable dementia (DEM), and/or near end-of-life (EOL) and compared older adults not meeting these criteria. Results: Older adults with MCC (31.6%), DEM (39.6%), and EOL (48.7%) reported significantly more adverse consequences than low-need older adults (21.4%). Persons with MCC and DEM (53.4%), MCC, and EOL (53.2%), and all three (MCC, DEM, EOL, 65.6%) reported the highest levels of adverse consequences. HNHC participants reported more environmental modifications, assistive device, and larger helper networks. HNHC status independently predicted greater adverse consequences after controlling for disability compensatory strategies in multivariate models. Discussion: Adverse consequences of unmet needs for care are prevalent among HNHC older adults, especially those with multiple indicators, despite more disability-related compensatory efforts and larger helper networks. Helping caregivers provide better informal care has potential to contain healthcare costs by reducing hospitalization and unplanned readmissions. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Identifying the caregivers in greatest need of support requires an understanding of the current social support networks available to family caregivers and whether specific groups of caregivers are at risk of having an insufficient support network. Research Design and Methods: We collected personal network data from a nationally representative sample of 66 family caregivers to persons with dementia (PWDs) in the United States aged 18 and older, including information on network members' support to the caregiver and help to the care recipient. Results: We found four common caregiving network types: large networks with many helpers; large networks primarily supporting caregivers; small, dense networks supporting both caregivers and care recipient; and small networks providing little help to either caregiver or care recipient. Gender, income, and geographic proximity of caregiver to the care recipient were significantly associated with caregiver network type. Discussion and Implications: This study suggests that there are different types of care and support networks available to caregivers to PWDs, and that the size and structure of networks vary considerably among demographic groups. As the population ages, a better understanding of the supports available to caregivers will be crucial for ensuring that caregivers are adequately supported, and caregiving needs of families are met. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Design: Descriptive longitudinal study with 5-year mortality follow-up among older adults with disability. Baseline in person and telephone interviews/assessments of older adults with disability and their family caregivers carried out in 2011. Setting: Representative samples of older US population and their family caregivers. Participants: US representative samples of older adults with disability aged 65 and over (National Health and Aging Study) and their family caregivers (National Study of Caregiving; www.nhats.org; N = 1,262). Measurement: Controlling for known risk factors for mortality in older adults, including age, gender, race, education, socioeconomic status, disability, and cognitive status, we assess the role of three caregiving factors (depression, anxiety, and burden) and three mediating factors (care recipient depression, anxiety, and unmet needs for care) as predictors of care recipient mortality. Results: Caregiver burden, care recipient depression, and care recipient unmet needs are independent predictors of care recipient mortality. Conclusion: Caregiving factors may play an important role in the survival of their care recipients. This is a relatively unexplored research area that calls for fine-grained studies capturing caregiver—care recipient health-related interactions over time. © 2020 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","care recipient mortality;

These services could potentially substitute for care typically provided by family members, replacing or reducing care from kin. Leveraging one of the most recent Medicaid rebalancing programs, the Balancing Incentive Program (BIP), and using data from the 2008-2016 Health and Retirement Study on 953 Medicaid beneficiaries ages 65 and over with at least one functional limitation, we examined the relationship between exposure to BIP and family and professional caregiving. BIP exposure was not associated with receipt of care or total hours of care. It was, however, associated with more hours of professional care and fewer hours of family care from non-spouse kin. These findings suggest that recent Medicaid rebalancing programs, while intended to meet the desires of older adults, could have implications for their families. © The Author(s) 2024.","family caregiving; long-term care; medicaid","","","","","","University of Michigan, U-M; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (U01AG009740); National Institutes of Health National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities, (R01MD010360)","Funding text 1: Health and Retirement Study, 2008-2016 HRS Core (restricted) dataset.

Few studies examine the pandemic's negative impact on the availability of social networks of caregivers. This article uses data collected during COVID-19 before vaccination to examine caregivers' reports of perceived lost and reduced network support. We assessed the personal networks of a nationally representative sample of 2214 community caregivers in the United States. We analyzed associations between caregiving factors and caregivers' perceptions of lost and reduced network support. Changes in care recipient living circumstances during COVID-19, longer-term caregiving, care recipient hearing/vision/mobility problems, caregiver travel/socializing restrictions, caregiver race/ethnicity, caregiver income, caregiver age, network connectivity, family relationships, and network members' age were associated with perceived lost/reduced support during the pandemic. Findings provide insights for the development of social network interventions to support caregivers and help them cultivate support networks resilient to public health crises. © 2024 RAND Corporation and The Authors.

Method: A systematized review of the literature.

Our synthesis suggests that caregivers miss a significant amount of work and have reductions in productivity due to their caregiving responsibilities.

Discussion: Examining the effect of caregiving on work performance is critical to better understand the full impact of caregiving, especially as demand for caregivers increases as the population ages.

Simulation models can assist in setting policy that anticipates public health needs by predicting the demand for and availability of care. Objective: We developed a relatively simple method for simulating the onset of dementia that can be used in combination with an existing microsimulation model. Methods: We started with Socsim, a demographic microsimulation model that simulates a population with family kinship networks. We simulated dementia in the Socsim population by simulating the number of individuals diagnosed with dementia in their lifetime and the ages of onset and death from dementia for each of these dementia cases. We then matched dementia cases to the simulated population based on age at death, so for each individual, we simulate whether they develop dementia and, if so, their age at onset. This approach simulates dementia onset but does not alter the demographic model’s simulated age of death. Results: We selected model dementia parameters so that the combined Socsim-Dementia model reproduces published dementia prevalence rates and survival times after diagnosis. Conclusions: Adding simulation of dementia to a kinship network model enables prediction of the availability of family caregivers for people with dementia under a range of different assumptions about future fertility, mortality, and dementia risk. We demonstrated how to add simulation of dementia onset and death to an existing microsimulation model to obtain a method for predicting dementia prevalence in the context of another more detailed model. The approach we developed can be generalized to simulate other progressive health conditions that affect mortality. © The Author(s) 2021.","demographic microsimulation; kinship models","Caregivers; Dementia; Family; Health Services; Humans; Prevalence; caregiver; dementia; family; health service; human; prevalence","","","","","University of Berkeley; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R21AG055815); National Institute on Aging, NIA","Funding text 1: We thank Ashton Verdery for generously assisting in the use of the Socsim model, which included providing the data and Socsim code used for simulations.

However, research has neglected to assess whether these shifts have improved access to HCBS for persons with dementia. This paper identifies HCBS access barriers and facilitators, and discusses how barriers contribute to disparities for persons with dementia living in rural areas and exacerbate disparities for minoritized populations. Methods: We analyzed qualitative data from 35 in-depth interviews. Interviews were held with stakeholders in the HCBS ecosystem, including Medicaid administrators, advocates for persons with dementia and caregivers, and HCBS providers. Results: Barriers to HCBS access for persons with dementia range from community and infrastructure barriers (e.g., clinicians and cultural differences), to interpersonal and individual-level barriers (e.g., caregivers, awareness, and attitudes). These barriers affect the health and quality of life for persons with dementia and may affect whether individuals can remain in their home or community. Facilitators included a range of more comprehensive and dementia-attuned practices and services in health care, technology, recognition and support for family caregivers, and culturally competent and linguistically accessible education and services. Discussion: System refinements, such as incentivizing cognitive screening, can improve detection and increase access to HCBS. Disparities in HCBS access experienced by minoritized persons with dementia may be addressed through culturally competent awareness campaigns and policies that recognize the necessity of familial caregivers in supporting persons with dementia. These findings can inform efforts to ensure more equitable access to HCBS, improve dementia competence, and reduce disparities. © The Author(s) 2023.

The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis has been postulated to play the primary biological role in translating chronic stress into ill health. Stressful stimuli activate the HPA-axis and cause an increase in circulating levels of cortisol. Frequent and long-lasting activation of the HPA-axis, as occurs in recurrently stressful environments, can in the long run compromise HPA-axis functioning and ultimately affect health. Negative social interactions with family and friends may be a significant source of stress in daily life, constituting the type of recurrently stressful environment that could lead to compromised HPA functioning and altered diurnal cortisol rhythms. We use data from two waves (1995 and 2004-2005) of the Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) study and from the National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE) and piecewise growth curve models to investigate relationships between histories of social strain and patterns of diurnal cortisol rhythms. We find that reported levels of social strain were significantly associated with their diurnal cortisol rhythm. These effects were more pronounced for individuals with a history of greater reported strain across a ten-year period. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biological markers; Cortisol; Diurnal rhythm; Family; Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS); Social relationships; Social strain; Stress; U.S.A.","Adult; Aged; Conflict (Psychology); Family Conflict; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Interpersonal Relations; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Saliva; Social Environment; Stress, Psychological; United States; United States; hydrocortisone; biomarker; cardiovascular disease; diurnal activity; family structure; health impact; social behavior; adult; aged; article; circadian rhythm; female; hormonal regulation; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; male; personal experience; social interaction; social stress; United States","","hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; Hydrocortisone, 50-23-7","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG020166); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF; John D. and Catherine T.

However, the diffusion and utilization of HCBS may be inequitable across rural and urban residents. We sought to identify potential disparities in rural HCBS access and utilization, and to elucidate factors associated with these disparities. Design: We used qualitative interviews with key informants to explore and identify potential disparities and their associated supply-side factors. Setting and participants: We interviewed 3 groups of health care stakeholders (Medicaid administrators, service agency managers and staff, and patient advocates) from 14 states (n = 40). Measures: Interviews were conducted using a semistructured interview guide, and data were thematically coded using a standardized codebook. Results: Stakeholders identified supply-side factors inhibiting rural HCBS access, including limited availability of LTSS providers, inadequate transportation services, telecommunications barriers, threats to business viability, and challenges to caregiving workforce recruitment and retention. Stakeholders perceived that rural persons have a greater reliance on informal caregiving supports, either as a cultural preference or as compensation for the dearth of HCBS. Conclusions/implications: LTSS rebalancing efforts that limit the institutional LTSS safety net may have unintended consequences in rural contexts if they do not account for supply-side barriers to HCBS. We identified supply-side factors that (1) inhibit beneficiaries’ access to HCBS, (2) affect the adequacy and continuity of HCBS, and (3) potentially impact long-term business viability for HCBS providers. Spatial isolation of beneficiaries may contribute to a perceived lack of demand and reduce chances of funding for new services. Addressing these problems requires stakeholder collaboration and comprehensive policy approaches with attention to rural infrastructure. © 2019 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","health care access;

We investigate the association between early-life adversity and the dynamic range of adult diurnal cortisol secretion. Method In 35-to 86-year-old adults, cortisol assayed from 16 saliva samples over 4 consecutive days was used to compute diurnal dynamic range and area under the curve (AUC). Economic adversity in childhood was indexed by recalled parental education, family welfare dependence, and perceived financial status; and childhood social adversity by parental separation, death, and abuse. Results Adjusted for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, both childhood adversities were strongly associated with smaller adult cortisol diurnal dynamic range, but not with AUC. The association with cortisol dynamic range was explained by adult social and economic variables. Discussion Early-life adversity appears to leave a long-term imprint on cortisol secretion dynamics, reducing diurnal dynamic range without increasing total secretion. This points to the importance of examining the adaptation capacity of physiological systems when studying the impact of early-life and chronic stresses on adult health. © 2017 The Author(s).","Childhood adversity; Cortisol evening nadir; Cortisol morning peak; Dynamic range; Stress response","Adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; United States; hydrocortisone; adult; aged; circadian rhythm; epidemiology; female; human; longitudinal study; male; mental stress; metabolism; middle aged; physiology; saliva; United States; very elderly","","hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; Hydrocortisone, ","","","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, FNIH, (M01-RR00865, P01-AG020166, P30-AG017265, P30-AG028748, R01-AG019239, R01-AG020166, R01-AG033067, U24-AG047867); Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, FNIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (U19AG051426); National Institute on Aging, NIA; John D. and Catherine T.

Objective: We examine the role of caregivers in existing systems of care, identify needed changes in structures and processes, and describe how these changes might be monitored and assessed and who should be accountable for implementing them. Design: Based on a broad assessment of the caregiving literature, the recent National Academy of Sciences Report on family caregiving, and descriptive data from two national surveys, we describe structural and process barriers that limit caregivers' ability to provide effective care. Subjects: To describe the unique challenges and impacts of caring for seriously ill patients, we report data from a nationally representative sample of older adults and their caregivers (National Health and Aging Trends Study [NHATS]; National Study of Caregiving [NSOC]) to identify the prevalence and impact on family caregivers of seriously ill patients who have high needs for support and are high cost to the healthcare system. Measurements: Standardized measures of patient status and caregiver roles and impacts are used. Results: Multiple structural and process barriers limit the ability of caregivers to provide effective care. These issues are exacerbated for the more than 13 million caregivers who provide care and support to 9 million seriously ill older adults. Conclusions: Fundamental changes are needed in the way we identify, assess, and support caregivers.

Methods:We analyzed data on 1180 respondents from the biomarker subsample of the second wave of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. ELA assessments were based on childhood socioeconomic disadvantage (i.e., on welfare, perceived low income, and less educated parents) and other stressors (e.g., parental death, parental divorce, and parental physical abuse). The outcome variable was cumulative allostatic load (AL), a marker of biological risk.We also incorporate information on adult circumstances, including than following: education, social relationships, and health behaviors. Results: Childhood socioeconomic adversity and physical abuse were associated with increased AL (B = 0.094, standard error = 0.041, and B = 0.263, standard error = 0.091 respectively), with nonsignificant associations for parental divorce and death with AL. Adult education mediated the relationship between socioeconomic ELA and cumulative AL to the point of nonsignificance, with this factor alone explaining nearly 40% of the relationship. The association between childhood physical abuse and AL remained even after adjusting for adult educational attainments, social relationships, and health behaviors. These associations were most pronounced for secondary stress systems, including inflammation, cardiovascular function, and lipid metabolism. Conclusions: The physiological consequences of early life socioeconomic adversity are attenuated by achieving high levels of schooling later on. The adverse consequences of childhood physical abuse, on the other hand, persist in multivariableadjusted analysis. © 2015 by the American Psychosomatic Society.","allostatic load; biological risk factor; early life adversity; life course","Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Allostasis; Female; Health Status; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Aged; Poverty; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; biological marker; adult; adult education; Article; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular inflammation; controlled study; death; early life adversity; educational status; female; health behavior; health hazard; human; lipid metabolism; lowest income group; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; outcome variable; parental deprivation; physical abuse; physical activity; priority journal; social interaction; socioeconomics; United States; allostasis; child abuse survivor; health status; life event; poverty; risk factor; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data","","","","","National Institute on Aging, (K01-AG028582, P01-AG020166, R01-AG019239, R01-AG033067, R01-AG19239); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG033067)","","Danesh J., Association of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, albumin, or leukocyte count with coronary heart disease: Metaanalyses of prospective studies, JAMA, 279, pp. 1477-1482, (1998); Dong M., Anda R.F., Felitti V.J., Dube S.R., Williamson D.F., Thompson T.J., Loo C.M., Giles W.H., The interrelatedness of multiple forms of childhood abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction, Child Abuse Negl, 28, pp. 771-784, (2004); Dong M., Giles W.H., Felitti V.J., Dube S.R., Williams J.E., Chapman D.P., Anda R.F., Coronary heart disease-insights into causal pathways for ischemic heart disease: Adverse Childhood Experiences study, Circulation, pp. 245-266, (2004); Felitti V.J., Anda R.F., Nordenberg D., Williamson D.F., Spitz A.M., Edwards V., Koss M.P., Marks J.S., Relationship of childhood abuse and household dysfunction to many of the leading causes of death in adults: The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study, Am J Prev Med, 14, pp. 245-258, (1998); Fuller-Thomson E., Brennenstuhl S., Making a link between childhood physical abuse and cancer, Cancer, 115, pp. 3341-3350, (2009); Fuller-Thomson E., Brennenstuhl S., Frank J., The association between childhood physical abuse and heart disease in adulthood: Findings from a representative community sample, Child Abuse Negl, 34, pp. 689-698, (2010); Gruenewald T.L., Karlamangla A.S., Hu P., Stein-Merkin S., Crandall C., Koretz B., Seeman T.E., History of socioeconomic disadvantage and allostatic load in later life, Soc Sci Med, 74, pp. 75-83, (2012); Hayward M., Gorman B., The long armof childhood: The influence of early-life social conditions on men's mortality, Demography, 41, pp. 87-107, (2004); Montez J.K., Hayward M.D., Early life conditions and later life mortality, International Handbook of Adult Mortality, pp. 187-206, (2011); O'Rand A.M., Hamil-Luker J., Processes of cumulative adversity: Childhood disadvantage and increased risk of heart attack across the life course, J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci, 60 B, pp. 117-124, (2005); Schafer M.H., Ferraro K.F., Childhood misfortune as a threat to successful aging: Avoiding disease, Gerontologist, 52, pp. 111-120, (2012); Shonkoff J.P., Boyce W.T., McEwen B.C., Neuroscience, molecular biology, and the childhood roots of health disparities: Building a new framework for health promotion and disease prevention, JAMA, 301, pp. 2252-2259, (2009); Slopen N., Kubzansky L.D., McLaughlin K.A., Koenen K.C., Childhood adversity and inflammatory processes in youth: A prospective study, Psychoneuroendocrinology, 38, pp. 188-200, (2013); Slopen N., Lewis T.T., Gruenewald T.L., Mujahid M.S., Ryff C.D., Albert M.A., Williams D.R., Early life adversity and inflammation in African Americans and whites in the Midlife in the United States Survey, Psychosom Med, 72, pp. 694-701, (2010); Taylor S.E., Way B.M., Seeman T.E., Early adversity and adult health outcomes, Dev Psychopathol, 23, pp. 939-954, (2011); White H.R., Widom C.S., Does childhood victimization increase the risk of early death?

However, measurement of an individual's usual cortisol rhythm is hampered by the effects of acute stressors, by differences between working days and weekends, by between-day variation in waking time and sleep duration, by variability in cortisol sampling times, and by possible variability in the timing of cortisol peak and nadir. Therefore, to determine differences in the usual daytime cortisol rhythm by age, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity, we measured salivary cortisol levels at four time-points, repeated over four days that included both weekdays and weekend days, in 1693 men and women from a national sample, and used three alternate growth curve specifications for the underlying cortisol rhythm (linear spline, quadratic spline, piece-wise linear-cubic) in order to minimize the impact of sample timing and other methodological issues. Model-predicted mean values of (and demographic and socioeconomic differences in) cortisol peak, nadir, and area under the curve (AUC) were nearly identical across model specifications. Older age and male gender were independently associated with higher cortisol peak, nadir, and AUC. Low education and minority race/ethnicity status were independently associated with lower cortisol peak and higher nadir, but were not associated with AUC. We also found significant cortisol peak and AUC associations with waking time, sleep duration, and workday vs. weekend day status, suggesting the importance of measuring these confounders and of collecting cortisol measurements over multiple days in research studies. We conclude that daytime cortisol levels are higher in older age and in men compared to women, and that the daytime cortisol rhythm is flatter (more blunted) in less privileged segments of society. Flattening of daytime cortisol rhythms may represent one mechanism by which social stressors lead to poor health outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Age; Cortisol area under the curve; Cortisol diurnal rhythm; Cortisol nadir; Cortisol peak; Gender; Race; Socioeconomic status; Spline regression","Adult; Aging; Area Under Curve; Circadian Rhythm; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Saliva; Sex Characteristics; Sleep; Social Class; United States; Wakefulness; Age; Cortisol area under the curve; Cortisol diurnal rhythm; Cortisol nadir; Cortisol peak; Gender; Midlife in the United States; MIDUS; National Study of Daily Experiences; NSDE; Race; SES; Socioeconomic status; Spline regression; hydrocortisone; adult; age; aged; article; circadian rhythm; demography; educational status; ethnic difference; female; hormone determination; human; male; priority journal; race difference; saliva level; sex difference; sleep time; social status; social stress; wakefulness; working time","","hydrocortisone, 50-23-7","","","National Science Foundation's UCLA; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (M01-RR00865); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG020166, P30-AG028748, R01-AG019239, R01-AG033067); John D. and Catherine T.

Whether or not someone has a family member providing assistance is one such factor that could be associated with OOP spending. If family caregivers facilitate better health, health care spending could be reduced. On the other hand, costs would be higher if family members facilitate more (or more costly) care for loved ones. This paper explores the relationship between caregiving arrangements and OOP spending using data from 5045 individuals in the 2000–2016 Health and Retirement Study with Medicare coverage and caregiving needs. We do not find a relationship between family caregiving and OOP health care costs, overall. However, among those with Medicare HMO insurance, having a family caregiver is associated with more spending than having no helper. This is mainly due to differences in spending on prescription medications. © The Author(s) 2023.","activities of daily living; caregiving; health services","Aged; Delivery of Health Care; Health Expenditures; Humans; Medicare; Middle Aged; United States; aged; article; care behavior; caregiver; daily life activity; female; health care cost; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; medicare; prescription; retirement; health care cost; health care delivery; medicare; middle aged; United States","","","","","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS; Administration for Community Living, ACL","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The contents of this publication were developed under a grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR grant number 90 RTGE0002).

Design and Methods: This article extends the current understanding of the sandwich generation by comparing recent transfers of time and money to parents and adult children for men and women and across ages between 35 and 75 years of age. Results: Over 30% of individuals with living parents and adult children provide transfers to two generations. The prevalence of transfers does not differ by age and the differences between men and women are small, though statistically significant. Conditional on providing time transfers, women provide more hours of help than men, particularly to their adult children. The number of hours given to children exceeds the number given to parents. Implications: These findings are the first to show that both men and women are likely to provide transfers to two generations and that transfers to two generations are common across adult ages. Our findings suggest a need to rethink the notion of the sandwich generation, which has focused on women in late middle age, to include men and women across younger and older ages. © The Author 2015.

Concerns about the supply of family care do not adequately recognize factors that may modify the availability and willingness of family and friends to provide care to older persons in need of assistance or the increasing heterogeneity of the older population. In this paper, we set forth a framework that places family caregiving in the context of older adults' care needs, the alternatives available to them, and the outcomes of that care. We focus on care networks, rather than individuals, and discuss the demographic and social changes that may alter the formation of care networks in the future. Last, we identify research areas to prioritize in order to better support planning efforts to care for the aging U.S. population.  © The Author(s) 2023.","Caregiving; Demography; Family issues; Well-being","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Caregivers; Demography; Empirical Research; Family; Humans; adult; aged; aging; care behavior; caregiver; demography; empirical research; family; family counseling; female; human; review; social change; United States; wellbeing; caregiver; demography; family; very elderly","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P30AG012846); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, JHSPH, (U01AG032947); Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, JHSPH; Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging, University of Michigan, MiCDA","Funding text 1: Funding for the Demography of Family Caregiving Network was provided by the Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging through a grant from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (P30AG012846). ; Funding text 2: The views expressed are those of the authors alone and do not reflect those of the funding agency or the authors’ employers.

Utilizing the China Health and Nutrition Survey data from 1989 to 2014, we employ a life course framework to analyze how macro and interpersonal contexts influence mortality and physical health following job loss. Our analysis reveals that, despite short-term income disruptions and persistent income volatility, laid-off workers restored income and gained improved access to various types of health insurance over two decades. In the medium term, we observed increased mortality and cardiovascular diseases, which subsided after a decade. Notably, hypertension emerged as an outcome only after a decade of job loss. While the expansion of urban health insurance schemes contributed to reducing long-term mortality risks, the impact on other health outcomes was marginal. Contrary to patterns observed in Western developed countries, economic mechanisms in transitional China overall played only a minor role in the adverse effects on physical health outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of considering the temporal dynamics and the heterogeneity of impacts across evolving socio-cultural and policy contexts. We also discuss the social-psychological mechanisms that operate within the rich context of transitional China over several decades. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Layoff; Mortality; Physical Health; Transitional China","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (1R03AG064265); National Institutes of Health, NIH","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [1R03AG064265].","Achen C.H., Why lagged dependent variables can suppress the explanatory power of other independent variables, Ann Arbor, 1001, 2000, (2000); Allison P.D., Fixed effects regression models/Paul D.

Objective: In this study, we examined utilization and perceptions of a Web-based social support intervention for informal caregivers of wounded, ill, and injured United States military service members and veterans. Methods: This was a mixed-methods study that used quantitative survey data and qualitative data from focus groups and interviews with informal caregivers enrolled in a Web-based peer support intervention to explore their use and perceptions of the intervention. The intervention was delivered via a website that featured interest groups organized around specific topics, webinars, webchats, and messaging functionality and was moderated by professionally trained peers. This study occurred in the context of a quasi-experimental outcome evaluation of the intervention, where intervention participants were compared with a group of military caregivers who were not enrolled in the intervention. Results: Survey findings indicated that caregivers used the website infrequently, with 60.7% (128/211) visiting the website once a month or less, and passively, with a minority (32/144, 22.2%) of users (ie, those who had visited the website at least once during the past 3 months, N=144) posting comments or links to the network. Nonetheless, most users (121/144, 84.0%) endorsed moderate or greater satisfaction with the website on the survey, and focus group and interview participants reported benefiting sufficiently from passive use of the website (eg, reading posts). Quantitative and qualitative findings suggested that users viewed the website primarily as a source of informational support. Among 63.2% (91/144) of users who completed the survey, the most commonly reported network-related activity was obtaining information from the network's resource library, and focus group and interview participants viewed the network primarily as an informational resource. Focus group and interview participants expressed an unmet need for emotional support and the desire for a more personal touch in the forms of more active engagement with other caregivers in the network and the creation of local, in-person support groups for caregivers. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Web-based peer support interventions may lend themselves better to the provision of informational (vs emotional) support and may need to be supplemented by in-person peer support groups to better meet caregivers' needs for emotional support. © Christine Vaughan, Thomas E Trail, Ammarah Mahmud, Stephanie Dellva, Terri Tanielian, Esther Friedman.

We know very little, however, about who uses these groups and whether they are reaching those with the greatest needs. Objective: To examine whether caregiving factors (ie, caregiving demands and strain, competing demands, access to support and services, and other caregiving characteristics) are related to online community support use and intensity of use. Method: This study used data from a new survey of family caregivers who provide care to disabled military veterans. We used logistic regression models to examine the likelihood of online community support group usage and intensity of use as a function of a variety of caregiving factors. Results: Those with greater caregiving demands were more likely to use online peer support. Specifically, helping the care recipient with more activities was associated with a statistically significantly greater likelihood of visiting an online community support group. Caring for a veteran with a neurological or psychological condition, which, in prior work, suggests more complex care needs, was also positively and significantly related to visiting an online community support group. Hours of care and several other caregiving factors were related to intensity of use. Conclusions: We show that family caregivers with the most caregiving demands are most engaged with online support communities. This suggests that online communities could be used to support the most vulnerable family caregivers. The implications of this work for online support systems are discussed. © 2018 The Author(s).","Caregiving; Internet-Based Interventions; Online Peer Support Groups; Social Support; Veterans","Aged; Caregivers; Family; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Online Social Networking; Peer Group; Self-Help Groups; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Veterans; adult; army; article; caregiver; disabled person; female; human; human experiment; Internet; male; online support group; recipient; social support; veteran; aged; family; middle aged; peer group; questionnaire; self help; social support; socioeconomics; statistical model; United States","","","","","Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, BMSF","This work was supported by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation.","Families Caring for An Aging America, (2016); Feinberg L.F., Newman S.L., Gray L., Kolb K.N., The State of the States in Family Caregiver Support: A 50-State Study, (2004); Wolff J.L., Kasper J.D., Caregivers of frail elders: Updating a national profile, Gerontologist, 46, 3, pp. 344-356, (2006); Bauer J.M., Sousa-Poza A., Impacts of informal caregiving on caregiver employment, health, family, J Popul Ageing, 8, 3, pp. 113-145, (2015); Brodaty H., Donkin M., Family caregivers of people with dementia, Dialogues Clin Neurosci, 11, 2, (2009); Dam A.E.H., De Vugt M.E., Klinkenberg I.P.M., Et al., A systematic review of social support interventions for caregivers of people with dementia: Are they doing what they promise, Maturitas, 85, pp. 117-130, (2016); Wright S.D., Lund D.A., Pett M.A., Et al., The assessment of support group experiences by caregivers of dementia patients, Clin Gerontologist, 6, 4, pp. 35-60, (1987); Wright K., Muhtaseb A., Personal relationships and computer-mediated support groups, Computer-Mediated Communication in Personal Relationships, pp. 137-155, (2011); Fox S., The Social Life of Health Information, Washington DC: Pew Internet&American Life Project, (2011); Laranjo L., Arguel A., Neves A.L., Et al., The influence of social networking sites on health behavior change: A systematic review and meta-analysis, J Am Med Inform Assoc 2015, 22, 1, pp. 243-256; Guay C., Auger C., Gelinas-Bronsard D., Et al., Components and outcomes of internet-based interventions for caregivers of older adults: Systematic review, J Med Internet Res, 1, (2017); Kraut R., Kiesler S., Boneva B., Et al., Internet paradox revisited, J Social Isssues, 58, 1, pp. 49-74, (2002); McKenna K.Y., Bargh J.A., Coming out in the age of the internet: Identity demarginalization"" through virtual group participation, J Pers Soc Psychol, 75, 3, (1998); Han J.Y., Hou J., Kim E., Et al., Lurking as an active participation process: A longitudinal investigation of engagement with an online cancer support group, Health Commun, 29, 9, pp. 911-923, (2014); Ramchand R., Tanielian T., Fisher M.P., Hidden Heroes: America's Military Caregivers, (2014); Van Uden-Kraan C.F., Chc D., Taal E., Et al., Self-reported differences in empowerment between lurkers and posters in online patient support groups, J Med Internet Res, 10, 2, (2008); Novak M., Guest C., Application of a multidimensional caregiver burden inventory, Gerontologist, 29, 6, pp. 798-803, (1989); Tanielian T., Jaycox L.H., InvisibleWounds OfWar: Psychological and Cognitive Injuries, Their Consequences, Services to Assist Recovery, (2008); Hosmer D., Lemeshow S., Applied Logistic Regression 2nd Ed, (2000); Degeneffe C.E., Family caregiving and traumatic brain injury, Health Soc Work, 26, 4, pp. 257-268, (2001); Etters L., Goodall D., Harrison B.E., Caregiver burden among dementia patient caregivers: A review of the literature, J Am Assoc Nurse Pract, 20, 8, pp. 423-428, (2008); Bass E., Golding H.L.W., The Veterans Health Administration's Treatment of PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury among Recent Combat Veterans, (2012); Calhoun P.S., Beckham J.C., Bosworth H.B., Caregiver burden and psychological distress in partners of veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, J Trauma Stress, 15, 3, pp. 205-212, (2002)","E.M.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of childcare, work status, and intensity of caregiving among men and women caring for older adults (n = 17,271). Methods: Controlling for sociodemographic factors, separate logistic regression analysis for women and men were carried out to assess the main and interaction effects of childcare, work status, and intensity of caregiving on number of poor mental and physical health days in the last month. Results: Intensive caregiving demands had adverse effects on both women and men, but being in the workforce was beneficial to both men and women. Women with children at home reported adverse mental health effects but better physical health, while men with children at home reported adverse physical health effects. For women, the combination of not working, children in the household, and high-intensity caregiving were most detrimental to their mental health. Among men, those not working with children in the household, regardless of caregiving intensity, were at highest risk of adverse mental health effects. Discussion: Our findings identify caregivers at high risk of adverse outcomes but also point to the need for more fine-grained analyses of how families negotiate the allocation of childcare, work, and caregiving responsibilities over time. © 2023 Gerontological Society of America.

Coresidence is one way that middle-aged offspring assist vulnerable, aging parents. This study investigated which characteristics of widowed mothers and adult children predict coresidence. When coresidence occurred, the analysis explored how individual children's characteristics were associated with their coresidence with the mother. Method. Survey data from adults 53-54 years old in 1993 (N = 2,324) and a random sibling reported about their living situation, other siblings, and their mother, median age 80. Results. Logistic regressions revealed that mothers in poor health, who were older, and who had a daughter were more likely to live with a child. Among coresiding families, results from discrete choice conditional logit models showed that widowed mothers were more likely to live with an unmarried son than an unmarried daughter. Married children were less likely to coreside than unmarried children, but married daughters were more likely than married sons to coreside. Past receipt of financial help from parents was not associated with coresidence. Coresidence was more likely for those with a close relationship with the mother. Discussion. The discussion considers coresidence as an intergenerational transfer and its importance for the contemporary aging society. Data are needed on characteristics of all offspring to test theories about parent-child relationships. © The Author 2013.","Demography; Intergenerational relations; Living arrangements; Widowhood","Adult; Adult Children; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Health Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Marital Status; Middle Aged; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers; Residence Characteristics; Siblings; Widowhood; Wisconsin; Demography; Intergenerational relations; Living arrangements; Widowhood.; adult; adult child; article; demography; female; health status; human; human relation; Living arrangements; longitudinal study; male; marriage; middle aged; mother; mother child relation; sibling; statistical model; statistics; United States; very elderly; widow; Widowhood.","","","","","Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Vilas Estate Trust; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R24-HD41022); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (AG-21079, R01AG009775); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF; Spencer Foundation","We report results from three conditional logit models of coresidence on children’s characteristics.

Design: This is a cross-sectional design. Setting: Data were collected from three clinical sites at the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Wisconsin–Madison; and Georgetown, in the Washington, DC area. Participants: The participants were a group of 863 U.S. adults aged 25–76 years who participated in the Biomarker Project in the Midlife in the United States Refresher study. Measurement: Subjective sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and actigraphic sleep measures included sleep-onset latency, sleep efficiency, wake time after sleep onset, and total sleep time. Participants retrospectively reported whether they experienced 18 adverse events before age 18 years and the ages they experienced the events. Results: Childhood adversity, operationalized as quantity (i.e., the total number of adverse events or experiencing 3 or more adverse events) and timing (i.e., experiencing adverse events during both childhood and adolescence) of adverse events, was related to worse subjective and actigraphic sleep (except for total sleep time) after adjusting for age, sex, and race. Models using the cumulative (i.e. dose-response) number of adverse events fit better than models using the timing and type specifications of childhood adversity in relation to subjective or actigraphic sleep measures (except for total sleep time). Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of considering the quantity of childhood adversity in relation to self-reported and actigraphically measured sleep in adulthood. © 2020 National Sleep Foundation","Actigraphy;

But some of these costs can potentially be offset through family caregivers who may serve as substitutes for formal care or directly improve the care recipient's health and reduce health care utilization and expenditures. This article reviews the current literature to determine whether it is possible through existing work to compare the costs of care for individuals with versus without family caregivers and, if not, where the data, measurement, and other methodological challenges lie. Research Design and Methods A mapping review of published works containing information on health care utilization and expenditures and caregiving was conducted. A narrative approach was used to review and identify methodological challenges in the literature. Results Our review identified 47 articles that met our criteria and had information on caregiving and health care costs or utilization. Although findings were mixed, for the most part, having a family caregiver was associated with reduced health care utilization and a decreased risk of institutionalization however, the precise difference in health care expenditures for individuals with caregivers compared to those without was rarely examined, and findings were inconsistent across articles reviewed. Discussion and Implications The number of family caregivers providing care to loved ones is expected to grow with the aging of the Baby Boomers. Various programs and policies have been proposed to support these caregivers, but they could be costly. These costs can potentially be offset if family caregivers reduce health care spending. More research is needed, however, to quantify the savings stemming from family caregiving. © The Author(s) 2019.

Previous research on social disparities in cognitive aging, however, has been unable to address both race/ethnicity and nativity (REN) in a nationally-representative sample of US adults leaving unanswered questions about potentially “paradoxical” advantages of Mexican ethnic-origins and the role of nativity, socioeconomic status (SES), and enclave residence. We employ biennial assessments of cognitive functioning to study prevalent and incident cognitive impairment (CI) within the three largest US REN groups: US-born non-Hispanic whites (US-NHW), US-born non-Hispanic blacks (US-NHB), US-born Mexican Americans (US-MA), and foreign-born Mexican Americans (FB-MA). Data come from a nationally-representative sample of community-dwelling older adults in the Health and Retirement Study linked with the 2000 Census and followed over 10 years (N = 8,433). Large disadvantages in prevalent and incident CI were observed for all REN minorities respective to US-born non-Hispanic whites. Individual and neighborhood SES accounted substantially for these disadvantages and revealed an immigrant advantage: FB-MA odds of prevalent CI were about half those of US-NHW and hazards of incident CI were about half those of US-MA. Residence in an immigrant enclave was protective of prevalent CI among FB-MA. The findings illuminate important directions for research into the sources of cognitive risk and resilience and provide guidance about CI screening within the increasingly diverse aging US population. © 2017, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2017, The American Geriatrics Society","cognitive aging; immigrant enclaves; race/ethnicity and nativity; socioeconomic factors","Cognitive Dysfunction; Continental Population Groups; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Health Surveys; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mexican Americans; Middle Aged; Residence Characteristics; Social Class; United States; adult; Article; Black person; Caucasian; cognition; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; educational status; ethnic difference; female; Hispanic; human; immigrant; incidence; major clinical study; male; Mexican American; middle aged; nativity; neighborhood; prevalence; race difference; social status; ancestry group; cognitive defect; demography; ethnology; health survey; Hispanic; longitudinal study; migrant; social class; statistics and numerical data; United States","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (U01AG009740)","","Riosmena F., Wong R., Palloni A., Migration selection, protection, and acculturation in health: A binational perspective on older adults, Demography, 50, pp. 1039-1064, (2013); Hurd M.D., Martorell P., Delavande A., Et al., Monetary costs of dementia in the United States, N Engl J Med, 368, pp. 1326-1334, (2013); Wilmoth J., A demographic profile of older immigrants, Public Policy Aging Rep, 22, pp. 8-11, (2012); Zhang Z., Hayward M.D., Yu Y.L., Life course pathways to racial disparities in cognitive impairment among older Americans, J Health Soc Behav, 57, pp. 184-199, (2016); Glymour M.M., Manly J.J., Lifecourse social conditions and racial and ethnic patterns of cognitive aging, Neuropsychol Rev, 18, pp. 223-254, (2008); Hill T.D., Angel J.L., Balistreri K.S., Does the ‘healthy immigrant effect’ extend to cognitive aging?, Aging, Health and Longevity in the Mexican-Origin Population, pp. 19-33, (2012); Hill T.D., Angel J.L., Balistreri K.S., Et al., Immigrant status and cognitive functioning in late-life: An examination of gender variations in the healthy immigrant effect, Soc Sci Med, 75, pp. 2076-2084, (2012); Eschbach K., Ostir G.V., Patel K.V., Et al., Neighborhood context and mortality among older Mexican Americans: Is there a barrio advantage?, Am J Public Health, 94, pp. 1807-1812, (2004); Ostir G.V., Eschbach K., Markides K.S., Et al., Neighbourhood composition and depressive symptoms among older Mexican Americans, J Epidemiol Community Health, 57, pp. 987-992, (2003); Cagney K.A., Browning C.R., Wallace D.M., The Latino paradox in neighborhood context: The case of asthma and other respiratory conditions, Am J Public Health, 97, pp. 919-925, (2007); Osypuk T.L., Bates L.M., Acevedo-Garcia D., Another Mexican birthweight paradox?

However, much of the work to date suffers from four limitations. First, none of the U.S.-based studies examine the association at the national level. Second, no studies have examined three important hypothesized mechanisms - neighborhood socioeconomic status and neighborhood social and physical characteristics - which are significantly correlated with both neighborhood age structure and health. Third, no U.S. study has longitudinally examined cognitive health trajectories. We build on this literature by examining nine years of nationally-representative data from the Health and Retirement Study (2002–2010) on men and women aged 51 and over linked with Census data to examine the relationship between the percentage of adults 65 and older in a neighborhood and individual cognitive health trajectories. Our results indicate that living in a neighborhood with a greater percentage of older adults is related to better individual cognition at baseline but we did not find any significant association with cognitive decline. We also explored potential mediators including neighborhood socioeconomic status, perceived neighborhood cohesion and perceived neighborhood physical disorder. We did not find evidence that neighborhood socioeconomic status explains this relationship; however, there is suggestive evidence that perceived cohesion and disorder may explain some of the association between age structure and cognition. Although more work is needed to identify the precise mechanisms, this work may suggest a potential contextual target for public health interventions to prevent cognitive impairment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive decline; Dementia; Health and retirement study; Neighborhood age structure; Social cohesion; Socioeconomic status","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cognition; Female; Health Status; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Residence Characteristics; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; United States; adult; age structure; cognition; mental health; neighborhood; socioeconomic status; adult; age; age distribution; aging; Article; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; cognition; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation analysis; daily life activity; ethnicity; female; functional assessment; functional status; gender; health status; human; human experiment; male; mental health; neighborhood; normal human; retirement; social behavior; social environment; social interaction; social status; aged; aging; demography; human relation; psychology; social support; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; United States; very elderly","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG043960)","This work was supported by Grant R01-AG043960 (PI: Regina Shih) from the National Institute on Aging.

Medicaid’s Balancing Incentive Program (BIP) (2011–2015) provided assistance for U.S. states to increase access to HCBS through infrastructure changes and spending benchmarks. We combined longitudinal data from the 2008–2019 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and Minimum Data Set and used survival modeling to examine the association between BIP exposure (living in a BIP-participant state vs. not) and time to long-term institutionalization (LTI, defined as a nursing home episode of 90+ days) among dual enrollees ages 65 and older. In the main effects model, BIP exposure was not associated with hazard of LTI. Interaction models showed that BIP exposure was associated with a lower hazard of LTI among Hispanic/Latinx enrollees, while the opposite was true among non-Hispanic White enrollees. Our findings suggest the outcomes of Medicaid rebalancing efforts may differ across enrollee subgroups. © The Author(s) 2024.","home- and community-based care and services; long-term services and supports; nursing homes","","","","","","National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (R01MD010360-03S1); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R21AG069787); National Institute on Aging, NIA","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by funding from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01MD010360 and R01MD010360-03S1) and the National Institute on Aging (R21AG069787).

However, significant barriers can prevent access to home and community-based services (HCBS) among older adults and persons with dementia. Qualitative research on potential innovations and solutions in the contemporary context with attention to a wider range of state-level policy contexts is limited. Drawing on interviews with 49 key informants including state Medicaid officials, HCBS providers, and advocates for persons with dementia across 11 states, we examined perceived solutions to barriers. Key informants articulated a range of potential solutions and innovations, ranging from tangible or realized policy changes to ‘magic wand’ solutions.

Differences in state policies may make this more feasible in some states than others. Yet no study to date has examined trends in the long-term care workforce across states. Using state-level data on direct care workers from the period 2009–20, we examine trends in the sizes of the nursing home and home care workforces. We show that since 2009 most states have increased the size of their home care workforces and decreased the size of their nursing home workforces, but there is substantial variation across states in the magnitude of these changes. In addition, the gap between leading and lagging states in home care workforce size has grown over time. This suggests that more targeted efforts may be needed to ensure that people with disabling conditions can have their needs met in their desired setting across the nation. © 2021, Project HOPE.

Methods: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1,037 American Life Panel respondents aged 18 years and older. Results: Nearly a third of Americans who arranged paid care sought gray market care for persons with dementia, and most (65%) combined it with unpaid care. Respondents who arranged gray market care had 66% lower odds of currently working, and those living in rural areas had an almost 5-times higher odds of arranging dementia gray market care. Discussion: Gray market care represents a substantial proportion of paid, long-term care for older adults and may fill gaps in access to care. © The Author(s) 2021.","Alzheimer’s disease; caregiving; dementia; long-term services & supports","Aged; Aging; Dementia; Humans; Long-Term Care; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; adult; aging; analysis of variance; Article; bivariate analysis; care behavior; caregiver; consumer; controlled study; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; dementia; demography; employment status; family income; female; health care; health service; home health agency; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; market; multivariate logistic regression analysis; prevalence; probability; questionnaire; rural area; self report; young adult; aged; aging; dementia; prevalence; United States","","","","","National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (R01MD010360)","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities [R01MD010360].

However, parents' investment in their offspring's schooling may yield significant returns for parents themselves in later life. For instance, well-educated offspring have greater knowledge of health and technology to share with their parents and more financial means to provide for them than do their less-educated counterparts. We use data from the 1992-2006 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine whether adult offspring's educational attainments are associated with parents' survival in the United States. We show that adult offspring's educational attainments have independent effects on their parents' mortality, even after controlling for parents' own socioeconomic resources. This relationship is more pronounced for deaths that are linked to behavioral factors: most notably, chronic lower respiratory disease and lung cancer. Furthermore, at least part of the association between offspring's schooling and parents' survival may be explained by parents' health behaviors, including smoking and physical activity. These findings suggest that one way to influence the health of the elderly is through their offspring. To harness the full value of schooling for health, then, a family and multigenerational perspective is needed. © 2014 Population Association of America.","Education; Intergenerational; Mortality; Survival analysis","Caregivers; Educational Status; Family; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Parents; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; article; caregiver; educational status; family; female; health behavior; human; lifestyle; male; middle aged; mortality; parent; smoking; socioeconomics; statistics; United States","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD041022); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF; University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA","The authors thank the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health & Society Scholars program and the UCLA Interdisciplinary Relationship Science Program sponsored by the National Science Foundation for their financial support.

Using data from the National Study of Midlife Development in the United States and the National Study of Daily Experience substudy, we identified curvilinear relations between adult reports of parental affection in childhood and adult diurnal cortisol rhythms. Reports of both very affectionate and very unaffectionate parental relations in childhood were associated with flatter diurnal rhythms, suggesting potential dysregulation of the HPA axis at both extremes of family environment. Participants in the bottom tertile showed more signs of HPA axis dysregulation than those in the top tertile. We discuss processes that may underlie these effects, with reference to the theory of allostatic load. © The Author (2010).

Methods We examined differences in cognitive trajectories according to the racial/ethnic characteristics of the residential environment. On the basis of 63 996 person-years of data from a nationally representative cohort of 6150 adults over the age of 50 years from the Health and Retirement Study, we used multivariate linear mixed models to determine the effect of neighbourhood racial/ethnic composition and county-level segregation on cognitive function and cognitive decline over a 10-year period. Results: In models adjusting for individual demographic and health characteristics, Hispanic composition had a significant positive association with cognitive function (standardised β=0.136, p<0.05) and moderate evidence of an association with greater cognitive decline (standardised β=-0.014, p=0.09). Greater Hispanicwhite segregation was associated with statistically significant higher cognitive function at baseline (standardised β=0.099, p<0.001) and greater cognitive decline (standardised β=-0.011, p<0.01). For a 20 percentage-point increase in Hispanic composition and segregation, the observed associations implied 1 and 1.25 additional years of cognitive ageing over 10 years, respectively. These effects did not differ by individual race/ethnicity and were not explained by neighbourhood socioeconomic status or neighbourhood selection. Black composition and black-white segregation did not have a significant influence on cognitive ageing. Discussion: This study demonstrates disparities in the progression of cognitive ageing according to racial/ethnic characteristics of the neighbourhood environment.","","African Americans; Aged; Aging; Censuses; Cognition Disorders; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Behavior; Health Status Disparities; Health Surveys; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Racism; Residence Characteristics; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; aging population; cognition; data interpretation; ethnicity; neighborhood; population decline; public health; socioeconomic status; African American; aged; aging; Caucasian; classification; Cognition Disorders; demography; economics; epidemiology; ethnology; female; health behavior; health disparity; health survey; Hispanic; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; population research; psychology; racism; social environment; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; United States","","","","","National Institute on Aging, (R01-AG043960); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG043960)","","Insel T.R., Landis S.C., Collins F.S., The NIH brain initiative, Science, 340, pp. 687-688, (2013); Hurd M.D., Martorell P., Delavande A., Et al., Monetary costs of dementia in the United States, N Eng J Med, 368, pp. 1326-1334, (2013); Daviglus M.L., Bell C.C., Berrettini W., Et al., National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Conference statement: preventing Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline, Ann Intern Med, 153, pp. 176-181, (2010); Ritchie K., Carriere I., Ritchie C.W., Et al., Designing prevention programmes to reduce incidence of dementia: prospective cohort study of modifiable risk factors, BMJ, 341, (2010); White K., Borrell L.N., Racial/ethnic residential segregation: framing the context of health risk and health disparities, Health Place, 17, pp. 438-448, (2011); Warner E.T., Gomez S.L., Impact of neighborhood racial composition and metropolitan residential segregation on disparities in breast cancer stage at diagnosis and survival between black and white women in California, J Community Health, 35, pp. 398-408, (2010); Chang V.W., Racial residential segregation and weight status among US adults, Soc Sci Med, 63, pp. 1289-1303, (2006); Mair C., Diez Roux A.V., Osypuk T.L., Et al., Is neighborhood racial/ethnic composition associated with depressive symptoms?

Data Sources: Governmental stakeholders (Medicaid administrators) and nongovernmental stakeholders (service providers and consumer advocates) (n = 30) from eight states that participated in BIP. Study Design: We conducted key informant interviews. Data Collection: Interviews followed a semi-structured guide and were professionally transcribed. We thematically coded transcripts using an iterative codebook with a priori and emergent codes. Principal Findings: Stakeholders reported that BIP participation had a range of impacts on the HCBS ecosystem, often beyond the mandated structural reforms. BIP activities were believed to have changed the culture of HCBS in some states, for example, at the level of state administration or in the provision of HCBS to consumers. Stakeholders also described significant improvements in cross-stakeholder relationships and communication, for example, in the context of troubleshooting consumers' unmet needs or improvements in the states' responsiveness to providers' inquiries. Stakeholders believed that within-state data harmonization undertaken through Core Standardized Assessment (CSA) was a positive impact of BIP, particularly with regard to its utility for administrative data, care planning, and patient-centeredness. Two stakeholders also voiced concerns regarding the validity of spending-based rebalancing metrics. The impacts that stakeholders attributed to BIP may help create a more sustained rebalancing environment through their changes to the ecosystem, including infrastructure upgrades, data harmonization, collaboration across stakeholders and agencies, more patient-centeredness, and greater recognition of HCBS. Conclusions: Our findings highlight additional BIP impacts to monitor over the longer term and to consider in evaluations of future rebalancing efforts. Some potential impacts of BIP are more readily quantified (e.g., HCBS spending), while others are less likely to be formally assessed (e.g., improved stakeholder cooperation). These latter impacts are likely instrumental to future rebalancing efforts. © 2021 Health Research and Educational Trust","Balancing Incentive Program; community integration; home- and community-based services; long-term care; Medicaid","Community Health Services; Home Care Services; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Long-Term Care; Medicaid; Qualitative Research; Stakeholder Participation; United States; adult; article; clinical article; community integration; consumer; ecosystem; female; genetic transcription; human; incentive; interview; long term care; male; medicaid; program impact; quantitative analysis; validity; community care; economics; home care; long term care; medicaid; qualitative research; stakeholder engagement; United States","","","","","National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (R01MD010360)","This research was supported by R01MD010360 (PI: Shih).

Older adults, in particular, could be affected by the spiral of community changes that result from foreclosures, but we know very little about how the foreclosure crisis is related to older adult health, in particular cognition. Method: This article uses growth curve models and data from the Health and Retirement Study matched to Census and county-level foreclosure data to examine whether community foreclosures are related to older adults' cognitive health and the mechanisms responsible. Results: We find that higher rates of county-level foreclosures are associated with a faster decline in individual cognition at older ages. Although we examined an extensive number of individual and community mechanisms, including individual housing wealth and depressive symptoms, community structural factors, social factors, and perceptions of physical disorder and cohesion, none of the mechanisms examined here explained this relationship. Discussion: This study shows that the adverse consequences of home foreclosures spill over to the local community, with implications for the cognitive health of older adults.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Cognitive decline; Community physical disorder; Community social cohesion; Foreclosures; Health and Retirement Study","","","","","","Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 AG043960); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (U01AG009740); National Institute on Aging, NIA","This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (R01 AG043960 to R.

Using longitudinal and nationally representative data, we examined the effects of food insecurity on dementia risk among older adults. METHODS: Data were from 3,232 adults (≥65 years) from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Food insecurity was assessed biennially using the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module from 2015 to 2019. Probable dementia risk was assessed biennially using the Eight-Item Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia from 2017 to 2021. Inverse probability weighting and marginal structural models were used to account for the time-varying nature of food insecurity and sociodemographic and health confounders. RESULTS: After accounting for baseline and time-varying sociodemographic and health covariates, there was a 2-fold higher association between food insecurity and probable dementia risk (odds ratio 2.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-3.98). The results were robust to expanding the exposure to include marginal food security and the outcome to include informant-reported memory loss. Furthermore, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the association of food insecurity and probable dementia risk by sex, race, and ethnicity, or participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program. DISCUSSION: Food insecurity is a modifiable social determinant of health. Interventions and policies are needed to reduce food insecurity and promote healthy aging for older adults. © The Author(s) 2024.

We sought to understand the ways the Medicaid Balancing Incentive Program (BIP) facilitated increased use of HIT to increase access to HCBS. Method: Qualitative analysis of interviews with 30 Medicaid administrators, service agency providers, and consumer advocates. Results: Although stakeholders perceived several benefits to greater HIT use, they highlighted critical challenges to effective adoption within the long-term services and supports (LTSS) system, including lack of extant expertise/knowledge about HIT, the limited reach of HIT among rural and disabled beneficiaries, burdensome procurement processes, and the ongoing resources required to maintain up-to-date HIT solutions. Conclusion: The structural reforms required by BIP gave states an opportunity to modernize their HCBS systems through use of HIT. However, barriers to HIT adoption persist, underscoring the need for continued support as part of future rebalancing efforts. © The Author(s) 2020.","home- and community-based care and services; information technology; long-term services and supports; qualitative methods","Community Health Services; Home Care Services; Humans; Long-Term Care; Medicaid; Medical Informatics; United States; administrative personnel; adoption; article; consumer; disabled person; human; information technology; interview; medicaid; medical information; qualitative analysis; community care; home care; long term care; medical informatics; United States","","","","","National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (R01MD010360); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD","","Arora K., Ashida S., Mobley E.M., Sample G.J., The impact of consolidating AAA on the delivery of HCBS: Evidence from Iowa, Journal of Applied Gerontology, 39, pp. 751-759, (2020); Caldwell B., Cooper M., Reid L.G., Vanderheiden G., Web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, (2008); Cascio M.A., Lee E., Vaudrin N., Freedman D.A., A team-based approach to open coding: Considerations for creating intercoder consensus, International Journal of Qualitative Methods, 31, 2, pp. 116-130, (2019); Eiken S., Sredl K., Burwell B., Amos A., Medicaid expenditures for long-term services and supports in FY 2016, (2018); Eiken S., Sredl K., Burwell B., Woodward R., Medicaid expenditures for long-term services and supports (LTSS) in FY 2015, (2017); Frandsen B.R., Joynt K.E., Rebitzer J.B., Jha A.K., Care fragmentation, quality, and costs among chronically ill patients, The American Journal of Managed Care, 21, pp. 355-362, (2015); Gordon N.P., Hornbrook M.C., Differences in access to and preferences for using patient portals and other eHealth technologies based on race, ethnicity, and age: A database and Survey Study of Seniors in a Large Health Plan, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 18, 3, (2016); Hersh W., A stimulus to define informatics and health information technology, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 9, (2009); Kontos E., Blake K., Chou W., Prestin A., Predictors of eHealth usage: Insights on the digital divide from the Health Information National Trends Survey 2012, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16, 7, (2014); Lee J., Giovenco D., Operario D., Patterns of health information technology use according to sexual orientation among US adults aged 50 and older: Findings from a National Representative Sample-National Health Interview Survey 2013-2014, Journal of Health Communication, 22, pp. 666-671, (2017); Musumeci M., Chidambaram P., Watts M.O., Medicaid home and community-based services enrollment and spending, (2019); Nahm E.-S., Zhu S., Bellantoni M., Keldsen L., Charters K., Russomanno V., Smith L., Patient portal use among older adults: What is really happening nationwide?, Journal of Applied Gerontology, 39, 4, pp. 442-450, (2020); Snyder C.F., Wu A.W., Miller R.S., Jensen R., Bantug E.T., Wolff A.C., The role of informatics in promoting patient-centered care, Cancer Journal, 17, 4, pp. 211-218, (2011); Soar J., Seo Y., Health and aged care enabled by information technology, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1114, pp. 154-161, (2007); Dedoose Version 7, web application for managing, analyzing, and presenting qualitative and mixed method research data, (2017); Srivastava P., Hopwood N., A practical iterative framework for qualitative data analysis, International Journal of Qualitative Methods, 8, 1, pp. 76-84, (2009); Steichen O., Gregg W., Health information technology coordination to support patient-centered care coordination, Yearbook of Medical Informatics, 10, 1, pp. 34-37, (2015); Theis S., Schafer D., Brohl C., Schafer K., Rasche P., Wille M., Mertens A., Predicting technology usage by health information need of older adults: Implications for eHealth technology, Work, 62, 3, pp. 443-457, (2019); Whittemore R., Chase S., Mandle C., Validity in qualitative research, Qualitative Health Research, 11, 4, pp. 522-537, (2001)","S.C.

The educational attainment of a parent is a powerful predictor of children’s wellbeing, but little is known about why this is the case. Methods. We used the 2008 General Social Survey to explore factors that may explain the relationship between one’s father’s education and one’s own mortality. These include (1) intellectual traits, (2) material wellbeing, (3) psychological characteristics, (4) personality characteristics, and (5) social capital. Results. The education credentials of one’s father are significantly associated with one’s risk of death. The strongest mediators are own educational attainment, family income, home ownership, and subjective socioeconomic status. To a lesser extent, respondents’ happiness with friends and family and social bonding were also pathways. Conclusions. A father’s educational attainment appears to influence his children’s health, and may do so not only by improving the child’s material circumstances but also through his or her educational attainment and other psychological and social characteristics. © Meharry Medical College.","General Social Survey; Intergenerational; National Death Index; Socioeconomic status; Survival analysis","Adult; Child; Educational Status; Fathers; Female; Humans; Income; Intergenerational Relations; Male; Parents; Social Class; Surveys and Questionnaires; death; education; father; friend; happiness; human; human experiment; mediator; mental capacity; mortality; personality; social bonding; social capital; social status; survival analysis; wellbeing; adult; child; educational status; female; human relation; income; male; parent; questionnaire; social class","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R21HD075664)","","Olson K.W., The GI Bill and higher education: Success and surprise, Am Q, 25, 5, pp. 596-610, (1973); Seeman T., Epel E., Gruenewald T., Et al., Socio-economic differentials in peripheral biology: Cumulative allostatic load, Ann N Y Acad Sci, 1186, pp. 223-239, (2010); Muennig P., Can universal pre-kindergarten programs improve population health and longevity?

While evidence for this association has mounted, a fundamental set of questions about how to operationalize adverse events has been understudied. Method: We used data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States to examine how quantity, timing, and types of adverse events in childhood are associated with adult cardiometabolic health. Results: The best-fitting specification of quantity of events was a linear measure reflecting a dose-response relationship. Timing of event mattered less than repeated exposure to events. Regarding the type of event, academic interruptions and sexual/physical abuse were most important. Adverse childhood events elevated the risk of diabetes and obesity similarly for men and women but had a greater impact on women's risk of heart disease. Discussion: Findings demonstrate the insights that can be gleaned about the early-life origins of adult health by examining operationalization of childhood exposures. © SAGE Publications.","childhood; diabetes; gender; heart disease; life course; midlife; obesity","Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Risk; Time Factors; United States; adult; aged; childhood trauma survivor; diabetes mellitus; female; Heart Diseases; human; male; middle aged; obesity; risk; statistics and numerical data; time factor; United States","","","","","National Institute of Health; UCLA CTRC, (P30-AG028748); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01-AG020166); National Center for Research Resources, NCRR, (M01RR000865); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF; John D. and Catherine T.

We expand on this by incorporating data on caregivers’ social networks and exploring the relationships between own and network changes in care during the pandemic and caregiver wellbeing. Methods: We use nationally representative data from 1,876 family and friend caregivers in the first wave of our Care Network Connections over Time study (fielded 12/17/2020–1/4/2021) who had provided care continuously since before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Caregivers were asked about the amount of care that they and each member of their social networks were providing at the time of the survey relative to before the pandemic. We use multivariate regression models to examine the associations between five caregiver wellbeing outcomes and changes in care, and explore the moderating role of networks’ changes in care. Results: Among caregivers who had provided care since prior to the pandemic, most increased (42.0%) or maintained the same (40.8%) care. Their networks also typically increased (33.4%) or maintained (46.5%) care. Increasing one’s own care provision was associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and emotional difficulty than maintaining stable care. Among those who increased care, these levels were highest when the network also increased or decreased care. Discussion: Increased care provision was most strongly associated with poor caregiver wellbeing in contexts where caregivers’ social networks also changed care provisions. Supports for caregivers undertaking additional care tasks should take into account caregivers’ networks. © The Author(s) 2024.","COVID-19; Family caregiving; Mental health; Social support","Anxiety Disorders; Caregivers; Emotions; Humans; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires; anxiety disorder; caregiver; emotion; human; pandemic; psychology; questionnaire","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 AG066194); National Institutes of Health, NIH","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01 AG066194 to E.M.

Method: Biennial data from adults aged 51 and older in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and discrete-time survival models were used to assess the likelihood of community-based moves from 2000 to 2010 as a function of 11 measures of health and functioning. Results: Respondents diagnosed with heart disease, stroke, hypertension, lung disease, and psychiatric problems were more likely to move during the study period than those with no such diagnosis. Changes in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living functioning, cognitive impairment, and falls were also related to a greater likelihood of moving during the study period. Cancer and diabetes were not related to overall moves, although diabetes was associated with an increased likelihood of local moves. For the most part, it was longstanding not recent diagnoses that were significantly related to the likelihood of moving. Discussion: Although some health conditions precipitate moves among middle-aged and older adults, others do not. This work has important implications for understanding the role of different aspects of health and functioning in the likelihood of migration among older adults. © 2015 The Author.

Objective: This study aimed to test whether military caregivers who joined a new online peer support community or engaged with an existing online community experienced decreased perceived social isolation and improved depressive symptoms over 6 months. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study of 212 military caregivers who had newly joined an online community and those who were members of other military caregiver groups. Multiple indicators of perceived social isolation and depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Results: Compared with caregivers in the comparison group, caregivers who joined the new group experienced less perceived social isolation at 3 months (eg, number of caregivers in social network [unstandardized regression coefficients] b=0.49, SE 0.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.02), but this effect did not persist at 6 months. Those who engaged more with new or existing groups experienced less perceived social isolation over time (eg, number of caregivers in social network b=0.18, SE 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.27), and this relationship was mediated by increased interactions with other military caregivers (95% CI 0.0046 to 0.0961). Engagement with an online group was not associated with improvements in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Online communities might help reduce social isolation when members engage with the group, but more intensive treatment is needed to improve depressive symptoms. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Social exposure is one potential conduit for HCBS knowledge. To understand the general population’s social exposure to HCBS—that is, knowing someone who has used HCBS (including one’s self)—we fielded a survey item with a nationally representative panel of U.S. adults. An estimated 53% of U.S. adults reported not knowing anyone who had used HCBS. Exposure rates were low across specific HCBS types (6%–28%). Women had greater exposure than men for eight of the 11 HCBS. We also found differences by age, racial/ethnic identity, rurality, education, and income. Increasing the general public’s awareness of HCBS may facilitate access when services are needed, enhance readiness for aging in place, and increase the visibility and inclusion of older adults, persons with disabilities, and caregivers. © The Author(s) 2022.","aging in place; community integration; home- and community-based services; older adults; persons with disabilities","Aged; Caregivers; Community Health Services; Female; Home Care Services; Humans; Independent Living; Male; Medicaid; Social Welfare; United States; adult; aged; article; awareness; caregiver; community integration; disabled person; education; ethnic identity; female; human; human experiment; independent living; male; visibility; community care; home care; independent living; medicaid; social welfare; United States","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, NIMHD, (R01MD010360)","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01MD010360). ; Funding text 2: We are grateful for the constructive reviews provided by anonymous peer reviewers.
