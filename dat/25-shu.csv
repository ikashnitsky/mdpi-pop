This emergent approach is a dialectic research process that is both deductive and inductive. The data mining approach automatically or semi-automatically considers a larger number of joint, interactive, and independent predictors to address causal heterogeneity and improve prediction. Instead of challenging the conventional model-building approach, it plays an important complementary role in improving model goodness of fit, revealing valid and significant hidden patterns in data, identifying nonlinear and non-additive effects, providing insights into data developments, methods, and theory, and enriching scientific discovery. Machine learning builds models and algorithms by learning and improving from data when the explicit model structure is unclear and algorithms with good performance are difficult to attain. The most recent development is to incorporate this new paradigm of predictive modeling with the classical approach of parameter estimation regressions to produce improved models that combine explanation and prediction. © 2022 The Authors","big data; causal discovery; data mining; Knowledge discovery; machine learning; predition","Data Mining; Humans; Knowledge Discovery; Machine Learning; data mining; human; knowledge discovery; machine learning; procedures","","","","","","","Aizawa T., Decomposition of improvements in infant mortality in asian developing countries over three decades, Demography, 58, 1, pp. 137-163, (2021); Akaike H., On the Entropy Maximization Principle” in P, Applications of Statistics, (1977); Anand S.S., Buchner A.G., Decision Support through Data Mining, (1998); Anyadike-Danes M., McVicar D., My brilliant career: characterizing the early labor market trajectories of British women from generation X, Socio.

The authors use data from the General Social Survey (N = 57,224) to estimate the historical trajectory of U.S. attitudes about women in politics, familial roles, and working motherhood. Of all attitudes analyzed, Americans hold the most liberal attitudes toward women in politics, with no gender gap and little educational difference on this issue. Attitudes toward familial roles have the largest educational gap but a small gender difference. The gender gap in attitudes toward working motherhood has persisted over time, with women holding more egalitarian attitudes than men. The educational disparity on this issue disappeared during the mid-1990s “stalled gender revolution” but has widened since. Although the “stall” occurred among all gender and educational groups on all four gender attitude measures, the decline was starkest among the college educated regarding working motherhood. © SAGE Publications Inc..

It uses the most currently available population series from the 1995, 2001 and 2007 World Value Surveys of 4500 respondents and a series of multilevel cross-classified models to properly estimate period and cohort effects. Attitudes toward women's dual roles manifest neither period nor cohort effects; the population displays a universal high level of acceptance of women's paid employment. Orientations toward gender equality manifest both cohort and period effects: members of the youngest cohort of both sexes hold the most liberal attitudes; the positive effect of college education has increased over time. Attitude toward gender equality in China displays neither a shift toward conservatism nor an over-time trend toward egalitarianism in 1995-2007, a time of rapid economic growth. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","China; Cohort; Dual roles; Gender attitudes; Gender equality; Period","","","","","","University of California, Davis","We thank Diane Felmlee, Mary Jackman, and anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions.

We analyze a 1995 national survey of urban China (10,967 individuals in 55 cities) and city-level data compiled from Chinese statistical yearbooks to show intercity covariations between an index of marketization and a set of indicators of gender inequality in the labor markets. Our analysis shows gender gaps in human capital, political capital, labor market placement, and work earnings. Most of these gender inequalities remain constant across cities of varying degrees of product, labor, and capital marketization. To the extent that the amount of gender inequality is correlated with marketization, this association is a non-monotonic one, indicating a nonlinear, accumulative marketization process. Major changes have taken place in the most marketized cities, where the gender disparity in affiliation with the state sector has diminished and gender-based occupational segregation has been on the rise. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Bian Y., Work and inequality in urban China, (1994); Bian Y., Chinese Social Stratification and Social Mobility, Annual Review of Sociology, 28, pp. 91-116, (2002); Bian Y., Li Y., Social Network Capital of Urban Chinese Families, Hsinghua Sociological Review, 2, pp. 1-14, (2000); Bian Y., Logan J.R., Market Transition and the Persistence of Power: The Changing Stratification System in Urban China, American Sociological Review, 61, pp. 739-758, (1996); Bian Y., Logan J.R., Shu X., Wage and Job Inequalities in the Working Lives of Men and Women in Tianjin, Re-Drawing Boundaries: Work, Households, and Gender in China, pp. 111-133, (2000); Bian Y., Shu X., Logan J.R., Communist Party Membership and Regime Dynamics in China, Social Forces, 79, pp. 805-841, (2001); Bian Y., Zhang Z., Marketization, Segmentation, and Income in Urban China: 1988 and 1995, Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, (2002); China State Statistical Bureau, China Statistical Yearbook, (1998); Davis D., Inequality and Stratification in the Nineties, China Review, 11, pp. 1-5, (1995); Davis D.S., Social Class Transformation in Urban China: Training, Hiring, and Promoting Urban Professionals and Managers after 1949, Modern China, 26, pp. 251-275, (2000); Entwisle B., Henderson G.E., Short S.E., Bouma J., Fengying Z., Gender and Family Businesses in Rural China, American Sociological Review, 26, pp. 251-275, (1995); Goldstein H.I., Multilevel Models in Education and Social Research, (1986); Hauser S., Xie Y., Temporal and Regional Variation in Earnings Inequality: Urban China in Transition between 1988 and 1995, Paper presented at the International Sociological Association RC28 Conference, Berkeley, CA, (2001); Hershatter G., Local Meanings of Gender and Work in Rural Shaanxi in the 1950s, Redrawing Boundaries: Work, Households, and Gender in China, pp. 79-96, (2000); Honig E., Hershatter G., Personal Voices: Chinese Women in the 1980s, (1988); Honig E., Iron Girls Revisited: Gender and the Politics of Work in the Cultural Revolution: 1966–76, Redrawing Boundaries: Work, Households, and Gender in China, pp. 97-110, (2000); Joreskog K.G., Sorbom D., LISREL VII: A Guide to the Program and Applications, (1988); Joreskog K.G., Sorbom D., LISREL VIII: Structural Equation Modeling with the SIMPLIS Command Language, (1993); Lavely W., Zhenyu X., Bohua L., Freeman R., The Rise in Female Education in China: National and Regional Patterns, China Quarterly, 121, pp. 61-93, (1990); Lee C.K., Engendering the Worlds of Labor: Women Workers, Labor Markets, and Production Politics in the South China Economic Miracle, American Sociological Review, 60, pp. 378-397, (1995); Li B., Walder A.G., Career Advancement as Party Patronage.

Background: We argue that societies do not experience universal, unidirectional progress toward nontraditional gender attitudes. The distribution of global attitudes toward horizontal and vertical gender differentiation displays uneven patterns across nations. Method: Using data from the World Values Surveys (N = 72,304) and employing machine learning, multilevel linear models, and multilevel multinomial models to analyze individual- and country-level influences. Results: We mapped gender ideologies globally by classifying individuals into four domains of ideological space—three varieties of egalitarianism: liberal egalitarian, egalitarian essentialist, and flexible traditionalist values, and one traditional ideology of traditional essentialist. Conclusions: The liberal egalitarian gender ideology was widespread globally including in Muslim-majority countries, and country characteristics correlated with gender ideologies in divergent ways. Female labor force participation was associated with three nontraditional ideologies that are progressive at least on one dimension. Economic development was linked with liberal egalitarian and egalitarian essentialist attitudes, both supporting gender equality. Generous public-funded parental leave policies correlated with flexible traditionalist ideology that buttressed women's dual roles but not gender equality. Implications: These results demonstrated an uneven societal transition in gender attitudes globally. Global gender ideologies charted three divergent trajectories toward multiple forms of non-traditionalism. Although people in social democratic welfare states, liberal and conservative welfare states, former socialist countries, and Muslim-majority countries occupied four distinct domains of gender ideology, different nation-states were not monoliths conforming to the prevailing ideologies of their societies. © 2024 The Author(s).

We argue that political screening is a persistent feature and a survival strategy of all Communist parties and that the mechanisms of ensuring political screening are affected by the regime's agendas in different historical periods. Using data from surveys conducted in Shanghai and Tianjin in 1993, we found that measures of political screening were persistently significant predictors of party membership attainment in all post-1949 periods and that party membership is positively associated with mobility into positions of political and managerial authority during the post-1978 reform era. Education emerged to be a significant predictor of Communist party membership in the post-1978 period. These findings indicate that China has made historical shifts to recruit among the educated to create a technocratic elite that is both occupationally competent and politically screened. © 2001 University of North Carolina Press.","","","","","","","University ofMinnesota; National Science Foundation, NSF, (SES-9209214); National Science Foundation, NSF","*An earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, San Francisco, August 21-25, 1998.

People often meet romantic partners and friends through other friends, acquaintances, and family members. They also are more likely to develop those relationships that are approved of by family and friends, and that are linked with existing social connections, than those that exist in isolation from social networks (Schmeeckle & Sprecher, 2004; Sprecher, Felmlee, Orbuch, & Willetts, 2002). Although the social network literature has focused on how social networks propel relationships forward toward greater intimacy (e.g., Sprecher & Felmlee, 1992), the more neglected side of this literature is that social networks also play a role in the termination of relationships. Two people may explore the possibility of a relationship with each other but never officially start dating (i.e., they end their “relationship”) because their network members express disapproval of their relationship. Furthermore, couples that progress to an intimate partnership or marriage may later dissolve their relationship, in part because they are encouraged by friends and family to break up or because the network provides an alternative relationship. © 2006 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Acitelli L.K., Gender differences in relationship awareness and marital satisfaction among young married couples, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 18, pp. 102-110, (1992); Agnew C.R., Loving T.J., Drigotas S.M., Substituting the forest for the trees: Social networks and the prediction of romantic relationship state and fate, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, pp. 1042-1057, (2001); Albeck S., Kaydar D., Divorced mothers: Their network of friends pre- and post-divorce, Journal of Divorce and Remarriage, 36, pp. 111-138, (2002); Beals K.P., Peplau L.A., Conceptualizing and measuring the disclosure of sexual orientation, Poster presented at the International Conference on Personal Relationships, (2002); Berger C.R., Uncertainty and information exchange in developing relationships, Handbook of personal relationships: Theory, research, and interventions, pp. 239-256, (1988); Berscheid E., The greening of relationship science, American Psychologist, 54, pp. 260-266, (1999); Berscheid E., Campbell B., The changing longevity of heterosexual close relationships: A commentary and forecast, The justice motive in social behavior, pp. 209-234, (1981); Berscheid E., Graziano W., The initiation of social relationships and interpersonal attraction, Social exchange in developing relationships, pp. 31-60, (1979); Berscheid E., Lopes J., A temporal model of relationship satisfaction and stability, Satisfaction in close relationships, pp. 129-159, (1997); Berscheid E., Reis H.T., Attraction and close relationships, The handbook of social psychology, 2, pp. 193-281, (1998); Blood R.O., Love match and arranged marriage: A Tokyo-Detroit comparison, (1967); Bryant C.M., Conger R.D., Marital success and domains of social support in long-term relationships: Does the influence of network members ever end?, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 61, pp. 437-450, (1999); Burns A., Perceived causes of marriage breakdown and conditions of life, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 46, pp. 551-562, (1984); Cagen S., Quirkyalone: A manifesto for uncompromising romantics, (2004); Cate R.M., Levin L.A., Richmond L.S., Premarital relationship stability: A review of recent research, Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 19, pp. 261-284, (2002); Cate R.M., Sprecher S., Commitment in dating and engaged/married couples: A contextual analysis, (2005); Cheal D., Sociology of family life, (2002); Clark-Ibanez M., Felmlee D., Interethnic relationships: The role of social network diversity, Journal of Marriage and Family, 66, pp. 293-305, (2004); Cleek M., Pearson T.A., Perceived causes of divorce: An analysis of interrelationships, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 47, pp. 179-191, (1985); Driscoll R., Davis K.E., Lipetz M.E., Parental interference and romantic love: The Romeo and Juliet effect, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 24, pp. 1-10, (1972); Duck S., A topography of relationship disengagement and dissolution, Personal relationships: Vol. 4.

It argues that the significance of economic globalization on gender inequality depends on its impact on job queues in the labor market of a country. Using both individual- and city-level data, and a series of multilevel linear and logistic models, we analyze the effects of three city-level variables on the gender gap in income: foreign direct investment (FDI) per capita, growth rate of FDI, and opening up to overseas investment early on. We also examine gender differences in employment in high-paying foreign-invested firms, and in lower-paying export-oriented manufacturing. We find no variation in gender gap in income among cities of varying levels of FDI, growth rates of FDI, or whether they were among the earliest to open up to international investment. Women are more likely to be employed in export-oriented manufacturing industries that offer lower wages and are less likely to work in high-paying foreign firms and joint ventures. These results suggest that economic globalization profoundly influences gender inequalities by changing the nature of job queues, and men and women are sorted and matched into jobs accordingly. Economic globalization contributed to and perpetuated a gendered distribution of male and female workers in the Chinese urban labor market in the late 1990s. © 2007 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.","","","","","","","","","Alder N.J., Izraeli D.N., Competitive Frontiers: Women Managers in A Global Economy., (1994); (2000); Barnet R., Cavanaugh J., Global Dreams: Imperial Corporations and the New World Order., (1994); Becker G., The Economics of Discrimination., (1959); Unequal Burden: Economic Crises, Persistent Poverty, and Women's Work., (1992); Berik G., Nature Export-Led Growth and Gender Wage Inequality in Taiwan, Feminist Economics, 6, pp. 1-26, (2000); Gunseli B., Van De Meulen Rodgers Y., Zveglich Jr. J.E., International Trade and Gender Wage Discrimination: Evidence from East Asian, Review of Development Economics, 8, pp. 237-54, (2004); Braunstein E., (2006); Brinton M.C., Women's Working Lives in East Asia., (2001); Cohen P., Wang F., (2006); Dempster A.P., Laird N.M., Rubin D.B., Maximum Likelihood from Incomplete Data via the em Algorithm, Journal of the Royal Statistical Association, 76, pp. 341-53, (1977); Dollar D., Gatti R., (1999); Fernandez-Kelly P., For We Are Sold, Me and My People: Women and Industry in Mexico's Frontier., (1983); Fields G., Industrialization and Employment in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, Foreign Trade and Investment: Economic Development in the Newly Industrializing Asian Countries., pp. 333-75, (1985); Galenson W., Labor and Economic Growth in Five Asian Countries: South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines., (1992); Goldstein H.I., Multilevel Models in Education and Social Research., (1987); Gothaskar S., Computerization and Women's Employment in India's Banking Sector, Women Encounter Technology: Changing Patterns of Employment in the Third World., pp. 150-77, (1995); Greenhalgh S., Sex Stratification in East Asia: The Other Side of 'Growth with Equity., Population and Development Review, 11, pp. 265-314, (1985); Greider W., One World, Ready or Not: The Magic Logic of Global Capitalism., (1997); Guthrie D., China and Globalization: The Social, Economic, and Political Transformation of Chinese Society., (2006); Hsiung P.-Chun., Living Rooms As Factories: Class, Gender, and the Satellite Factory System in Taiwan., (1996); Joekes S., Weston A., Women and the New Trade Agenda., (1994); Kim S.-Kyung., Class Struggle or Family Struggle?

Education influences gender attitudes in multiple ways at both the micro- and macrolevels. Better-educated individuals hold more egalitarian gender attitudes, and this positive effect of individual education is larger for women than for men, indicating a strong empowerment effect for women. Egalitarian gender attitudes trickle down through education, as individuals in communities with high education are socialized toward more egalitarian attitudes. Community education has a larger effect toward the egalitarian direction on the attitude toward the importance of having sons than on the attitude toward women's marriage rights, indicating that change in the latter attitude occurred earlier and has now spread via education. These findings show that education is a vehicle of socialization that is used by both the domestic power elite (the Communist Party) and the Western culture.","","","","","","","Institute of Governmental Affairs","The author thanks Yanjie Bian, Diane Felmlee, Mary Jackman, and Dina Okamoto for their helpful comments on this article.

We test these questions on 20 waves of data from the General Social Survey, 1977-2016 (N = 45,125). Compositional change in individual characteristics accounts for almost 78 percent of the cohort variation in gender attitudes, but only 32 percent of the historical transformations. Macro dynamics are responsible for an additional 60 percent of the historical change in gender attitudes. Two structural forces are associated with historical transitions in American gender attitudes: gender equality in the labor force and the rise of men's overwork. Each of these factors accounts for a significant proportion of the period variation in gender attitudes in our analysis, and the rise of men's overwork appears to account for the puzzle of the ""stalled revolution"" in the 1990s and its ""restart"" in the mid-2000s. The conservative swing in 1994-2004 correlates with the rise of overwork, as the proportion of men who overwork soared during this period when traditional gender roles were reinforced. © The Author(s) 2017.

The authors analyze mundane, child-related, and economic decisions using data from a 2000 national sample of 8,300 married urban individuals from 178 cities. Gender ideology and gendered patterns of inequality remain the most salient determinants of marital decision-making power. Specialization in housework bestows power on wives in mundane and child-related decisions and extends the existing pattern of gendered specialization in housework and breadwinning into wives' prevalence in mundane decisions and husbands' dominance in economic decisions. There is little support for resource theory: wives fail to use their relative income to bargain for more power. Housework, not relative income, boosts Chinese wives' marital decision-making power in mundane and child-related decisions, indicating the absence of a ""transitional equalitarian"" value system and a collective rather than an individualistic orientation in marital power process. © The Author(s) 2012.","China; marital power; patriarchy; relative resources; specialization","","","","","","","","Becker G.S., Human Capital, (1964); Becker G.S., A Treatise on the Family, (1981); Berk S.F., The Gender Factory: The Apportionment of Work in American Households, (1985); Bittman M., England P., Sayer L., Folbre N., Matheson G., When does gender trumps money?

We analyze change in the gender gap in human capital, political capital, labor-force placement, and family structure; change in the amount of monetary return to these determinants; and the changing significance of these sources of influence. We do so by analyzing two national samples from the 1988 and 1995 Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) and city-level data for 1995. We found no longitudinal change nor city-level variation in the gender gap in earnings. Despite this stability, the proportion of the gender gap in earnings attributable to education and occupational segregation increased over time. This change is disproportional, occurring largely only in the most marketized cities. In these highly marketized cities, the significance of market-related mechanisms -education and occupation and industry-placement - has increased, while the contribution of redistribution-related mechanisms - affiliation with the state sector, party membership, and seniority - has decreased. These changes indicate that the Chinese market transition is a nonlinear, cumulative process.","","","","","","","","","Aldrich M., Buchele R., The Economics of Comparable Worth, (1986); Backer G., Human Capital. 2d Ed., (1975);

Using seven waves of national data from the 2003–2013 Chinese General Social Surveys (N = 43,308), we estimate the effects of cohort size on socio-economic status and subjective evaluation of life. Members of large birth cohort suffer from their birth times; cohort size is negatively associated with family income and happiness. We further identify the impact of a confounding historical event, the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), on the cohorts coming of age in those times. Three cohorts (born in 1947–1966) who came of age during the Cultural Revolution fare the worst in objective and subjective well-being. This negative cohort effect is partly due to their large cohort size. Although born during the temporary low-birth period of the Great Famine (1958–1961), children of early Cultural Revolution fare the worst in human and political capital attainment, family income, and sense of subjective well-being. We speculated that they were also subject to the intense population-based competition in schooling and employment. © 2023 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

We use a life-course perspective to examine change in prestige, education, earning potential, and sex type dimensions in occupational aspirations in the U.S., using longitudinal data on cohorts of young people ages 14-29 during the period between 1966 and 1980. After their initial formation in childhood and adolescence, occupational aspirations are regulated by experiences in the educational system, the labor market, and for women, the adult family. The Civil Rights and the Women's Movements contributed to age-, cohort-, and period-related increases in women and black men's occupational aspirations. The economic downturn after 1973 also played a role, reducing young men's occupational aspirations and reverting black men's aspirations to the same level as that prior to the 1970s, negating the positive influences of the Civil Rights Movement. There is no evidence that the Vietnam War produced a net change in young people's aspirations. These findings show that after their initial formation under ascriptive influences, occupational aspirations continue to evolve as new life experiences associated with changed societal values and opportunity structure provide impetus for change. Despite these perturbations, socioeconomic background, race, and gender retain a pervasive impact on the regulation of young people's aspirations in adolescent and young adulthood in the United States. © 2007 International Sociological Association Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility.","Age-cohort-period effects; Civil Rights Movement; Labor market; Life course; Occupational aspirations; Women's Movement","","","","","","Graduate School of the University of Minnesota; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; University of California, Davis","We thank Diane Felmlee, Mary Jackman, Monica Kirkpatrick Johnson and Bill McCarthy for their helpful comments.

During this period, the change in occupational aspirations was gender related, occuring primarily among women. Because this change preceded significant change in the distribution of women in the occupational structure, the authors argue that it was primarily a manifestation of cultural change resulting from the resurgence of the women's movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Gender-related change in occupational aspirations occurred broadly across social classes and racial groups, although it was greater among those whose parents were highly educated. As a result, the effect of parental socioeconomic status on the earning potential and sex type of occupational aspirations increased for women during the period studied.","","","","","","","","","Bachman J.G., O'Malley P.M., Johnston J., Adolescence to Adulthood: Change and Stability in the Lives of Young Men, (1978); Beller A.H., Trends in occupational segregation by sex and race, 1960-1981, Sex Segregation in the Workplace: Trends, Explanations, Remedies, pp. 11-26, (1984); Bianchi S.M., Rytina N., The decline in occupational sex segregation during the 1970s: Census and CPS comparisons, Demography, 23, pp. 79-86, (1986); Bianchi S.M., Spain D., American Women in Transition, (1986); Bielby D.D.V., Career sex-atypicality and career involvement of college educated women: Baseline evidence from the 1960's, Sociology of Education, 51, pp. 7-28, (1978); Blake J., Family size and the quality of children, Demography, 18, pp. 421-442, (1981); Family Size and Achievement, (1989); Cherlin A.J., Marriage, Divorce, Remarriage (Rev.

Structural equation models are estimated using data at two time points from the Iowa Youth and Families Project (N = 227 friendship pairs). Results suggest that the lives of adolescents and both their mother and father are inexorably linked. Observed interactions with a close friend at Time 2 reveal teens recreate their parents’ original hostile, supportive, and problem-solving styles from Time 1. This outcome depends on (a) type of behavior and (b) gender. Mothers’ supportive behavior, fathers’ problem solving, and both parents’ hostile behavior significantly influence adolescents’ comparable interaction styles. Adolescents’ subsequent behavior toward their friend significantly affects friendship quality. Lower levels of hostile behavior in female youth, increased problem solving by males, and supportive actions toward a friend for both relate positively to rewarding friendships. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","adolescents; dyadic relationship/quality/satisfaction; family processes; father–child relationship; friendship; gender and family; life course; mother–child relationship; peer relationships; quantitative","","","","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (MH00567, MH19734, MH43270, MH48165, MH5136, MH51361); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (DA05347, HD047573); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; John D. and Catherine T.

Such measures are needed for cohort or other temporal comparisons employing data coded according to the 1960, 1970, and 1980 detailed occupational classifications and to merge DOT variables with micro-level data sets where occupation is coded using the 1960 detailed classification. We describe procedures used to reconcile the 1960 and 1970 detailed occupational classifications from information currently available and to compute measures of DOT variables for the 1960 classification from measures of DOT variables available for the 1970 classification. We then use confirmatory factor analysis to create summary indices of occupational characteristics for the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Census detailed occupational classification. We hypothesize a factor structure based on substantive conceptual criteria and test this hypothesized structure by estimating a series of modified and nested models. Our analysis produces measures of six occupational characteristics: substantive complexity, motor skill, physical perception, social skill, physical demands, and working conditions. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.","","","","","","","College of Liberal Arts and the Graduate School of the University of Minnesota; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01-HD27598); National Institute on Aging, NIA; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This is a revised version of a paper presented at the Population Association of America Annual Meeting, Miami Beach, Florida, May, 1994.

This article analyzes the impact of the new form of economic segmentation, which emerged in urban China during the market transition, on gender segregation and earnings differentials. Methods. I compare both over-time and across-city change in gender segregation, and use a series of multi-level crossclassified models based on data at three levels: a 1995 national sample of individual workers, industry-sector data for 1990 and 1995, and city-level data for 1995. Results. Gender segregation by ownership sector has declined over time now that the state sector has become differentiated and its relative economic advantages wanes. Both earnings differentiation and gender segregation among industries have increased with marketization. In the most marketized cities, the earnings of workers of both sexes in jobs with high rates of female entry are penalized, indicating that marketization exacerbated die negative effect of job feminization on earnings. Conclusions. These findings lend support for the ""queuing"" perspective that a decline in jobs' relative wages leads to feminization. The making of the Chinese market economy has created a new set of institutional arrangements, which includes that between job feminization and wages. © 2005 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.","","","","","","","","","Bian Y., Work and Inequality in Urban China, (1994);

We use cross-classified multilevel models and repeated measures of happiness from seven waves of the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS 2003–2013, N = 43,308). The results indicate that individuals born between 1956 and 1961 experienced setbacks at various pivotal moments throughout their life, including education, employment, economic stability, and social connections, and this cohort reports a lower overall sense of happiness when compared to other cohorts. The effect of aging on happiness comprises a U-shaped pattern; the middle-aged are the least happy. We observe an upward trend in happiness from 2003 to 2013. These results are confirmed by using subjective socioeconomic status (SES) as an alternative measure of well-being from CGSS 2003 and CGSS 2005 (N = 11,992). This paper contributes to studies of market transition by identifying the birth cohort as an important mechanism of inequality. It also augments the life-course paradigm by highlighting the significance of timing when individual lives intersect with historical context. © The Author(s) 2023.","China; inequality; mobility; quantitative methods; social change","","","","","","University of California, Davis, UCD","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by Faculty Research Grant from the Academic Senate of the University of California, Davis.

Yet, we don’t know if this is due to their large cohort size negatively affecting happiness. We question whether people born in high fertility times are unhappy because they suffer more from economic setbacks and/or social strains. Using 9 waves of data from the European Social Survey United Kingdom Subset 2002–2018 (N = 19,364) and hierarchical age-period-cohort cross-classified models, we analyze the effects of cohort size, socioeconomic status, marital status, and sociality on happiness. Cohort size, marital status, and sociality are the top three factors of cohort difference in happiness, but socioeconomic status is not. Cohort size is negatively associated with happiness. Income, education, or employment are not the source of unhappiness among the Boomers. Besides being members of a large cohort, the Boomers have two known factors against their odds: they are the most likely to separate and divorce and the least likely to socialize with friends despite having a large number of peers. Social disintegration and deprivation, not economic impoverishment, appears to be the culprit of unhappiness of the UK Baby Boomers. © 2022, The Author(s).","Baby boomers; Cohort analysis; Easterlin hypothesis; Happiness","article; baby boomer; cohort analysis; controlled study; divorce; education; female; friend; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; marriage; social status; unhappiness; United Kingdom","","","","","University of California, Davis, UCD; Department of Sociology, University of Alabama at Birmingham","Funding for this research was provided by Small Research Grant from the Department of Sociology at UC Davis to the first author.

We analyze and characterize the global telecommunication network and test a series of hypotheses on the relationship between gender values and three types of telephone connections: ties with the global society, ties with Western nations, and ties within groups of nations sharing similar cultural, religious, political, or geographical traits. We use multilevel models and data on two levels, between-country telecommunications network data from TeleGeography, and individual-level data (N = 70,225) on people living in 47 countries from the World Value Survey, waves III and IV. Countries with high degrees of communication insulation, measured as a high percentage of within-group ties of all global telephone links, hold less egalitarian attitudes toward gender equality. This negative effect of group insulation depresses the egalitarian effects of younger birth cohort, college education, and higher income. Embeddedness in a localized information diffusion network and isolated from global communication is associated with less egalitarian attitude toward gender equality.
