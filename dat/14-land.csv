Paradoxically, many genetic variants that have been associated with increased risks of such diseases are found in genomes of long-lived people, and do not seem to compromise longevity. Here we argue that trade-off-like and conditional effects of genes can play central role in this phenomenon and in determining longevity. Such effects may occur as result of: (i) antagonistic influence of gene on the development of different health disorders; (ii) change in the effect of gene on vulnerability to death with age (especially, from “bad” to “good”); (iii) gene–gene interaction; and (iv) gene–environment interaction, among other factors. A review of current knowledge provides many examples of genetic factors that may increase the risk of one disease but reduce chances of developing another serious health condition, or improve survival from it. Factors that may increase risk of a major disease but attenuate manifestation of physical senescence are also discussed. Overall, available evidence suggests that the influence of a genetic variant on longevity may be negative, neutral or positive, depending on a delicate balance of the detrimental and beneficial effects of such variant on multiple health and aging related traits. This balance may change with age, internal and external environments, and depend on genetic surrounding. We conclude that trade-off-like and conditional genetic effects are very common and may result in situations when a disease “risk allele” can also be a pro-longevity variant, depending on context. We emphasize importance of considering such effects in both aging research and disease prevention. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Age-specific influence; Aging; Complex disease; Conditional effects; Epistasis; Genetic risk factors; Gene–environment interaction; Longevity; Physical senescence; Trade-offs","Age Distribution; Aging; Alleles; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Humans; Longevity; Models, Genetic; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; apolipoprotein; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; protein p53; aging; Alzheimer disease; APOE gene; cardiovascular disease; CTLA 4 gene; diabetes mellitus; epistasis; FOXO1A gene; FOXO3A gene; gene; gene frequency; gene function; gene identification; gene interaction; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype environment interaction; heredity; heterozygote; human; lifespan; longevity; mortality; MTHFR gene; nonhuman; NRDE2 gene; PAI 1 gene; priority journal; Review; senescence; TP53 gene; vulnerable population; age distribution; allele; biological model; epidemiology; gene frequency; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; longevity; risk factor; survival rate","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG043352, P30AG034424, R01AG046860); National Institute on Aging, NIA","The research reported in this publication was in part supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health grants R01AG046860, P01AG043352.

However, not all nations shared this trend. Despite disparate homicide patterns, researchers usually examine the average effect of correlates on homicide, potentially obscuring the impact of heterogeneity within large samples. The current study addresses this implicit homogeneity assumption by identifying three distinct latent trajectory groups of homicide trends among 77 nations from 1989 to 2010. To examine differences in the correlates of homicide trends, we analyse the impact of demographic and economic influences on homicide rates in separate fixed-effects panel regression analyses for each trajectory group as well as for the overall sample. We find that demographic and economic forces impact homicide rates differently across subsets of nations. Our findings suggest that universal explanations of 1990s cross-national homicide trends are misleading, as the same set of factors influence homicide rates differently across national contexts. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crime decline; crime trends; cross-national; homicide; latent trajectories","","","","","","","","Allison P.D., Missing Data, (2002); Ayres I., Donohue III J.J., Shooting down the “More Guns, Less Crime” Hypothesis, Stanford Law Review, 55, 4, pp. 1193-1312, (2002); Baumer E.P., An Empirical Assessment of the Contemporary Crime Trend Puzzle: A Modest Step to A More Comprehensive Research Agenda, Understanding Crime Trends: Workshop Report, pp. 127-176, (2008); Baumer E.P., Wolff K.T., The Breadth and Causes of Contemporary Cross-national Homicide Trends, Crime and Justice, 43, 1, pp. 231-287, (2014); Baumer E.P., Velez M.B., Rosenfeld R., Bringing Crime Trends Back into Criminology: A Critical Assessment of the Literature and A Blueprint for Future Inquiry, Annual Review of Criminology, 1, 1, pp. 39-61, (2018); Bergman M., More Money, More Crime: Prosperity and Rising Crime in Latin America, (2018); Blumstein A., Wallman J., The Crime Drop in America, (2006); Blumstein A., Rosenfeld R., Explaining Recent Trends in U.S. Homicide Rates, The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology, 88, 4, pp. 1175-1216, (1998); Brauer J.R., McCall P.L., Social Welfare Support and Homicide: Longitudinal Analyses of European Countries from 1994 to 2010, Social Science Research, 48, 4, pp. 90-107, (2014); Buonanno P., Drago F., Galbiati R., Zanella G., Crime in Europe and the United States: Dissecting the ‘Reversal of Misfortunes’, Economic Policy, 26, 67, pp. 347-385, (2011); Chon D.S., Medical Resources and National Homicide Rates: A Cross-national Assessment, International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice, 34, 1, pp. 97-118, (2010); Chu D.C., Tusalem R.F., The Role of the State on Cross-national Homicide Rates, International Criminal Justice Review, 23, 3, pp. 252-279, (2013); Cook P.J., Laub J.H., The Unprecedented Epidemic in Youth Violence, Crime and Justice, 24, pp. 27-61, (1998); Cullen F.T., Social Support as an Organising Concept for Criminology: Presidential Address to the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, Justice Quarterly, 11, 4, pp. 527-559, (1994); Donohue J.J., Levitt S.D., The Impact of Legalised Abortion on Crime, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116, 2, pp. 379-420, (2001); Durkheim E., The Division of Labour in Society, (1984); Eisner M., Modernity Strikes Back?

On what basis can the public and its leaders form opinions and draw conclusions? We noted that the specific aspect of these and related questions to which the book is addressed is obtaining a sense of the overall direction of changes in child well-being over time and across social space in the United States in the presence of many possible indicators and reports from studies that do not always give consistent information.

There are many statistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal data, which is one of the most prolific areas of statistical science. The goal of this chapter is to provide a brief discussion of approaches to statistical analysis of longitudinal data on aging relevant to the major topic of this book, Biodemography of Aging, and relate this discussion to the subsequent chapters in Part II of the monograph. We focus on statistical methods aimed at analyses of time-to-event data jointly with longitudinal measurements that have become known in the mainstream biostatistical literature as “joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data” or simply “joint models.” We briefly present the basics of joint models and their various extensions suggested in the recent biostatistical literature and discuss them in the context of biodemographic applications. We mention stochastic process models in the context of biodemographic analyses of mechanisms and regularities of aging in relation to mortality and morbidity risks. These models will be discussed in detail in Chap. 12 of this monograph. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Baseline Hazard; Hazard Rate; Joint Model; Longitudinal Data; Longitudinal Outcome","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P01AG043352, P30AG034424, R01AG030198, R01AG030612, R01AG032319, R01AG046860); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA","Acknowledgements This chapter was partly supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under Award Numbers R01AG030198, R01AG032319, R01AG030612, R01AG046860, P01AG043352, and P30AG034424.

Yet grouping or right-censoring decisions of count responses still rely on arbitrary choices made by researchers. We develop a new method for evaluating grouping and right-censoring decisions of count responses from a (semisupervised) machine-learning perspective. This article uses Poisson multinomial mixture models to conceptualize the data-generating process of count responses with grouping and right censoring and demonstrates the link between grouping-scheme choices and asymptotic distributions of the Poisson mixture. To search for the optimal grouping scheme maximizing objective functions of the Fisher information (matrix), an innovative three-step M algorithm is then proposed to process infinitely many grouping schemes based on Bayesian A-, D-, and E-optimalities. A new R package is developed to implement this algorithm and evaluate grouping schemes of count responses. Results show that an optimal grouping scheme not only leads to a more efficient sampling design but also outperforms a nonoptimal one even if the latter has more groups. © The Author(s) 2018.","experimental design; fisher information; machine learning; optimality; poisson distribution; right censoring; search algorithm; survey methodology; zero inflation","","","","","","National Social Sciences Foundation in China, (15ZDB172); University of British Columbia, Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange; American Sociological Association, ASA; Victoria University, VU; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (PolyU 25301115); Shanghai University, SHU","The authors would like to thank Junhui Wang, Jiahua Chen, Sayan Mukherjee, Li Ma, Ding-Xuan Zhou, Tim Liao, Zheng Wu, Nan Lin, Linda K.

Using National Health Interview Survey data on self-reported health, we find that disparities in men's health increased, while those of women decreased, for the whole period. Widening men's health disparities are largely driven by increases in the effects of SES-demographic statuses on within-group disparities. These increases are moderated by increasing levels of men's college attainment. But decreasing middle and upper income attainment and a decreasing employment rate further increase men's health disparities. For women, the effects of SES-demographic statuses on health disparities also increased over time. This, however, was outweighed by increases in women's college attainment, middle and upper income attainment, and employment rate. The result is overall declining self-reported health disparities for women. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Between-group disparities; Compositional effects; Demographic decomposition; Gender; Health disparities; Self-reported health; SES-demographic effects; Variance function regression; Within-group disparities","","","","","","","","Adler N.E., Newman K., Socioeconomic disparities in health: pathways and policies, Health Affairs, 21, 2, pp. 60-76, (2002); Aitkin M., Modeling variance heterogeneity in normal regression using GLIM, Applied Statistics, 36, pp. 332-339, (1987); Blau F.D., Kahn L.M., International differences in male wage inequality: institutions versus market forces, Journal of Political Economy, 104, pp. 791-837, (1996); Bosworth H.B., Siegler I.C., Brummett B.H., Et al., The association between self-rated health and mortality in a well-characterized sample of coronary artery disease patients, Medical Care, 37, pp. 1226-1236, (1999); Buchmann C., DiPrete T.A., The growing female advantage in college completion: the role of family background and academic achievement, American Sociological Review, 71, 4, pp. 515-541, (2006); Case A., Paxson C., Sex difference in morbidity and mortality, Demography, 42, pp. 189-214, (2005); Crimmins E.M., Saito Y., Trends in healthy life expectancy in the United States, 1970-1990: gender, racial, and educational differences, Social Science and Medicine, 52, pp. 1629-1641, (2001); DiNardo J., Fortin N.M., Lemieux T., Labor market institutions and the distribution of wages, 1973-1992, Econometrica, 64, pp. 1001-1044, (1996); DiPrete T.A., Buchmann C., Gender-specific trends in the value of education and the emerging gender gap in college completion, Demography, 43, 1, pp. 1-24, (2006); Farmer M.M., Ferraro K.F., Are racial disparities in health conditional on socioeconomic status?, Social Science & Medicine, 60, pp. 191-204, (2005); Feldman J.J., Makuc D.M., Kleinman J.C., Cornoni-Huntley J., National trends in educational differences in mortality, American Journal of Epidemiology, 129, 5, pp. 919-933, (1989); Freeman R.B., How much has deunionization contributed to male earnings inequality, Uneven Tides: Rising Inequality in America, pp. 133-163, (1993); George L.K., Socioeconomic status and health across the life course: progress and prospects, Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 60 B, SPECIAL ISSUE, pp. 135-139, (2005); Glied S., Lleras-Muney A., Technological Innovation and Inequality in Health, Demography, 45, 3, pp. 741-761, (2008); Goesling B., The rising significance of education for health?, Social Forces, 85, 4, pp. 1621-1644, (2007); Hamil-Luker J., Women's wages: cohort differences in returns to education and training over time, Social Science Quarterly, 86, pp. 1261-1780, (2005); Hellevik O., Linear versus logistic regression when the dependent variable is a dichotomy, Quality and Quantity, 43, pp. 59-74, (2009); Hummer R.A., Rogers R.G., Eberstein I.W., Sociodemographic approaches to differentials in adult mortality: a review of analytic approaches, Population and Development Review, 24, 3, pp. 553-578, (1998); Iachine I.A., Holm N.V., Harris J.R., Et al., How heritable is individual susceptibility to death?

This article commences by describing and giving examples of empirical applications of four methods of forecasting that have been developed, and are widely used, in the social sciences: leading indicators, quantitative trend analysis, formal forecasting models, and qualitative (theoretical""institutional""scenario) analysis and forecasts. This is followed by a section on limitations of forecasting. All social science forecasts are subject to deterioration of their accuracy with increasing temporal distance from the initiation point of the forecasts. This is due to the complexity of social systems to which forecasting models and the data from which they are estimated are only an approximation, the evolving nature of such systems, and the fact that the forecasts sometimes are just elements in the social system to which some actors respond, thus changing their behavior. It is concluded that forecasts should incorporate prediction intervals that grow with increases in the forecast horizon and the forecasts should be updated frequently. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply an integrated hierarchical age-period-cohort—variance function regression model to data from the human mortality database. We find increasing variation of the single-year rates within broader age intervals over the life course for all countries, but the increasing variation slows down at age 90 and then increases again after age 100 for some countries; the variation significantly declined across cohorts born after the early 20th century; and the variation continuously declined over much of the last two centuries but has substantially increased since 1980. Our further analysis finds the recent increases in mortality variation are not due to increasing proportions of older adults in the population, trends in mortality rates, or disproportionate delays in deaths from degenerative and man-made diseases, but rather due to increasing variations in young and middle-age adults. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Aging;

We hypothesize that differential degrees of institutional engagement-youths with ties to mainstream social institutions such as school, work or the military on one end of the spectrum and youths without such bonds on the other end-account for the direction of the relationship between homicide rates and age structure (high crime prone ages, such as 15-29). Methods: Cross sectional, Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses using robust standard errors are conducted using large samples of cities characterized by varying degrees of youths' differential institutional engagement for the years 1980, 1990 and 2000. The concept is operationalized with the percent of the population enrolled in college and the percent of 16-19 year olds who are simultaneously not enrolled in school, not in the labor market (not in the labor force or unemployed), and not in the military. Results: Consistent and invariant results emerged. Positive effects of age structure on homicide rates are found in cities that have high percentages of disengaged youth and negative effects are found among cities characterized with high percentages of youth participating in mainstream social institutions. Conclusions: This conceptualization of differential institutional engagement explains the discrepant findings in prior studies, and the findings demonstrate the influence of these contextual effects and the nature of the age structure-crime relationship. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Age structure; Cities; Ecological study; Homicide rates","","","","","","","","Anderson E., Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City, (1999); Blalock Jr. H.M., Social Statistics: Revised, (1979); Brown E., Males M., Does age or poverty level best predict criminal arrest and homicide rates?

The availability of human longitudinal and cross-sectional data on populations of study subjects made addressing these research questions possible and stimulated the development of methodological ideas on how these data could be efficiently analyzed. Biodemographic methods of studying human aging, health, and longevity allow for integration and efficient use of data and knowledge from relevant research fields including epidemiology, genetics, sociology, gerontology, environmental sciences, population genetics, etc. This chapter provides a selective account of important historical steps in the development of this research field in which members of the present research team have participated. It also illustrates how the integration of demographic and biological knowledge and data may contribute to progress in the field.

Comparisons of projections from 1990 to 2000 using this approach with census counts in 2000 for each of the 50 states and Washington, DC show that 68.0 %, 17.0 %, 11.2 %, and 3.8 % of the absolute percentage errors are <3.0 %, 3.0 % to 4.99 %, 5.0 % to 9.99 %, and ≥10.0 %, respectively. Another analysis compares average forecast errors between the extended cohort-component approach and the still widely used classic headship-rate method, by projecting number-of-bedrooms-specific housing demands from 1990 to 2000 and then comparing those projections with census counts in 2000 for each of the 50 states and Washington, DC. The results demonstrate that, compared with the extended cohort-component approach, the headship-rate method produces substantially more serious forecast errors because it cannot project households by size while the extended cohort-component approach projects detailed household sizes. We also present illustrative household and living arrangement projections for the five decades from 2000 to 2050, with medium-, small-, and large-family scenarios for each of the 50 states; Washington, DC; six counties of southern California; and the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Among many interesting numerical outcomes of household and living arrangement projections with medium, low, and high bounds, the aging of American households over the next few decades across all states/areas is particularly striking. Finally, the limitations of the present study and potential future lines of research are discussed. © 2012 Population Association of America.","Aging of households; Cohort-component approach; Forecast errors; Household and living arrangement projections; Subnational projections","","","","","","Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research; NIH SBIR; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R03AG018647); Duke University; U.S. Census Bureau; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2CHD065563, R01HD041042); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71110107025); Peking University, PKU","The research reported in this article was mainly supported by NIA/NIH SBIR Phase I and Phase II project grants.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reached fundamentally the same conclusion by showing that traits in late life are likely controlled by a relatively large number of common genetic variants. Further, GWAS often show that the associations are of tiny effect. The primary reason for complex actions of genes on age-related traits characteristic of modern societies is the elusive role of evolution in these traits. Therefore, the complexity of gene actions on traits in late life appears to be inherent. The complexity of gene actions on traits in late life can well explain why many genetic signals appear to be weak. In this chapter, we consider several examples of complex modes of gene actions, including genetic tradeoffs, antagonistic genetic effects on the same traits at different ages, and variable genetic effects on lifespan. The analyses focus on the APOE common polymorphism. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","APOE Gene; Common Genetic Variant; Late Life; Modulate Role; Significant Protective Effect","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P01AG043352, R01AG030198, R01AG030612, R01AG032319, R01AG046860); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; Boston University, BU, (N01-HC-25195, N02-HL-64278); Boston University, BU","Acknowledgements This chapter was partly supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under Award Numbers R01AG030198, R01AG032319, R01AG030612, R01AG046860, and P01AG043352.

We propose an intuitive, effective approach to diagnosing the presence of multicollinearity and its remedies in this class of models. A simulation study demonstrates the impacts of multicollinearity on coefficient estimates, associated standard errors, and variance components at various levels of multicollinearity for finite sample sizes typical in social science studies. We further investigate the role multicollinearity plays at each level for estimation of coefficient parameters in terms of shrinkage. Based on these analyses, we recommend a top-down method for assessing multicollinearity in HLMs that first examines the contextual predictors (Level-2 in a two-level model) and then the individual predictors (Level-1) and uses the results for data collection, research problem redefinition, model re-specification, variable selection and estimation of a final model. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Covariate pool; Hierarchical linear models; Multicollinearity; Singular value decomposition; Top-down diagnosis","Humans; Linear Models; Models, Theoretical; Regression Analysis; Research Design; Social Sciences; human; methodology; procedures; regression analysis; sociology; statistical model; theoretical model","","","","","","","Belsley D.A., Kuh E., Welsch R.E., Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity, (1980); Belsley D.A., Conditioning Diagnostics: Collinearity and Weak Data in Regression, (1991); Bingham N.H., Fry J.M., Regression: Linear Models in Statistics, (2010); Bollen K.A., Structural Equations with Latent Variables, (1989); Cohen J., Cohen P., West S.G., Aiken L.S., Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (2002); Fox J., Regression Diagnostics: An Introduction, (1991); Gelman A., Hill J., Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models, (2007); Goldstein H., Multilevel Statistical Models, (2002); Greene W.H., Econometric Analysis, (2011); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., The Elements of Statistical Learning, (2009); Kleinbaum D.G., Kupper L.L., Nizam A., Muller K.E., Applied Regression Analysis and Other Multivariable Methods, (2008); Kuhn M., Johnson K., Applied Predictive Modeling, (2013); Kutner M.H., Nachtsheim C.J., Neter J., Applied Linear Regression Models, (2004); Land K.C., McCall P.L., Cohen L.E., Structural covariates of homicide rates: are there any invariances across time and social space?, Am.

The authors build upon social control and routine activities to develop a dynamic, multi-contextual criminal opportunity theory. Emphasizing the importance of contextual explanations of criminal acts, they propose two levels of analysis: individual and environmental. At each level, the theory pivots on three broad organizing constructs--offenders motivated to commit criminal acts, targets such as persons or property suitable as objects of criminal acts, and the presence or absence of individuals or other defensive mechanisms capable of serving as guardians against criminal acts. Crime is profoundly real, possessing qualities that make its occurrence and prevention pressing and persistent matters for individuals and societies. Theory, in contrast, is seen as highly abstract and removed from the seriousness of “real life.�? Theory almost seems to be a peculiar sport of an academic class. The practically minded, even some academic criminologists, are often perplexed by the seeming obsession some scholars have with theory, which, after all, is nothing more than an explanation of facts. The practically minded, seeing a compelling need to identify the crucial factors that could be used to predict and prevent crime, wonder why anyone would invest precious time and energy into speculating about the abstract, underlying details of why crime occurs when and where it does.The authors contend that every intervention, prevention, and policy is based on some theoretical explanation of the causes of human behavior. The improvement of interventions, preventions, and policies is thus directly related to the improvement of theoretical understandings of the abstract, underlying details of the causes of crime. The development of explanations of events, when properly done, is a crucial component to understanding and possibly improving the “real world.�? This work does just that. © 2003 by Taylor & Francis.

Using eight waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey from 1989 to 2009, this research conducts hierarchical age–period–cohort analyses to investigate temporal patterns of the rising overweight/obesity prevalence for children and youth aged 2–25 in the world’s most populous country. We find that the age trajectory of overweight/obesity reaches a nadir around age 14 and 15 and increases afterwards. Children and youth are more likely to be overweight/obese in the most recent period of observation, and this pattern is persistent across different socio-demographic groups. Moreover, a statistically significant cohort component is detected for the overall population and further analyses reveal that this cohort increase is mainly restricted to males. Demonstrating distinct age, period, and cohort components embedded in the rise of childhood overweight/obesity in China, this research lends support to the global epidemic of obesity and calls attention to a new phase of the Epidemiologic Transition in China. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Children and youth; China; Hierarchical age–period–cohort analyses; Obesity; Overweight","China; child health; cohort analysis; health survey; obesity; temporal analysis; weight; young population","","","","","Duke University","This is a revised version of a paper presented at the 2013 annual meetings of the American Sociological Association, August 10–13, New York, NY.

They actually provided a strong rationale for conducting more detailed analyses which require advanced methods of mathematical and statistical modeling. Development and implementation of such state-of-the-art methods is driven by two major factors. The first reflects systemic effects of various behavioral, physiological, and environmental processes on human aging and the related phenotypes. The second is that not all such processes can be readily measured and quantified in studies of human health, aging, and lifespan. In this regard, longitudinal data play a pivotal role in discovering different aspects of knowledge related to aging, health, and lifespan. A variety of statistical methods can be used to analyze longitudinal data. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Latent Structure Analysis; Lifespan Distribution; Longitudinal Data; Stochastic Process Model; Unobserved Heterogeneity","","","","","","","","","A.M.

The results showed that, if the current age distribution of rural-to-urban migrants with a high concentration of young people remains unchanged, the Middle region will have the most serious problems of population and household aging, followed by the Eastern region; population and household aging will be twice as severe in rural areas compared to urban areas in Middle and Eastern regions. Our multi-regional projections and analysis clearly showed that population and household aging problems under the current fertility policies unchanged would be much more serious than that under the two-child policy. Our study suggests that the inclusion of elderly parents in regional and rural to urban family migration, which implies co- or proximate-residence between old parents and adult children, would help to avoid the over-aging problems in rural areas and the Middle region; this strategy may result in a win-win outcome for both old and young generations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adult Child; Eastern Region; Living Arrangement; Middle Region; Western Region","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18772560","","","","English","Springer.

The inter-cohort patterns in US mortality, as well as their racial/ethnic disparities, are still unclear. Methods: Using official mortality data, we study US annual mortality rates for ages 25-54 from 1990 to 2016 by gender and race/ethnicity. We conduct an age-period-cohort analysis to disentangle the period and cohort forces driving the absolute changes in mortality across cohorts. Nine leading causes of death are also explored to explain the inter-cohort mortality patterns and their racial/ethnic disparities. Results: We find cohort-specific elevated mortality trends for gender- and race/ethnicity-specific populations. For non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics, Baby Boomers have increased mortality trends compared with other cohorts. For non-Hispanic White females, it is late-Gen Xers and early-Gen Yers for whom the mortality trends are higher than other cohorts. For non-Hispanic White males, the elevated mortality pattern is found for Baby Boomers, late-Gen Xers, and early-Gen Yers. The mortality pattern among Baby Boomers is at least partially driven by mortality related to drug poisoning, suicide, external causes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HIV/AIDS for all race and gender groups affected. The elevated mortality patterns among late-Gen Xers and early-Gen Yers are at least partially driven by mortality related to drug poisonings and alcohol-related diseases for non-Hispanic Whites. Differential patterns of drug poisoning-related mortality play an important role in the racial/ethnic disparities in these mortality patterns. Conclusions: We find substantial racial/ethnic disparities in inter-cohort mortality patterns.

Objective: To explore sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based case-control study used sex-specific genome-wide association study and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to examine sex differences in genetic associations with longevity. Five hundred sixty-four male and 1614 female participants older than 100 years were compared with a control group of 773 male and 1526 female individuals aged 40 to 64 years. All were Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study participants with Han ethnicity who were recruited in 1998 and 2008 to 2014. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sex-specific loci and pathways associated with longevity and PRS measures of joint effects of sex-specific loci. Results: Eleven male-specific and 11 female-specific longevity loci (P < 10-5) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific longevity loci (10-5≤ P < 10-4) were identified. Each of these loci's associations with longevity were replicated in north and south regions of China in one sex but were not significant in the other sex (P =.13-.97), and loci-sex interaction effects were significant (P <.05). The associations of loci rs60210535 of the LINC00871 gene with longevity were replicated in Chinese women (P = 9.0 × 10-5) and US women (P = 4.6 × 10-5) but not significant in Chinese and US men. The associations of the loci rs2622624 of the ABCG2 gene were replicated in Chinese women (P = 6.8 × 10-5) and European women (P =.003) but not significant in both Chinese and European men. Eleven male-specific pathways (inflammation and immunity genes) and 34 female-specific pathways (tryptophan metabolism and PGC-1α induced) were significantly associated with longevity (P <.005; false discovery rate < 0.05). The PRS analyses demonstrated that sex-specific associations with longevity of the 4 exclusive groups of 11 male-specific and 11 female-specific loci (P < 10-5) and 35 male-specific and 25 female-specific loci (10-5≤P < 10-4) were jointly replicated across north and south discovery and target samples. Analyses using the combined data set of north and south showed that these 4 groups of sex-specific loci were jointly and significantly associated with longevity in one sex (P = 2.9 × 10-70to 1.3 × 10-39) but not jointly significant in the other sex (P =.11 to.70), while interaction effects between PRS and sex were significant (P = 4.8 × 10-50to 1.2 × 10-16). Conclusion and Relevance: The sex differences in genetic associations with longevity are remarkable, but have been overlooked by previously published genome-wide association studies on longevity. This study contributes to filling this research gap and provides a scientific basis for further investigating effects of sex-specific genetic variants and their interactions with environment on healthy aging, which may substantially contribute to more effective and targeted individualized health care for male and female elderly individuals. © 2018 American Medical Association.

In this paper, we describe an approach to analyses of longitudinal data based on the use of stochastic process models of human aging, health, and longevity which allows for incorporating state of the art advances in aging research into the model structure. In particular, the model incorporates the notions of resistance to stresses, adaptive capacity, and ""optimal"" (normal) physiological states. To capture the effects of exposure to persistent external disturbances, the notions of allostatic adaptation and allostatic load are introduced. These notions facilitate the description and explanation of deviations of individuals' physiological indices from their normal states, which increase the chances of disease development and death. The model provides a convenient conceptual framework for comprehensive systemic analyses of aging-related changes in humans using longitudinal data and linking these changes with genotyping profiles, morbidity, and mortality risks. The model is used for developing new statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data on aging, health, and longevity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Allostatic load; Longitudinal data analysis; Physiological norms; Stochastic process model of aging and mortality; Stress resistance","Aging; Health; Humans; Life Expectancy; Longevity; Longitudinal Studies; Proportional Hazards Models; Physiology; Plants (botany); Random processes; Allostatic load; Longitudinal data; Physiological norms; Stochastic process model; Stress resistance; aging; article; health; human; life expectancy; longevity; longitudinal study; proportional hazards model; statistics; Health","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG027019, R01AG030198, R01AG030612, R01AG032319)","The work was partially supported by grants R01AG030612 , R01AG030198 and R01AG032319 from the National Institute on Aging .

Such a significant association is replicated in two independent Han Chinese CLHLS cohorts (p = 0.028-0.048 in the discovery and replication cohorts, and p = 0.003-0.016 in the combined dataset). We found the associations between tea drinking and reduced mortality are much stronger among carriers of the FOXO1A-209 genotype compared to non-carriers, and drinking tea is associated with a reversal of the negative effects of carrying FOXO1A-209 minor alleles, that is, from a substantially increased mortality risk to substantially reduced mortality risk at advanced ages. The impacts are considerably stronger among those who carry two copies of the FOXO1A minor allele than those who carry one copy. On the basis of previously reported experiments on human cell models concerning FOXO1A-by-tea-compounds interactions, we speculate that results in the present study indicate that tea drinking may inhibit FOXO1A-209 gene expression and its biological functions, which reduces the negative impacts of FOXO1A-209 gene on longevity (as reported in the literature) and offers protection against mortality risk at oldest-old ages. Our empirical findings imply that the health outcomes of particular nutritional interventions, including tea drinking, may, in part, depend upon individual genetic profiles, and the research on the effects of nutrigenomics interactions could potentially be useful for rejuvenation therapies in the clinic or associated healthy aging intervention programs. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.","","Age Factors;

Four self-reported experiences of bullying behavior that occurred at school or in transit to and from school are studied: threatened without a weapon, threatened with a weapon, injured without a weapon, and injured with a weapon. Zero-inflated Poisson models are used to estimate intensity (or rate) and likelihood of exposure (or probability) parameters of the annual frequency distributions of the four bullying behaviors. For the intensity of bullying victimization, as measured by the average number of times 12th graders were bullied annually, it is found, first, that there indeed was a wave of increased bullying behaviors in the 2002-2009 years that coincides with increased media attention and reporting during these years. Second, it is shown that this recent upsurge is similar to what happened in the early 1990s - but the most recent wave reached higher levels of intensity. Third, the analyses reveal that the intensity and/or exposure parameters covary with several demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors and these differentials persist over time. While 12th graders who were male or African American, city dwellers, and from single-parent or no-parent families show persistently higher intensities of bullying victimization over time, greater probabilities of exposure are found for 12th graders who were male, were from single-parent or no- parent families, did not regularly attend religious services, regarded religion as less important, and showed worse school performance. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","School bullying; School violence; Single-parent and non-parent families; Zero-inflated poisson distribution","","","","","","Foundation for Child Development, FCD","This research was supported by a research grant from the Foundation for Child Development.

In this research, we propose a new generalized Poisson-multinomial mixture approach to model grouped and right-censored (GRC) count data. Based on a mixed Poisson-multinomial process for conceptualizing grouped and right-censored count data, we prove that the new maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE-GRC) is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed for both Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson models. The use of the MLE-GRC, implemented in an R function, is illustrated by both statistical simulation and empirical examples. This research provides a tool for epidemiologists to estimate incidence from grouped and right-censored count data and lays a foundation for regression analyses of such data structure. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Grouped and right-censored count data;

The proportion of elderly households with at least one person aged 65+ will increase dramatically in China in the next few decades. By the years 2030 and 2050, the proportion of the elderly aged 65+ living in empty-nest households without children among the total population will be 2.5 and 3.7 times that in 2000. The increase in percentages of the oldest-old living in empty-nest households will be even more dramatic: 4 and 11.5 times as high as in 2000 for the years 2030 and 2050. These aging population structure problems – with respect to proportion of elderly and elderly households as well as proportion of elderly living in empty-nest households – will be much more serious in rural areas than in urban areas. This strongly suggests that, to avoid serious social problems in the future China needs to change its household registration policy which restricts free movement from rural to urban areas and to adopt policies encouraging rural-to-urban family migration or family reunion after young migrants settle down in urban areas. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Dependency Ratio; Elderly Household; Family Household; Medium Fertility; Standard Schedule","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18772560","","","","English","Springer.

(2015) demonstrated that hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) models perform well when basic assumptions are satisfied. To contest this finding, Bell and Jones (2015) invent a data generating process (DGP) that borrows age, period and cohort effects from different equations in Reither et al. (2015). When HAPC models applied to data simulated from this DGP fail to recover the patterning of APC effects, B&J reiterate their view that these models provide ""misleading evidence dressed up as science."" Despite such strong words, B&J show no curiosity about their own simulated data-and therefore once again misapply HAPC models to data that violate important assumptions. In this response, we illustrate how a careful analyst could have used simple descriptive plots and model selection statistics to verify that (a) period effects are not present in these data, and (b) age and cohort effects are conflated. By accounting for the characteristics of B&J's artificial data structure, we successfully recover the ""true"" DGP through an appropriately specified model. We conclude that B&Js main contribution to science is to remind analysts that APC models will fail in the presence of exact algebraic effects (i.e., effects with no random/stochastic components), and when collinear temporal dimensions are included without taking special care in the modeling process. The expanded list of coauthors on this commentary represents an emerging consensus among APC scholars that B&J's essential strategy-testing HAPC models with data simulated from contrived DGPs that violate important assumptions-is not a productive way to advance the discussion about innovative APC methods in epidemiology and the social sciences. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Age-period-cohort models; Body mass index; Cohort effects; Hierarchical modeling; Obesity epidemic; Random effects; Simulation models; Social change","Cohort Effect; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Obesity; body mass; cohort analysis; hierarchical age periode cohort model; Note; obesity; prevalence; simulation; social change; sociology; statistical model; epidemiology; female; health disparity; human; male; obesity","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (K01AG036745, P50CA058223); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD050924)","","Bell A., Jones K., Should age-period-cohort analysts accept innovation without scrutiny?

We find that overweight prevalence rates increase throughout adulthood until the early 50s. Period effects are very strong with a virtually monotonic increase from 1989 to 2009. Yet, as posited by the reversal hypothesis (a diminishing positive association between overweight prevalence and socioeconomic status alongside development), this increase is levelling off or absent in most recent survey waves for women, urban residents, and individuals with higher educational attainment. Most importantly, substantial period variations are explained by rapid urbanisation, and the period increases in overweight prevalence closely track the pace of urbanisation in China. Cohorts born in the beginning years of the Great Chinese Famine (1958–1961) have the highest overweight prevalence rates, whereas cohorts experiencing the Famine during the childhood ages of adiposity rebound (the next rise in body mass index after infancy, typically from age 5 to 7 years) are significantly less likely to be overweight. These cohort patterns lend support to the critical-period hypothesis. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we discovered that genetic associations with longevity are on average stronger in females than in males through bio-demographic analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) dataset of 2178 centenarians and 2299 middle-age controls of Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS). This discovery is replicated across North and South regions of China, and is further confirmed by North-South discovery/replication analyses of different and independent datasets of Chinese healthy aging candidate genes with CLHLS participants who are not in CLHLS GWAS, including 2972 centenarians and 1992 middle-age controls. Our polygenic risk score analyses of eight exclusive groups of sex-specific genes, analyses of sex-specific and not-sex-specific individual genes, and Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis using all SNPs all reconfirm that genetic associations with longevity are on average stronger in females than in males. Our discovery/replication analyses are based on genetic datasets of in total 5150 centenarians and compatible middle-age controls, which comprises the worldwide largest sample of centenarians. The present study's findings may partially explain the well-known male-female health-survival paradox and suggest that genetic variants may be associated with different reactions between males and females to the same vaccine, drug treatment and/or nutritional intervention. Thus, our findings provide evidence to steer away from traditional view that “one-size-fits-all” for clinical interventions, and to consider sex differences for improving healthcare efficiency. We suggest future investigations focusing on effects of interactions between sex-specific genetic variants and environment on longevity as well as biological function. © 2023 The Authors","Centenarians; Longevity; Male-female health-survival paradox; Polygenic risk score analysis; Precise healthcare for males and females; sex differences","","","","","","United States NIA; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P01AG031719, P30AG028716); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72061137004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFC2000404); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This study is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC2000404; XYL, YZ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72061137004; XYL, YZ), and the United States NIA/NIH (P01AG031719, YZ, JWV; P30AG028716, AMO).","Van Oyen H., Nusselder W., Jagger C., Kolip P., Cambois E., Robine J.M., Gender differences in healthy life years within the EU: an exploration of the “health–survival” paradox, Int.

These input parameters can be derived from commonly available data. The illustrative application to China demonstrates that if the average age at retirement gradually increases from the current very low level to age 65 for both men and women in 2050, the annual pension deficit rate would be largely reduced or eliminated under various possible demographic regimes up to the middle of this century. With everything else being equal, the annual pension deficit rate in the scenario of medium fertility (associated with a two-child policy) would be much lower than that under low fertility (associated with the current fertility policy unchanged) after 2030. The impact of potentially faster mortality decline is likely sizable but relatively moderate; it starts earlier than the effects of fertility change. Note that one may also use the simple method presented in this chapter to explore the magnitude and timing of impacts on future pension deficits due to alternative international migration and/or pension policies by predicting or assuming the size and age/gender structure of international migration and/or the pension program parameters. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Define Benefit; Define Contribution; Pension Fund; Pension System; Total Fertility Rate","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18772560","","","","English","Springer.

It commences by citing the distinction of social facts from individual actions, identifies three requirements of theories of social change, shows how the 'Population, Organization, Environment, and Technology' (POET) model can be used to understand the loci of change identified in different models of social change, focuses on actors and structures and actor assumptions and structure assumptions as key elements of models of social change, and notes the distinctions of intentions of actors from the effects of their actions and expectations from desired consequences. The article concludes by identifying examples of formal systems - mathematics, statistics, and computational algorithms - that have been used to develop and assess models of social change. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

From the stagflation and socially turbulent days of the 1970s in the US through the decline of the rust belt industries and transition to the information age in the 1980s to the relatively prosperous e-economy and multicultural years of the late-1990s followed by the economically uncertain and politically anxious early years of the twenty-first century, Americans have fretted over the material circumstances of the nation’s children, their health and safety, their educational progress, and their moral development. Are their fears and concerns warranted? How do we know whether circumstances of life for children in the United States are bad and worsening or good and improving? On what basis can the public and its leaders form opinions and draw conclusions? © Springer Science+Business Media B.V 2012.","Global Life Satisfaction; High Teen Birth Rate; Life Satisfaction; Life Satisfaction Report; Social Indicator","","","","","","","","Andrews F.M., Withey S.B., Social indicators of well-being: Americans’ perceptions of life quality, (1976); Bauer R.A., Social indicators, (1966); Ben-Arieh A., Where are the children?

This approach has two potential limitations: each generation is typically divided into several equally sized income groups based on percentile ranking to create ad-hoc social classes or into predetermined broad occupational groups, and inter- and intragenerational changes in social class are not jointly analyzed. To address these limitations, we construct intergenerational income mobility tables using an alternative, group-based trajectory approach to determine the number of socioeconomic groups and characterize the development of social status over the course of individuals’ working lives. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968–2017), we show intergenerational differences in income dynamics as each generation's life-cycle profile unfolds. Specifically, parents and offspring who, based on their average household incomes, belong to different income strata may have similar working life-course income trajectory patterns. As a result, by focusing exclusively on the average income levels, studies using income quintiles for mobility tables may underestimate intergenerational income associations. © 2022","Gender; Income trajectory; Intergenerational mobility; Mobility table","","","","","","Eunice Shriver Kennedy National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-ment Population Research Infrastructure Program; Penn Population Studies Center; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P2C-HD044964); National Institutes of Health, NIH","We are grateful to support from the Penn Population Studies Center , which receives support by the Eunice Shriver Kennedy National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-ment Population Research Infrastructure Program ( NIH P2C-HD044964 ).

Method: To further develop and apply the ProFamy extended cohort-component method and the most recent census and survey data. Results: (a) Chinese disabled elders and the annual growth rate of the percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to home-based care costs for disabled elders will increase much more rapidly than the growth of total elderly population; (b) home-based care needs and costs for disabled oldest-old aged 80+ will increase much faster than that for disabled young-old aged 65-79 after 2030; (c) disabled unmarried elders living alone and their home-based care costs increase substantially faster than those disabled unmarried elders living with children; (d) percent of rural disabled oldest-old will be substantially higher than that of rural population after 2030; (e) sensitivity analyses show that possible changes in mortality and elderly disability status are the major direct factors affecting home-based care needs and costs; (f) caregivers resources under the universal two-child policy will be substantially better than that under the rigorous fertility policy unchanged. Discussion: We discuss policy recommendations concerning pathways to healthy aging with relatively reduced care costs, including reductions of the prevalence of disability, gender equality, the universal two-child policy and resources of caregivers, encouragements of rural-to-urban family migration and elder's residential proximity to their adult children, and remarriages of not-married elders. © The Author(s) 2014.","disability; elderly living arrangements; home-based care costs; household projection; population aging","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; China; Cohort Studies; Disabled Persons; Family Characteristics; Female; Forecasting; Health Care Costs; Health Services Needs and Demand; Home Care Services; Humans; Male; Residence Characteristics; aged; China; cohort analysis; demography; disabled person; economics; family size; female; forecasting; health care cost; health service; home care; human; male; rehabilitation; statistics and numerical data; trends; very elderly","","","","","Humanity and Social Science Key Research Centers Foundation of Ministry of Education of China, (2009JJD790001); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P30AG034424); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71110107025, 71233001); Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, (10YJC790021)","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is funded by the research grants of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71110107025, 71233001) (Y.Z.), the major project of Humanity and Social Science Key Research Centers Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (2009JJD790001) (Y.Z.), and Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (10YJC790021) (H.C.).","Bongaarts J., Family Demography, Methods and Applications, pp. 189-212, (1987); Bongaarts J., Feeney G., On the quantum and tempo of fertility, Population and Development Review, 24, pp. 271-291, (1998); Projections of National Health Expenditures: Methodology and Model Specification, (2004); Chen H., Research on Elderly Population, Family, Health and Care Needs/costs, pp. 350-352, (2010); Dalton M., O'Neill B., Prskawetz A., Jiang L., Pitkin J., Population aging and future carbon emissions in the United States, Energy Economics, 30, pp. 642-675, (2008); Du P., Wu C., Ability of daily life of the Chinese elderly: Status and change, Population Research, 30, pp. 50-56, (2006); Feng Q., Wang Z., Gu D., Zeng Y., Household vehicle consumption forecasts in the United States, 2000 to 2025, International Journal of Market Research, 53, pp. 593-618, (2011); Fries J.F., Aging, natural death, and the compression of morbidity, New England Journal of Medicine, 303, pp. 130-135, (1980); Goodkind D., Review on the book healthy longevity in china: Demographic, socioeconomic, and psychological dimensions, Population Studies, 63, pp. 1-7, (2009); Grundy E., Living Arrangements and the Health of Older Persons in Developed Countries, United Nations Population Bulletin, Special Issue Nos. 42/43, pp. 311-329, (2001); Grundy E., Held at the 27th General Conference of International Union for Scientific Population Studied (IUSSP); Gu D., Healthy Longevity in China: Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Psychological Dimensions, pp. 39-60, (2008); Gu D., Zeng Y., Changes of disability in activities of daily living among the Chinese elderly from 1992 to 2002, Population & Economics, 4, pp. 9-13, (2006); Health Status in Shanghai, 2011, (2012); Hu A., Tang W., Wang H., Mo Z., Wang B., Chen Z., Reasonably distribute the eldercare health service, Population and Economics, 138, 3, pp. 13-18, (2003); Huang C., Elderly health and family care burden in China, Chinese Health Resources, 9, 5, pp. 208-210, (2006); Jiang C., The Analysis and Prediction on the ADL Care Cost for the Chinese Elderly (PhD Thesis), (2008); Lakdawalla D., Goldman D.P., Bhattacharya J., Hurd M.D., Joyce G.F., Panis C.W.A., Forecasting the nursing home population, Medical Care, 41, pp. 8-20, (2003); Land K.C., Guralnik J.M., Blazer D.G., Estimating increment-decrement life tables with multiple covariates from panel data: The case of active life expectancy, Demography, 31, pp. 297-319, (1994); Lee R.D., Tuljapurkar S., Demographic Changes and Fiscal Policy, pp. 7-57, (2001); Lee R., Mason A., Some macroeconomic aspects of global population aging, Demography, 47, 1, pp. 151-S172, (2010); Li J., Economic analysis of burdens for elderly population in China, Population Research, 22, 6, pp. 5-10, (1998); Li L., Chen Q., 21st Century Population and Economic Development in China, pp. 221-235, (2006); Liang H., Studies on self-supporting abilities of rural elderly in China, Population and Economics, 115, 4, pp. 21-25, (1999); Manton K.G., Changing concepts of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population, The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly.

Since the data used in this study are multilevel and the dependent variable is dichotomous, a generalized hierarchical linear model was used for analysis of the data. This study reveals that both community structural variables (residential stability and poverty) and community process variables (social ties, collective efficacy and semi-formal control) were found to affect individuals' perceptions of neighborhood property crime in Guangzhou. However, communities in Guangzhou are different from those in big cities in the US. This is evidenced by several findings in this study: (1) poorer communities in Guangzhou were not associated with lower levels of formal and informal control; (2) communities with higher levels of residential mobility were neither linked to higher levels of poverty nor disorganization; and (3) the correlation between residential stability and perceived neighborhood property crime was not mediated by community processes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","China; Collective efficacy;

Associations between tea drinking and reduced cognitive disability were much stronger among carriers of the genotypes of FOXO1A-266 or FOXO3-310 or FOXO3-292 compared with noncarriers, and it was reconfirmed by analysis of three-way interactions across FOXO genotypes, tea drinking at around age 60, and at present time. Based on prior findings from animal and human cell models, we postulate that intake of tea compounds may activate FOXO gene expression, which in turn may positively affect cognitive function in the oldest old population. Our empirical findings imply that the health benefits of particular nutritional interventions, including tea drinking, may, in part, depend upon individual genetic profiles. © 2014 The Author.","Cognitive disability;

In this chapter, we present and discuss the results of a series of epidemiologic and biodemographic measures that can be studied using the Medicare Files of Service Use. Specifically, we present analyses of age patterns of disease incidence, their time trends, recovery and long-term remission after disease onsets, interdependence of multiple coexisting disease risks, mortality at advanced ages, and multimorbidity patterns. Empirical analyses, regression models, and methods of mathematical modeling are used to evaluate their characteristics. U.S. Medicare data serve as an example of Big Data that is a powerful source of information about current and historic health of older U.S. adults. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Asthma Incidence; Cardiovascular Health Study; Disease Incidence; Incidence Rate; Medicare Data","","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG043352, R01AG027019, R01AG030198, R01AG030612, R01AG032319, R01AG046860, R21 AG045245); National Institute on Aging, NIA","Acknowledgements The research reported in this chapter was supported by the National Institute on Aging grants R01AG027019, R01AG030612, R01AG030198, R01AG032319, R01AG046860, R21 AG045245, and P01AG043352.","Akushevich I., Manton K., 31–April 2).

This study aims to provide a more holistic review and critical assessment of the overall methodological significance of the IE and related estimators in age-period-cohort analysis. We derive the statistical properties of the IE from a linear algebraic perspective, provide more precise mathematical proofs relevant to the current debate, and demonstrate the essential, yet overlooked, link between the IE and classical statistical tools that have been employed by scholars for decades. This study offers guidelines for the future use of the IE and related estimators in demographic research.

The first is by increasing levels of criminal motivation within the population as deteriorating economic conditions affect social strain and social control; the second is by influencing the availability and vulnerability of criminal targets and thus the number of criminal opportunities. Although much empirical research has applied this theoretical model, few analyses have done so at disaggregated units of analysis. We present the most comprehensive analysis to date by empirically evaluating this model with data on 400 of the largest US counties - and examine the effects of aggregation on results as these county data are combined to the state and national levels - for the years 1978-2005. For seven Index crimes at each of the three levels of analysis, and with or without controls for structural covariates at each level, the directional effects hypothesized by Cantor and Land are found for 78 out of 84 estimated relationships. Even after taking into account the lack of statistical independence of these estimates by drawing on recently developed statistical theory, this is a very unlikely outcome. In accordance with expectations based on theory and prior research, (a) some of these relationships are weak and not statistically significant, and (b) the strongest and most consistent patterns of relationships for both the crime opportunity and crime motivation effects are found for three property crimes: burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

Frailty models introduce the concept of unobserved or hidden heterogeneity in survival analysis for time-to-event data. Longitudinal data provide an additional source of heterogeneity that can contribute to differences in risks of time-to-event outcomes. Individual age trajectories of biomarkers can differ due to various observed as well as unobserved factors and such individual differences propagate to differences in risks of related time-to-event outcomes such as the onset of a disease or death. In this chapter, we briefly review recent biostatistical approaches to deal with heterogeneity, focusing on approaches that model both time-to-event and longitudinal data such as joint models (see Chap. 11 ). One of the approaches to deal with hidden heterogeneity assumes that a population under study may consist of “latent” subpopulations or classes with distinct patterns of longitudinal trajectories of biomarkers that can also have different effects on the time-to-event outcome in each subpopulation. Within the joint modeling framework, a special class of models, joint latent class models, was developed to account for such heterogeneity in a population.

These anticipated demographic changes will alter the number and proportion of different kinds of households, producing important questions for the future. How many elderly persons will live alone, with spouse only, with children or other relatives, or be institutionalized? How many elderly persons will need assistance in daily activities, but will not have children and/or spouse to provide help? How many middle-age persons will have responsibilities to care for both elderly parents and young children? How many children will live in a single-parent household? How many teenage and adult single mothers will have to care for their children with no spouse or partner present? What are the implications of these changing scenarios for family caregiving and the health service system? The new method and user-friendly software for family household and living arrangement projection presented in this book can be used to answer these and other important questions. The method of projecting and evaluating the consequences of demographic changes on future family household dynamics and living arrangements is clearly useful in empirical studies, development of theories, policy analyses, and business management. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Demographic Rate; Family Household; Headship Rate; Household Type; Living Arrangement","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18772560","","","","English","Springer.

Its intellectual/disciplinary roots lie in welfare economics, development economics, and the social indicators movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The objective of the HDI is to rank countries on a scale of human development conceptualized in terms of capabilities of humans within the countries to function. Because it seeks to be as inclusive as possible of the countries of the world, the general HDI is based on only four statistics measuring life expectancy, education, and income at the country level. The HDI and its associated Report have been calculated and published annually since 1990 by the United Nations Human Development Programme. In recent years, the general HDI has been supplemented with three specialized indices: (1) the Inequality-Adjusted HDI (IHDI); (2) the Gender Inequality Index (GII); and (3) the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","","","","","","","","","Ahuvia A.C., Friedman D.C., Income, consumption, and subjective wellbeing: Toward a composite macromarketing model, Journal of Macromarketing, 18, pp. 153-168, (1998); Andrews F.M., Research on the Quality of Life, (1986); Andrews F.M., The evolution of a movement, Journal of Public Policy, 9, pp. 401-405, (1989); Andrews F.M., Withey S.B., Social Indicators of Well-Being: Americans’ Perceptions of Life Quality, (1976); Barro R.J., Lee J.W., A New Data Set of Educational Attainment in the World, 1950-2010, (2010); Bauer R.A., Social Indicators, (1966); Bell D., The idea of a social report, The Public Interest, 15, pp. 72-84, (1969); Bentham J., 1970).

Studies of the connections between aging and life span suggest that the dynamic properties of the age trajectories of the physiological indices could also be important contributors to morbidity and mortality risks. In this chapter, we use data from the Framingham Heart Study on longitudinal changes in body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, pulse rate, blood glucose, hematocrit, and serum cholesterol of the participants to investigate this possibility in depth. We find that some of the variables describing the individual dynamics of the age-associated changes in physiological indices influence human longevity and exceptional health more substantially than the variables describing physiological state. These newly identified variables are promising targets for prevention efforts aiming to postpone the onset of common elderly diseases and increase longevity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Framingham Heart Study; Mortality Risk; Physiological Index; Systolic Blood Pressure; Ventricular Rate","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (1R01AG046860, P01AG043352, R01AG027019, R01AG030198, R01AG030612); National Institute on Aging, NIA; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements The research reported in this chapter was supported by the National Institute on Aging grants R01AG027019, R01AG030612, R01AG030198, 1R01AG046860, and P01AG043352.

To establish their conclusion, TSL use trend analyses, as well as more sophisticated mixed-effects models, but their analyses are problematic. In particular, TSL’s trend analyses ignore a crucial cohort effect: well-known lower happiness among baby boomers. Furthermore, their data aggregation obscures the ephemerality of a recent period effect: the Great Recession. Finally, TSL overlook a key finding of their mixed-effects models that both pre- and post-Boomer cohorts became happier as they aged from young to mature adults. Our reanalyses of the data establish that the Baby Boomer cohort, the short-lived Great Recession, and unfortunate data aggregation account for TSL’s results. The well-established, long-term relationship between age and happiness remains as it has been for decades despite any cultural shifts that may have occurred disfavoring mature adults. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","age–period–cohort; aging; Baby Boomers; Great Recession; happiness; subjective well-being","","","","","","","","Bell D.N., Blanchflower D.G., Young people and the Great Recession, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 27, pp. 241-267, (2011); Bell A., Jones K., Should age-period-cohort analysts accept innovation without scrutiny?

Using the National Neighborhood Crime Study and Census data, we conduct a multilevel spatial analysis of homicides in 8,307 census tracts. We find support for three indicators of differential institutional engagement (disengaged youth, educational engagement, employment engagement). An additional dimension of institutional engagement (familial engagement) operates in the expected direction but is not statistically significant. We argue that previous cross-sectional studies reporting a null or negative relationship between percentage of young and homicide are due to omitting measures of institutional youth (dis)engagement. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.","age structure; homicide; institutional engagement; multilevel modeling; neighborhood; spatial analysis","","","","","","","","Anderson E., Code of the street: Decency, violence, and the moral life of the inner-city, (1999); Anselin L., Cohen J., Cook C., Gorr W., Tita G., Spatial analyses of crime, Criminal justice: Vol. 4: Measurement and analysis of crime and justice, pp. 213-262, (2000); Baller R.D., Anselin L., Messner S.F., Deane G., Hawkins D.F., Structural covariates of U.S. County Homicide Rates: Incorporating spatial effects, Criminology, 39, pp. 561-590, (2001); Berg M.T., Stewart E.A., Brunson R.K., Simons R.L., Neighborhood cultural heterogeneity and adolescent violence, Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 28, pp. 411-435, (2012); Bivand R., Piras G., Comparing implementations of estimation methods for spatial econometrics, Journal of Statistical Software, 63, 18, pp. 1-36, (2015); Blokland A.J., Nagin D.S., Nieuwbeerta P., Life span offending trajectories of a Dutch conviction cohort, Criminology, 43, pp. 919-954, (2005); Bursik R.J., Social disorganization and theories of crime and delinquency: Problems and prospects, Criminology, 26, pp. 519-551, (1988); Bursik R.J., Grasmick H.G., Neighborhoods and crime: The dimensions of effective community control, (1993); Bursik R.J., Webb J., Community change and patterns of delinquency, American Journal of Sociology, 88, pp. 24-42, (1982); Bushway S.D., Thornberry T.P., Krohn M.D., Desistance as a developmental process: A comparison of static and dynamic approaches, Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 19, pp. 129-153, (2003); Chiricos T.G., Rates of crime and unemployment: An analysis of aggregate research evidence, Social Problems, 34, pp. 187-212, (1987); Cohen J., Cohen P., Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences, (1983); Crutchfield R.D., Geerken M.R., Gove W.R., Crime rate and social integration: The impact of metropolitan mobility, Criminology, 20, pp. 467-478, (1982); DeFronzo J., Economic assistance to impoverished Americans: Relationship to incidence of crime, Criminology, 21, pp. 119-136, (1983); D'Unger A.V., Land K.C., McCall P.L., Nagin D.S., How many latent classes of delinquent/criminal careers?

It has also been proposed that measures of subjective wellbeing are inadequate for this purpose. These ideas are examined in relation to capabilities, using the same reference material as the proposing author. The theory of subjective wellbeing homeostasis is used as the alternative framework by which to understand the potential of subjective wellbeing for policy advice. This examination reveals an almost complete lack of evidence that capability measurement could fulfill the suggested role. While subjective wellbeing has more potential for this purpose, caveats to its employment for policy advice are also evident. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Capabilities; Homeostasis; Measurement; Public policy; Subjective wellbeing; Theory","Austin [Texas]; Texas; United States; conceptual framework; employment; homeostasis; policy approach; social theory; theoretical study","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2013S1A3A2054622); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Acknowledgement This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A3A2054622).","Allan B.A., Duffy R.D., Examining moderators of signature strengths use and well-being: Calling and signature strengths level, Journal of Happiness Studies, 15, 2, pp. 323-337, (2014); Anand P., Hunter G., Carter I., Dowding K., Guala F., Van Hees M., The development of capability indicators, Journal of Human Development and Capabilities, 10, 1, pp. 125-152, (2009); Anand P., Santos C., Smith R., The measurement of capabilities, Festschrift for Prof Amartya Sen, pp. 283-310, (2009); Andrews F.M., Withey S.B., Social indicators of well-being: American’s perceptions of life quality, (1976); Austin A., On well-being and public policy: Are we capable of questioning the hegemony of happiness?, Social Indicators Research, 127, 1, pp. 123-138, (2016); Biswas-Diener R., Diener E., Making the best of a bad situation: Satisfaction in the slums of Calcutta, Social Indicators Research, 55, pp. 329-352, (2001); Blalock H.M., Causal inferences in nonexperimental research, (1964); Blore J.D., Stokes M.A., Mellor D., Firth L., Cummins R.A., Comparing multiple discrepancies theory to affective models of subjective wellbeing, Social Indicators Research, 100, 1, pp. 1-16, (2011); Brenner B., Quality of affect and self-evaluated happiness, Social Indicators Research, 2, 3, pp. 315-331, (1975); Brickman P., Campbell D.T., Hedonic relativism and planning the good society, Adaptation-level theory: A symposium, pp. 287-302, (1971); Burchardt T., Happiness and social policy: Barking up the right tree in the wrong neck of the woods, Analysis and debate in social policy, pp. 145-164, (2006); Burchardt T., Vizard P., Definition of Equality and Framework for Measurement: Final Recommendations of the Equalities Review Steering Group on Measurement, (2007); Burchardt T., Vizard P., Using the capability approach to evaluate health and care for individuals and groups in England, The capability approach: From theory to practice, pp. 148-170, (2014); Capic T., Li N., Cummins R.A., Confirmation of Subjective Wellbeing Set-Points: Foundational for Subjective Social Indicators, Social Indicators Research, 137, 1, pp. 1-28, (2017); Cummins R.A., Subjective wellbeing, homeostatically protected mood and depression: A synthesis, Journal of Happiness Studies, 11, pp. 1-17, (2010); Cummins R.A., Subjective wellbeing homeostasis, Oxford Bibliographies Online, (2013); Cummins R.A., Can happiness change?

To assess the accuracy of the combined ratio method and ProFamy approach and present illustrative applications, we calculated projections from 1990 to 2000 and compared projected estimates with census-observed counts in 2000 for sets of randomly selected 25 small counties and 25 small cities which were more or less evenly distributed across the United States. The comparisons show that, in general, most forecast errors are reasonably small – mostly less than or slightly more than 5%.

This makes the systemic description of aging-related changes embedded in data from different studies a difficult task. Indeed, observational studies typically measure not only major changes in health and well-being captured by well-defined risk factors (e.g., physiological measurements), but also various aging-related changes spread throughout hundreds of distinct variables. The connection between such variables as well as between each of these variables and health or survival outcomes is unclear and often cannot be evaluated statistically with acceptable accuracy. This is due to the fact that the number of these variables is typically large, while the effect of each on health and survival is small, so most estimates of effect parameters in corresponding statistical models are statistically non-significant. This chapter describes a line of analysis that is based on the premise that, by taking such “mild-effect” variables into account, the description of aging-related deterioration in health and well-being in humans can be substantially improved without costly investments in collecting new data. To realize this potential, new statistical methods are required. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Abnormal Laboratory Test; Birth Cohort; Framingham Heart Study; Phenotypic Frailty; Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factor","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P01AG043352, R01AG030198, R01AG030612, R01AG032319, R01AG046860, U01 AG023746); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; Boston University, BU, (N01-HC-25195, N02-HL-64278); Boston University, BU","This chapter was partly supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under Award Numbers R01AG030198, R01AG032319, R01AG030612, R01AG046860, P01AG043352, and U01 AG023746.

First, we pose the question: How does the well-being of American youths in recent years compare with that of a generation ago when the parents of today’s children themselves were youths? Because most of the key indicator time series of the Child and Youth Well-Being Index date back to the mid-1970s and because the mean length of a generation is about 25–30 years (the modal age of childbearing in recent decades has been approximately 28), we can use the indicators and composite indices of the CWI to address this question. Secondly, we turn our attention to international comparisons and pose the question: How well are America’s children and youth doing in recent years as compared to the children and youth of other nations? Land et al. (2011) addressed this question by comparing data on a number of child and youth well-being indicators for the USA and four other English-speaking countries, specifically Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK.

Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Han Chinese with a sample size 2.7 times the largest previously published GWAS on centenarians. We identified 11 independent loci associated with longevity replicated in Southern-Northern regions of China, including two novel loci (rs2069837-IL6; rs2440012-ANKRD20A9P) with genome-wide significance and the rest with suggestive significance (P < 3.65 × 10-5). Eight independent SNPs overlapped across Han Chinese, European and U.S. populations, and APOE and 5q33.3 were replicated as longevity loci. Integrated analysis indicates four pathways (starch, sucrose and xenobiotic metabolism; immune response and inflammation; MAPK; calcium signaling) highly associated with longevity (P ≤ 0.006) in Han Chinese. The association with longevity of three of these four pathways (MAPK; immunity; calcium signaling) is supported by findings in other human cohorts. Our novel finding on the association of starch, sucrose and xenobiotic metabolism pathway with longevity is consistent with the previous results from Drosophilia. This study suggests protective mechanisms including immunity and nutrient metabolism and their interactions with environmental stress play key roles in human longevity.","","Apolipoproteins E; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; China; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Longevity; Membrane Transport Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; apolipoprotein E; carrier protein; TOMM40 protein, human; Asian continental ancestry group; China; gene locus; gene regulatory network; genetics; genome-wide association study; human; longevity; principal component analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism","","carrier protein, 80700-39-6; Apolipoproteins E, ; Membrane Transport Proteins, ; TOMM40 protein, human, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 AG023627); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P30AG028716, U19AG023122); National Institute on Aging, NIA; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71233001, 71490732); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (259679); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2013CB530700); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This study is supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2013CB530700) (XLT, TN, YZ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71233001, 71490732) (YZ), NIA/NIH (R01 AG023627, YZ; Pepper Center Grant P30AG028716, ERH; U19AG023122, TP, PS).

And how does one assess the overall statistical significance of the cohort and/or the period effects? Beyond statistical significance is the question of substantive significance. This paper addresses these questions. In the context of empirical applications of linear and generalized linear mixed-model specifications of HAPC models using data on verbal test scores and voter turnout in U.S. presidential elections, respectively, we describe a two-step approach and a set of guidelines for assessing statistical significance. The guidelines include assessments of patterns of effects and statistical tests both for the effects of individual cohorts and time periods as well as for entire sets of cohorts and periods. The empirical applications show strong evidence that trends in verbal test scores are primarily cohort driven, while voter turnout is primarily a period phenomenon. © The Author 2013.

It then assesses the state of this field in the 2010s and identifies four key developments—the development of professional organizations that nurture its conceptual and empirical development; the widespread political, popular, and theoretical appeal of the quality-of-life (QOL) concept; a new era of the construction of composite or summary social indicators; and a recognition of the key role of the QOL concept in connecting social indicators to the study of subjective well-being—that have evolved over the past five decades and that are very much with us today. The final section of the paper poses the question of where the field should focus its energies. Beyond carrying on the existing research program, it argues that the field needs to recognize the substantial changes in the social and economic organization of contemporary societies as compared to the mid-1960s launch period for the Social Indicators Movement and develop new research foci for the years to come. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Quality-of-Life Research; Social Indicators Agenda; Social Indicators Movement; Social Reporting; Well-Being Indicators","assessment method; conceptual framework; empirical analysis; historical perspective; quality of life; research program; social development; social indicator","","","","","","","Abrams M., A review of work on subjective social indicators 1971–1975, (1976); Allardt E., About dimensions of welfare, (1973); Anderson R.E., World suffering and the quality of life, (2015); Andrews F.M., Comparative studies of life quality: Comments on the current state of the art and some issues for future research, The quality of life, pp. 273-286, (1980); Andrews F.M., Bulmer M., Ferriss A.L., Gershuny J., Glatzer W., Noll H.-H., Innes J.E., Johnston D.F., Macrae D., Vogel J., Ward M., Whatever happened to social indicators?

Within a single, consistent HAPC-GLMM statistical modeling framework, the authors synthesize APC models and methods for three research designs: age-by-time period tables of population rates or proportions, repeated cross-section sample surveys, and accelerated longitudinal panel studies. The authors show how the empirical application of the models to various problems leads to many fascinating findings on how outcome variables develop along the age, period, and cohort dimensions. The book makes two essential contributions to quantitative studies of time-related change. Through the introduction of the GLMM framework, it shows how innovative estimation methods and new model specifications can be used to tackle the ""model identification problem"" that has hampered the development and empirical application of APC analysis. The book also addresses the major criticism against APC analysis by explaining the use of new models within the GLMM framework to uncover mechanisms underlying age patterns and temporal trends. Encompassing both methodological expositions and empirical studies, this book explores the ways in which statistical models, methods, and research designs can be used to open new possibilities for APC analysis. It compares new and existing models and methods and provides useful guidelines on how to conduct APC analysis. For empirical illustrations, the text incorporates examples from a variety of disciplines, such as sociology, demography, and epidemiology. Along with details on empirical analyses, software and programs to estimate the models are available on the book's web page. © All rights reserved.","","","","","","","","","Fienberg S.E., Mason W.M., Identification and estimation of age-period- cohort models in the analysis of discrete archival data, Sociological Methodology, 10, pp. 1-67, (1979); Glenn N.D., Cohort analysis, (2005); Jemal A., Chu K.C., Tarone R.E., Recent trends in lung cancer mortality in the United States, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 93, pp. 277-283, (2001); Mason W.M., Fienberg S.E., Cohort analysis in social research: Beyond the identification problem, (1985); Tarone R.E., Chu K.C., Gaudette L.A., Birth cohort and calendar period trends in breast cancer mortality in the United States and Canada, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 89, pp. 251-256, (1997); Yang Y., Age/period/cohort distinctions, In Encyclopedia of health and aging, pp. 20-22, (2007); Yang Y., Age, period, cohort effects, In Encyclopedia of the life course and human development, pp. 6-10, (2009); Yang Y., Aging, cohorts, and methods, In Handbook of aging and the social sciences, pp. 17-30, (2010); Barker D.J.P., In utero programming of chronic disease, Clinical Science, 95, pp. 115-128, (1998); Ben-Shlomo Y., Kuh D., A life course approach to chronic disease epidemiology: Conceptual models, empirical challenges and interdisciplinary perspectives, International Journal of Epidemiology, 31, pp. 285-293, (2002); Clemmesen J., I Results from statistical research, British Journal of Radiology, 21, pp. 583-590, (1948); Crimmins E.M., Reynolds S.L., Saito Y., Trends in health and ability to work among the older working-age population, Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 54, pp. S31-S40, (1999); Derrick V.P.A., Observations on (1) errors on age on the population statistics of England and Wales and (2) the changes in mortality indicated by the national records, Journal of the Institute of Actuaries, 58, pp. 117-159, (1927); Elder G.H., Children of the Great Depression: Social change in life experience, (1974); Finch C.E., Crimmins E.M., Inflammatory exposure and historical change in human life-spans, Science, 305, pp. 1736-1739, (2004); Fogel R.W., Costa D.L., A theory of technophysio evolution, with some implications for forecasting population, health care costs, and pension costs, Demography, 34, pp. 49-66, (1997); Freedman V.A., Martin L.G., Understanding trends in functional limitations among older Americans, American Journal of Public Health, 88, pp. 1457-1462, (1998); Frost W.H., The age selection of mortality from tuberculosis in successive decades, The MilbankMemorial Fund Quarterly,, 18, pp. 61-66, (1940); Hamil-Luker J., Land K.C., Blau J., Diverse trajectories of cocaine use through early adulthood among rebellious and socially conforming youth, Social Science Research, 33, pp. 300-321, (2004); Hobcraft J., Menken J., Preston S., Age, period, and cohort effects in demog-raphy: A review, Population Index, 48, pp. 4-43, (1982); Hughes M.E., O'Rand A.M., The lives and times of the baby boomers, The American People Census 2000, pp. 224-258, (2004); Kasen S., Cohen P., Chen H., Castille D., Depression in adult women: Age changes and cohort effects, American Journal of Public Health, 93, pp. 2061-2066, (2003); Kermack W.O., McKendrick A.G., McKinlay P.L., Death-rates in Great Britain and Sweden: Expression of specific mortality rates as products of two factors, and some consequences thereof, Journal of Hygiene, 34, pp. 433-457, (1934); MacMahon B., Breast cancer at menopausal ages: An explanation of observed incidence changes, Cancer, 10, pp. 1037-1044, (1957); Riley M.W., On the significance of age in sociology, American Sociological Review, 52, pp. 1-14, (1987); Ryder N.B., The cohort as a concept in the study of social change, American Sociological Review, 30, pp. 843-861, (1965); Smith H.L., Advances in age-period-cohort analysis, Sociological Methods & Research, 36, pp. 287-296, (2008); Yang Y., Is old age depressing?

Two methods of composite index construction that have been widely applied empirically in recent decades are Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is based on an optimization principle, and the equal weights/minimax (EW/MM) method, which has been shown to have minimax statistical properties in the sense that it minimizes maximum possible disagreements among individuals on weights. This paper applies both of these methods to two empirical datasets of social indicators: 1) data on 25 well-being indicators used in the construction of state-level Child and Youth Well-being Indices for each of the 50 U.S. states, and 2) data on indicators of life expectancy, educational attainment, and income used in the construction of the United Nations Human Development Programme’s Human Development Index (HDI) for 188 countries. In these empirical contexts, we study issues of measurement sensitivity of the EW/MM and DEA methods to the numbers of indictors used in the construction of the composite indices and corresponding issues of robustness. We find that the DEA method is more sensitive to the numbers of component indicators than the EW/MM method. In addition, the composite indicators formed by the EW/MM and DEA methods become more similar as the numbers of indicators in the composites decreases. We also apply Chance-Constrained DEA method to reclassify countries in the HDI dataset by levels of human development. The resulting human development groupings of the DEA composite indices have a large overlap with those of the HDI in the Human Development Reports, which are based on fixed cut-off points derived from the quartiles of distributions of the HDI component indicators. © 2020, The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS) and Springer Nature B.V.","Child well-being index; Data envelopment analysis; Equal weights; Human development index; Sensitivity and robust analysis","","","","","","","","Anand S., Sen A., The income component of the human development index, Journal of Human Development and Capabilities, 1, 1, pp. 83-106, (2000); Badea A.C., Claudio M.R.S., Tarantola S., Bolado R., Composite indicators for security of energy supply using ordered weighted averaging, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 96, 6, pp. 651-662, (2011); Bedeian A.G., Mossholder K.W., On the use of the coefficient of variation as a measure of diversity, Organizational Research Methods, 3, 3, pp. 285-297, (2000); Booysen F., An overview and evaluation of composite indices of development, Social Indicators Research, 59, pp. 115-151, (2002); Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Chance-constrained programming, Management Science, 15, pp. 73-79, (1959); Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Chance-constrained and normal deviates, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 57, pp. 134-148, (1962); Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Deterministic equivalents for optimizing and satisficing under chance constraints, Operations Research, 11, pp. 18-39, (1963); Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Rhodes E., Measuring the efficiency of decision making units, European Journal of Operational Research, 2, pp. 429-444, (1978); Cherchye L., Moesen W., Rogge N., Van Puyenbroeck T., An introduction to ‘benefit of the doubt’ composite indicators, Social Indicators Research, 82, pp. 111-145, (2007); Cherchye L., Moesen W., Rogge N., Van Puyenbroeck T., Saisana M., Saltelli A., Liska R., Tarantola S., Creating composite indicators with DEA and robustness analysis: The case of the technology achievement index, The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 59, pp. 239-251, (2008); Costa D.S., Reflective, causal, and composite indicators of quality of life: A conceptual or an empirical distinction?, Quality of Life Research, 24, 9, pp. 2057-2065, (2015); Despotis D.K., Measuring human development via data envelopment analysis: The case of Asia and the Pacific, The International Journal of the Management Science, 33, pp. 385-390, (2005); Everitt B.S., Skrondal A., The Cambridge dictionary of statistics, (2010); Fare R., Karagiannis G., Hasannasab M., Margaritis D., A benefit-of-the-doubt model with reverse indicators, European Journal of Operational Research, 278, 2019, pp. 394-400, (2019); Filippetti A., Peyrache A., The patterns of technological capabilities of countries: A dual approach using composite indicators and data envelopment analysis, World Development, 39, 7, pp. 1108-1121, (2011); Floridi M., Pagni S., Falorni S., Luzzati T., An exercise in composite indicators construction: Assessing the sustainability of Italian regions, Ecological Economics, 70, 8, pp. 1440-1447, (2011); Freudenberg M., Composite Indicators of Country Performance: a Critical Assessment.

The results showed that, due to changes in household and population structure, demand for both owned housing and rental housing for elders aged 65+ will grow dramatically, but housing demand will decline for young people aged less than 35. One-person households will have the largest growth in demand for 1–2 room owned-housing; one-couple households will have the largest growth in demand for 3–4 room owned-housing. Demand for larger housing units for three-generation households will go down. Based on our analysis, we discussed some relevant policy considerations such as “dual-apartment” housing for elderly parents neighboring directly with their children, which may result in a win-win outcome for both generations in facing the serious challenges of population and household aging. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Divorce Rate; Hebei Province; Household Type; Housing Unit; Real Estate","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18772560","","","","English","Springer.

While this practice is straightforward in linear mixed models, it is less so in generalized linear mixed models. Using both an empirical example and synthetic data, we show that the coefficient of Group-by-Time product terms in a specific class of mixed models-mixed Poisson models for count outcome variables-estimates the group difference in slope as the multiplicative change with respect to the baseline rates, not differences in the predicted rate of change between groups. The latter can be obtained from computing the marginal effect for the expected response with respect to time by group following model estimation.

Two approaches dominate this controversy. One originates in the criminal careers paradigm, which emphasizes a potential heterogeneity of offending groups in the general population-thus leading to a distinction between incidence and prevalence of criminal offending, a focus on the onset, persistence, and desistence of criminal careers, and the possibility that criminals are a distinctive group with constant high rates of offending. Another approach places criminal events within a broader context of studies of the life course by explicitly substituting the conceptualization of ""social events"" for that of ""criminal careers."" With respect to analytical models, this approach emphasizes a poten- . tial heterogeneity of offenders with respect to order of criminal events from first to second to higher orders and thus suggests an analysis of the ""risks"" or ""hazards"" of offending by order of offense. Some extant commentaries on the criminal careers and life course approaches to conceptualizing and modeling longitudinal sequences of delinquent and criminal events committed by individuals have emphasized their differences and incompatibilities. In contrast, we apply recently developed semiparametric mixed Poisson regression techniques to develop conditions under which the two conceptual/modeling approaches are formally equivalent. We also modify the semiparametric mixed Poisson regression model of criminal careers to incorporate information on order of the delinquent/criminal event and develop an empirical application. This modification demonstrates the complementarity of the criminal careers and life course approaches, even though they have somewhat different foci. © 2005 Shawn Bushway and David Weisburd.","Criminal careers; Hazards models; Poisson models; Studies of the life course","","","","","","","","Allison P.D., Discrete-time methods for the analysis of event histories, Social.

Yet, when the gamma scale parameter, ν, is parameterized, there is no direct algorithmic solution to the Fisher Information matrix of the associated heterogeneous negative binomial regression, which seriously limits its applications to a wide range of complex problems. In this research, we propose a numerical method to calculate the Fisher information of heterogeneous negative binomial regression and accordingly develop a preliminary framework for analyzing incomplete counts with overdispersion.

The state-level CWIs are composed of 25 state-level indicators clustered into seven different domains or dimensions of child well-being. In addition to examining state rankings and the inter-relationship among domains across states, statistics on 27 demographic, economic, and policy characteristics of the states are analyzed in a regression analysis with respect to their ability to explain state differences in the CWIs. Because of the large number of explanatory variables and the potential redundancy created thereby, a principal components analysis/composite index method is applied. This leads to three composite indices that simplify the regressor space and explain 66.0 % of the variance. A second regression that adds three key policy measures to the three structural indices explains 79.5 % of the variance. Key findings of the study pertaining to how the resources available to children provided by families, communities, and the public sector relate to child well-being are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Child well-being; Composite index; Variability among U.S. states","","","","","","Foundation for Child Development, FCD","This research is based on work supported Foundation for Child Development.","Becker G.S., Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis with Special Reference to Education, (1975); Ben-Arieh A., Frones I., Editorial: Indicators of children's well being - Concepts, indices and usage, Social Indicators Research, 80, pp. 1-4, (2007); Billen P., Boyd D., Dadayan L., Gais T., State Funding for Children: Spending in 2004 and How It Changed from Earlier Years, (2007); Bradshaw J., Richardson D., An index of child well-being in Europe, Child Indicators Research, 2, pp. 319-351, (2009); Brown B.V., Botsko C., A Guide to State and Local-level Indicators of Child Well-being Available Through the Federal Statistical System.

In order to understand the methodologies utilized in the construction of indices of overall child well-being, one must first consider the specific theoretical perspectives or motivations for studying child well-being. Such perspectives and motivations highly influence the methodologies used to measure and define overall child well-being.

The roles of such variants in life span regulation remain unclear. Data and Method: A biodemographic analyses was done of genetic regulation of life span using data on low-significance longevity alleles selected in the earlier GWAS of the original Framingham cohort. Results: Age-specific survival curves considered as functions of the number of longevity alleles exhibit regularities known in demography as ""rectangularization"" of survival curves. The presence of such pattern confirms observations from experimental studies that regulation of life span involves genes responsible for stress resistance. Conclusion: Biodemographic analyses could provide important information about the properties of genes affecting phenotypic traits. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.","","Aging; Alleles; Cohort Studies;

Because almost all U.S. residents aged 65+ years old are covered by the Medicare system, prediction of future Medicare costs is crucial for health care planning. These costs represent the sum of the medical costs associated with every person enrolled in the system. Individual costs deal with expenditures associated with disease onsets, their treatment, and subsequent causes of acute and chronic conditions. In this Chapter, we analyze time trajectories of medical costs associated with the onset of 12 aging-related conditions: acute coronary heart disease, stroke, ulcer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, asthma, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. These trajectories were reconstructed using the NLTCS data linked to the Medicare Files of Service Use (NLTCS-M). We developed a special procedure for selecting individuals with onset of each geriatric disease and used it for identification of the date of the disease onset. We found that the time patterns of medical cost trajectories are similar for all studied diseases. These patterns can be described in terms of four components representing: (i) the cost associated with initial comorbidity (reflected in medical expenditures); (ii) the cost of the onset of each disease; (iii) the rate of decline in medical costs due to recovery, reflecting a reduction of medical expenditures after disease onset; and (iv) an acquired comorbidity characterizing the steady-state of medical costs after disease onset. The description of the trajectories was formalized by a model that explicitly involves four parameters reflecting these four components of the medical cost trajectories. The four components were evaluated for the entire U.S. population as well as for the subpopulation conditional on age, disability, and comorbidity states, and survival for 2.5 years after the date of the disease onset. The approach developed results in a family of new forecasting models with covariates. The properties of Medicare expenditures for older U.S. adults revealed in these analyses contribute to an understanding of the impacts of screening effectiveness and therapeutic innovations on the dynamics of disease incidence with advancing age as well as for projecting future Medicare costs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cost Level; Disease Onset; Medical Cost; Medicare Data; Rand Corporation","","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG027019, R01AG030198, R01AG030612, R01AG032319, R01AG046860); National Institute on Aging, NIA","Acknowledgements The research reported in this chapter was supported by the National Institute on Aging grants R01AG027019, R01AG030612, R01AG030198, R01AG032319, and R01AG046860.","Akushevich I., Kulminski A., Manton K., Life tables with covariates: Dynamic model for nonlinear analysis of longitudinal data, Mathematical Population Studies, 12, 2, pp. 51-80, (2005); Akushevich I., Kravchenko J., Akushevich L., Ukraintseva S., Arbeev K., Yashin A., Cancer risk and behavioral factors, comorbidities, and functional status in the U.S. elderly population, ISRN Oncology 2011:Article ID, (2011); Akushevich I., Kravchenko J., Akushevich L., Ukraintseva S., Arbeev K., Yashin A.I., Medical cost trajectories and onsets of cancer and noncancer diseases in U.S. elderly population, Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 2011:Article ID, (2011); Akushevich I., Kravchenko J., Ukraintseva S., Arbeev K., Yashin A.I., Age patterns of incidence of geriatric disease in the U.S. elderly population: Medicare-based analysis, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 60, 2, pp. 323-327, (2012); Akushevich I., Kravchenko J., Ukraintseva S., Arbeev K., Yashin A.I., Circulatory diseases in the U.S. Elderly in the linked national long-term care survey-medicare database: Population-based analysis of incidence, comorbidity, and disability, Research on Aging, 35, 4, pp. 437-458, (2013); Akushevich I., Kravchenko J., Ukraintseva S., Arbeev K., Yashin A.I., Recovery and survival from aging-associated diseases, Experimental Gerontology, 48, 8, pp. 824-830, (2013); Consumer Price Index, (2009); The burden of chronic diseases and their risk factors, Atlanta: US Department of Health and Human Services, (2004); Charlson M.E., Pompei P., Ales K.L., Mackenzie C.R., A new method of classifying prognostic co-morbidity in longitudinal-studies – development and validation, Journal of Chronic Diseases, 40, 5, pp. 373-383, (1987); de Groot V., Beckerman H., Lankhorst G.J., Bouter L.M., How to measure comorbidity: A critical review of available methods, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 56, 3, pp. 221-229, (2003); Forthman M.T., Dove H.G., Wooster L.D., Episode Treatment Groups (ETGs): A patient classification system for measuring outcomes performance by episode of illness, Topics in Health Information Management, 21, 2, pp. 51-61, (2000); Goldman D.P., Corporation R., Health status and medical treatment of the future elderly: Final report, Santa Monica: RAND, (2004); Goldman D.P., Shang B., Bhattacharya J., Garber A.M., Hurd M., Joyce G.F., Lakdawalla D.N., Panis C., Shekelle P.G., Consequences of Health Trends and Medical Innovation for the Future Elderly, (2005); Goldman D.P., Zheng Y.H., Girosi F., Michaud P.C., Olshansky S.J., Cutler D., Rowe J.W., The benefits of risk factor prevention in americans aged 51 years and older, American Journal of Public Health, 99, 11, pp. 2096-2101, (2009); (2009); 2010 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, (2010); Klees B.S., Wolfe C.J., Curtis C.A., Brief summaries of medicare and medicaid, Health Care Financing Review/2009 Statistical Supplement, (2009); Lubitz J., Health, technology, and medical care spending.

Although high social and political costs were paid, the demographic dividend contributed significantly to China’s economic boom in the past 20 years. However, this dividend will disappear in a couple of decades (Cai 2006; Wang and Mason 2006), producing many questions about China’s future. What will the social and economic consequences be if China continues to implement its current strict fertility control policy? Is it necessary to change the current fertility policy? If so, what are the optimistic and feasible options? This chapter addresses these important questions with an application of the ProFamy extended cohort-component method. The unique features of this study include a comparative analysis of possible options for fertility policy transition based on demographic projections of population aging, households and elderly living arrangements, dependency ratios, pension deficits, labor force supply, the marriage squeeze, and economic costs under different fertility policy scenarios. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Demographic Dividend; Fertility Policy; Marriage Squeeze; Policy Scenario; Total Fertility Rate","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18772560","","","","English","Springer.

This assumption often is violated in empirical applications. Various methods for evaluating the extent of such violations and for adjusting the estimated model parameters if necessary are generally available in books on regression methodology. Recent developments in statistics have taken a different approach by examining the data to ascertain whether the estimated heteroscedastic residuals (from a first-stage regression model of the conditional mean of an outcome variable as a function of a set of explanatory variables or covariates) are themselves systematically related to a set of explanatory variables in a second-stage regression. These extensions of the conventional models have been given various names but, most generally, are heteroscedastic regression models (HRMs). Instead of treating heteroscedasticity as a nuisance to be adjusted out of existence to reduce or eliminate its impact on regression model parameter estimates, the basic idea of HRMs is to model the heteroscedasticity itself. This chapter systematically reviews the specification of HRMs in both linear and generalized linear model forms, describes methods of estimation of such models, and reports empirical applications of the models to data on changes over recent decades in the US income distribution and in self-reported health/health disparities. A concluding section points to similarities and complementarities of the goals of the counterfactual approach to causal inference and heteroscedastic regression models. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Double Hierarchical Generalize Linear Model;

We found that complete random-combinations of TFR(t) and e0(t) would result in about 24% and 22.2% of improbable combinations in probabilistic population projections (PPPs) for developing and developed countries, respectively, namely, high (or low) TFR(t) combined with high (or low) female e0(t). Thus, we propose optimized random-combinations of probabilistically projected TFR(t) and e0(t) for PPPs, and we use different strategies of the optimized randomcombinations across developing and developed countries due to different empirical patterns observed. As illustrative applications, we conducted PPPs for 11 developing countries (Brazil, China, Indonesia, Madagascar, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Viet Nam), and 6 developed countries (Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States), using our proposed optimized random-combinations of probabilistically projected TFR(t) and e0(t). We found that optimized random-combinations largely reduce percentages of improbable combinations of TFR(t) and e0(t) and substantially narrow the prediction intervals width compared to complete random-combinations in both developing countries and developed countries. This is important in a real-world practical sense since it would substantially improve the accuracy of PPPs, which are useful for socioeconomic planning. The present study is part of our ongoing research program on probabilistic households and living arrangement projections (PHPs) that builds upon and is consistent with the UNPD PPPs. The PHPs are useful for various studies of healthy aging and sustainable development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Complete random-combinations; Correlations between total fertility rates and life expectations at birth; Optimized random-combinations; Probabilistic households and living arrangement projections; Probabilistic population projections","","","","","","","","Alesina A.F., Giuliano P., Divorce, fertility and the value of marriage., (2007); Alkema L., Gerland P., Raftery A., Wilmoth J., The United Nations probabilistic population projections: an introduction to demographic forecasting with uncertainty, Foresight (Colchester, Vt.), 2015, (2015); Alkema L., Raftery A.E., Gerland P., Clark S.J., Pelletier F., Buettner T., Heilig G.K., Probabilistic projections of the total fertility rate for all countries, Demography, 48, 3, pp. 815-839, (2011); Aughinbaugh A., Robles O., Sun H., Marriage and divorce: Patterns by gender, race, and educational attainment, Monthly Lab.

Reversing the spectrum of this question, it becomes “Are the kids suffering?” Adults might be able to answer these questions for their own children or those in their immediate surroundings, and many children could provide information about their own well-being and suffering (or those of other children). However, applied to large populations of children at the national and cross-national levels, well-being and suffering questions are more challenging. This conundrum has stimulated the rapid development of child well-being indicators. This chapter reviews the objective and subjective approaches to measuring well-being, describing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and how it has been used in cross-national studies of child well-being. We then report some descriptive international comparisons of country-specific indicators of child suffering in relation to corresponding values of the Human Development Index and what these tell us against one another. We conclude with future directions for necessary developments to advance the global monitoring of child suffering. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Child suffering; Child well-being; Convention of the rights of the child; Human development index; Quality of life","","","","","","","","Anderson R.E., Human Suffering and Quality of Life Conceptualizing Stories and Statistics, (2014); Ben-Arieh A., Where are the children?

This chapter employs the ProFamy extended cohort-component method to project household vehicle consumption from 2000 to 2025 across four regions of the United States (the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). The results show that the total number of household vehicles (The term “household vehicles” refers to vehicles for household use in this book) in 2025 will reach 235 million, representing a 31% increase over 25 years. About a half of the increase is due to the consumption of cars, while the household consumption of vans will increase at a faster rate than that of cars and trucks. Household vehicle consumption will grow more in white non-Hispanic and Hispanic households in comparison with black non-Hispanic and Asian and other non-Hispanic households. Owners of household vehicles in the United States will be aging quickly. Among households of different sizes, the largest increase in household vehicles will come from two-person households. Across the four regions, the largest increase in household vehicle consumption will be in the South, followed by the West, Midwest, and Northeast. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cumulative Increase; Household Income Category; Household Vehicle; National Household Travel Survey; Ownership Rate","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18772560","","","","English","Springer.

In most countries, the extension of lifespan is associated with a transition from a long historical period of high fertility and high mortality (particularly infant mortality (Singh and Yu 1995)) to low fertility and low mortality. This demographic trend leads to rapidly growing populations of the elderly (e.g., the United Nations projects a nearly twofold increase in the proportion of the 60+ population from about 10–21 % over the next five decades (UN 2007)) which raises serious concerns about a possible accompanying expansion of morbidity and disability, especially in developed countries (Olshansky et al. 2007; Robine 2003; Sierra et al. 2009). Because morbidity is in a causative pathway to disability (Verbrugge and Jette 1994), reducing the burden of morbidity could lead to compression of years of unhealthy life. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS); Healthspan; Kulminski; United Nations Projections; Yashin","","","","","","","","Akushevich I., Kravchenko J., Ukraintseva S., Arbeev K., Yashin A.I., Age patterns of incidence of geriatric disease in the U.S. elderly population: Medicare-based analysis, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 60, 2, pp. 323-327, (2012); Alexander D.M., Williams L.M., Gatt J.M., Dobson-Stone C., Kuan S.A., Todd E.G., Schofield P.R., Cooper N.J., Gordon E., The contribution of apolipoprotein E alleles on cognitive performance and dynamic neural activity over six decades, Biological Psychology, 75, 3, pp. 229-238, (2007); Arbeev K.G., Akushevich I., Kulminski A.M., Arbeeva L.S., Akushevich L., Ukraintseva S.V., Culminskaya I.V., Yashin A.I., Genetic model for longitudinal studies of aging, health, and longevity and its potential application to incomplete data, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 258, 1, pp. 103-111, (2009); Arbeev K.G., Ukraintseva S.V., Arbeeva L.S., Akushevich I., Kulminski A.M., Yashin A.I., Evaluation of genotype-specific survival using joint analysis of genetic and non-genetic subsamples of longitudinal data, Biogerontology, 12, 2, pp. 157-166, (2011); Atzmon G., Rincon M., Schechter C.B., Shuldiner A.R., Lipton R.B., Bergman A., Barzilai N., Lipoprotein genotype and conserved pathway for exceptional longevity in humans, Plos Biology, 4, 4, (2006); Barnes J.A., Dix D.J., Collins B.W., Luft C., Allen J.W., Expression of inducible Hsp70 enhances the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and protects against the cytotoxic effects of hyperthermia, Cell Stress & Chaperones, 6, 4, pp. 316-325, (2001); Barzilai N., Atzmon G., Schechter C., Schaefer E.J., Cupples A.L., Lipton R., Cheng S., Shuldiner A.R., Unique lipoprotein phenotype and genotype associated with exceptional longevity, JAMA, 290, 15, pp. 2030-2040, (2003); Beekman M., Nederstigt C., Suchiman H.E., Kremer D., van der Breggen R., Lakenberg N., Alemayehu W.G., de Craen A.J., Westendorp R.G., Boomsma D.I., de Geus E.J., Houwing-Duistermaat J.J., Heijmans B.T., Slagboom P.E., Genome-wide association study (GWAS)-identified disease risk alleles do not compromise human longevity, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, 42, pp. 18046-18049, (2010); Bergman A., Atzmon G., Ye K., Maccarthy T., Barzilai N., Buffering mechanisms in aging: A systems approach toward uncovering the genetic component of aging, Plos Computational Biology, 3, 8, (2007); Brown W.M., Beck S.R., Lange E.M., Davis C.C., Kay C.M., Langefeld C.D., Rich S.S., Age-stratified heritability estimation in the Framingham Heart Study families, BMC Genetics, 4, (2003); Corella D., Ordovas J.M., Aging and cardiovascular diseases: The role of gene-diet interactions, Ageing Research Reviews, 18, pp. 53-73, (2014); Cournil A., Kirkwood T.B., If you would live long, choose your parents well, Trends in Genetics, 17, 5, pp. 233-235, (2001); de Benedictis G., Carotenuto L., Carrieri G., de Luca M., Falcone E., Rose G., Yashin A.I., Bonafe M., Franceschi C., Age-related changes of the 3<sup>0</sup> APOB-VNTR genotype pool in ageing cohorts, Annals of Human Genetics, 62, 2, pp. 115-122, (1998); Deelen J., Beekman M., Uh H.W., Helmer Q., Kuningas M., Christiansen L., Kremer D., van der Breggen R., Suchiman H.E., Lakenberg N., van den Akker E.B., Passtoors W.M., Tiemeier H., van Heemst D., de Craen A.J., Rivadeneira F., de Geus E.J., Perola M., van der Ouderaa F.J., Gunn D.A., Boomsma D.I., Uitterlinden A.G., Christensen K., van Duijn C.M., Heijmans B.T., Houwing-Duistermaat J.J., Westendorp R.G., Slagboom P.E., Genome-wide association study identifies a single major locus contributing to survival into old age; the APOE locus revisited, Aging Cell, 10, 4, pp. 686-698, (2011); Eichler E.E., Flint J., Gibson G., Kong A., Leal S.M., Moore J.H., Nadeau J.H., Missing heritability and strategies for finding the underlying causes of complex disease, Nature Reviews Genetics, 11, 6, pp. 446-450, (2010); Evert J., Lawler E., Bogan H., Perls T., Morbidity profiles of centenarians: Survivors, delayers, and escapers, The Journals of Gerontology.

Within the context of the theory of models, we then turn to the question of scalability of composite indices, that is: Can properties of a society, such as composite indices, be scaled across time periods and levels of analysis – from the whole system to subunits thereof? Because societies are considered complex systems, indeed among the most complex, we address this question within the context of two general sets of equations of state for complex systems. The first complexity model is a nonlinear deterministic dynamics model defined by difference or differential equations. A second complexity model incorporates stochastic (uncertainty) elements into the model specifications, leading to the various classes of statistical models that we use in our daily research. As a case study of the use of composite social indicators, the U.S. Child and Youth Well-Being Index (CWI) and various empirical findings for the years 1975–2014 are reviewed. Using the CWI as an example, the question of whether the scalability of composite social indicators is more likely due to one of the complexity models or the other is addressed. We conclude that both complexity models appear to be applicable and useful for studying, interpreting, and scaling composite indicators. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","","","","","","","","Casti J.L., Reality Rules I: Picturing the World in Mathematics – the Fundamentals, (1992); Casti J.L., Reality Rules II: Picturing the World in Mathematics – the Frontier, (1992); Cox D.R., Miller H.D., The Theory of Stochastic Processes, (1965); Gleick J., Chaos: Making a New Science, (1987); Gorski P.S., The poverty of deductivism: A constructive realist model of sociological explanations, Sociological Methodology, 34, pp. 1-34, (2004); Hagerty M.R., Land K.C., Constructing summary indices of quality of life: A model for the effect of heterogeneous importance weights, Sociological Methods and Research, 35, May, pp. 455-496, (2007); Higuchi T., Approach to an irregular time series on the basis of the fractal theory, Physica D, 31, pp. 277-283, (1988); Land K.C., Models and indicators, Social Forces, 80, December, pp. 381-410, (2001); Land K.C., Special Focus Report: Trends in Infancy/Early Childhood and Middle Childhood Well-Being, 1994–2006, (2008); Land K.C., The Well-Being of America’s Children: Developing and Improving the Child and Youth Well-Being Index, (2012); Land K.C., Duke Child and Youth Well-Being Index (CWI) Report 2015, (2015); Land K.C., Social indicators, Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology, (2015); Land K.C., Lamb V.L., Mustillo S.K., Child and youth well-being in the United States, 1975–1998: Some findings from a new index, Social Indicators Research, 56, December, pp. 241-320, (2001); Land K.C., Lamb V.L., Meadows S.O., Taylor A., Measuring trends in child well-being: An evidence-based approach, Social Indicators Research, 80, pp. 105-132, (2007); Land K.C., Lamb V.L., Meadows S., Zheng H., Fu Q., The CWI and its components: Empirical studies and findings, The Well-Being of America’s Children: Developing and Improving the Child and Youth Well-Being Index, (2012); Lee J., Lamb V.L., Land K.C., Composite indices of changes in child and youth well-being in the San Francisco Bay Area and the state of California, 1995–2005, Child Indicators Research, 2, December, pp. 353-374, (2009); Lorentz E., Deterministic non-periodic flows, Journal of Atmospheric Science, 20, pp. 130-141, (1963); Suppe F., The Semantic Conception of Theories and Scientific Realism, (1989); Toynbee A.J., A Study of History, (1961)","K.C.

First, we develop a statistical algorithm for estimating, for each school year, the exposure probability (likelihood or risk of being victimized) and intensity rate (rate of victimization among those exposed to the risk of being victimized) parameters of zero-inflated Poisson models of truncated and combined self-reported victimization frequency data for the four forms of violent bullying. Estimates of both the exposure to, and intensity of, the self-reported frequencies for each the four forms for each of the grades show increases into the middle part of the 2000–2010 decade with slight declines in the years 2008–2012. Exceptions are found for intensity rates of threats without injury and threats with a weapon among 12th graders. Second, age-period-cohort analysis was applied to the estimated exposure and intensity parameters of violent bullying victimization. This analysis reveals: (1) that both the exposure probabilities and intensity rates decrease from the 8th (typically 13–14 year olds) to the 10th (typically 15–16 year olds) to the 12grades (typically 17–18 years old); (2) that the school years 2006 to 2012 were associated with decreases in time period exposure probabilities and increases in intensity rates - fewer students victimized per school year but those who are victimized are victimized more frequently; and (3) that birth cohorts born since the late-1980s had decreases in intensity rates, but their exposure probabilities increased until the most recent (1995–1996) cohorts for which the exposure probabilities have stabilized or declined. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Age-period-cohort analysis; Victimization; Violent bullying at school; Zero-inflated Poisson models","","","","","","Foundation for Child Development, FCD","This research was supported by research grants from the Foundation for Child Development.

The chapter focused on how changes in household structure and living arrangements may affect future home-based care costs for disabled elders based on census micro datasets, the National Long Term Care Survey data and the ProFamy extended cohort-component method. The results showed a remarkable acceleration in numbers of disabled elderly aged 65+ after 2020 with a much faster increase in disabled oldest-old aged 80+, such that after 2030 they outnumber the disabled young-old aged 65–79. Increases in yearly workdays and payments of home-based care for disabled elders will dramatically accelerate after 2020, especially for the disabled oldest-old. We also discussed similarities and differentials across racial groups and genders and the policy implications of future trends in home-based care needs and costs for disabled elderly. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Annual Growth Rate; Living Arrangement; Male Elder; Racial Differential; Service Prex","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18772560","","","","English","Springer.

The risks of these phenotypes expressed in forms of pathological dysregulation of physiological functions, incidence or prevalence of diseases, case fatality, or mortality also change with age. This change integrates all challenges occurring in a human organism during the life course by a given age.

Historically, demographers used population level data to compute measures of the key components of population change: fertility, mortality, and migration. However, the field has expanded considerably over the last half century to include predictors and consequences of demographic change. Sample data is now commonly used by demographers, and statistical methods are commonly used in conjunction with mathematical methods. In this chapter, we define key mathematical concepts that form the basis for historical and contemporary demographic analyses, including the population balancing equation and rates. We discuss the single decrement life table and its extensions to multiple decrements and multiple living states. Next, we discuss the stationary population theory that underlies life table computations and show its extension to stable and nonstable populations. Finally, we discuss several topics of contemporary concern, including population momentum, household projection methods, quantum and tempo adjustments, and methods for cohort analysis. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Age-period-cohort methods; Demographic rate; Hazard rate; Multiple-decrement life table; Multistate household projections; Multistate life table; Nonstable population theory; Population balancing equation; Single-decrement life table; Stable population theory; Stationary population; Sullivan’s method; Survivor function","","","","","","","","Arias E., Heron M., Xu J.Q., United States life tables, 2014, National Vital Statistics Reports 66(4), (2017); Bean F.D., The Baby Boom and its explanations, The Sociological Quarterly, 24, 3, pp. 353-365, (1983); Bell M., Cooper J., Household forecasting: Replacing the headship rate model.

Many adults might be able to answer the question for their own children or those in their immediate surroundings, and many children may provide information about their own wellbeing or those of other children. However, applied to large populations of children at the national and cross-nationallevels, questions of this genre are more challenging and have stimulated the rapid development of studies of child wellbeing in recent decades. This chapter reviews the objective and subjective approaches to measuring child wellbeing, describes the roots of this field in the social indicators movement of the 1960s and 1970s, outlines the conceptual and methodological development of child wellbeing research, and summarizes empirical findings from several major national and cross-nationalstudies of child wellbeing. The chapter concludes with future directions and needed conceptual and data developments to advance the global monitoring of child wellbeing. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","","","","","","","","","Ben-Arieh A., (, Social Indicators Research, 74, pp. 573-596, (2005); Ben-Arieh A., Is the study of the “State of our children” changing?

It then describes how the Child and Youth Well-Being Index (CWI) has used the results of subjective well-being studies to inform the selection of time series of Key Indicators - demographic, social, and economic statistics - in the construction of the CWI. The CWI and its seven major components/domains of well-being have been calculated annually for the United States as a whole and used to monitor changes in the well-being of America’s children for the years 1975-2013. The Index also has also been calculated separately for U.S. children and youth classified by gender, race/ethnicity, the 50 U.S. states, and selected geographical sub-regions within the states. Empirical findings from the calculations of the national CWI are described. Reversing the spectrum of the well-being question that motivates the CWI “How are the kids doing?” leads to the question “Are the kids suffering?” The second part of this chapter describes recent work on the conceptualization, construction, and calculation of a Child and Youth Suffering Index (CSI) to measure trends in levels of suffering of America’s children and youth. The chapter finishes with a comparison of empirical findings from the CSI and CWI and how the two indices complement each other. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Changes in child well-being over time; Child and Youth Well-Being Index (CWI); Child Suffering Index (CSI); Children’s well-being; Comparing changes in child well-being and child suffering over time; Objective social indicators; Social indicators; Subjective well-being indicators","","","","","","","","Anderson R.E., Human Suffering and Quality of Life: Conceptualizing Stories and Statistics, (2014); Andrews F.M., Withey S.B., Social Indicators of Well-Being: Americans’ Perceptions of Life Quality, (1976); Ben-Arieh A., Where are the children?

In this chapter, we describe an approach to statistical analyses of longitudinal data based on the use of stochastic process models of human aging, health, and longevity. An important advantage of this approach is the possibility of incorporating state of the art advances in aging research into the model structure and then use this model in statistical estimation procedures. Specifically, to describe changes due to aging, the model incorporates variables characterizing resistance to stresses, adaptive capacity, and “optimal” (normal) physiological states. To capture the effects of exposure to persistent external disturbances, variables describing effects of allostatic adaptation and allostatic load are also introduced into the model. These variables facilitate the description of linkages between aging-related changes in physiological indices and morbidity and mortality risks. The model is tested in simulation experiments and applied to the analyses of Framingham Heart Study data. The results of these analyses provide researchers with a convenient conceptual framework for studying dynamic aspects of aging, and with an appropriate tool for systematically organizing and analyzing information about aging and its connection with health and longevity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptive Capacity; Allostatic Load; Mortality Curve; Ordinary Differential Equation; Physiological Index","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA","Funding text 1: The chapter was partially supported by grants, R01AG046860, P01AG043352, and P30AG034424 from the National Institute on Aging.

Recently, a new class of APC methods based on modern statistical knowledge has emerged, offering potential solutions. In 2009, Reither, Hauser and Yang used one of these new methods - hierarchical APC (HAPC) modeling - to study how birth cohorts may have contributed to the U.S. obesity epidemic. They found that recent birth cohorts experience higher odds of obesity than their predecessors, but that ubiquitous period-based changes are primarily responsible for the rising prevalence of obesity. Although these findings have been replicated elsewhere, recent commentaries by Bell and Jones call them into question - along with the new class of APC methods. Specifically, Bell and Jones claim that new APC methods do not adequately address model identification and suggest that ""solid theory"" is often sufficient to remove one of the three temporal dimensions from empirical consideration. They also present a series of simulation models that purportedly show how the HAPC models estimated by Reither etal. (2009) could have produced misleading results. However, these simulation models rest on assumptions that there were no period effects, and associations between period and cohort variables and the outcome were perfectly linear. Those are conditions under which APC models should never be used. Under more tenable assumptions, our own simulations show that HAPC methods perform well, both in recovering the main findings presented by Reither etal. (2009) and the results reported by Bell and Jones. We also respond to critiques about model identification and theoretically-imposed constraints, finding little pragmatic support for such arguments. We conclude by encouraging social scientists to move beyond the debates of the 1970s and toward a deeper appreciation for modern APC methodologies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Age-period-cohort models; Body mass index; Cohort effects; Hierarchical modeling; Obesity epidemic; Random effects; Research methods; Social change","Cohort Effect; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Models, Statistical; Obesity; Research Design; Social Change; United States; age; body mass; cohort analysis; epidemiology; obesity; research method; simulation; social change; age period cohort study; Article; birth rate; body mass; change theory; cohort analysis; epidemic; feasibility study; hierarchical age period cohort model; human; obesity; problem identification; process model; social change; social psychology; statistical model; epidemiology; female; health disparity; male; methodology; obesity; statistical model","","","","","University Cancer Research Funds; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R24HD066613); National Institute on Aging, NIA, (K01AG036745); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD050924); Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, UAES, (R24 HD066613); University of Colorado Boulder; University of North Carolina Wilmington, UNCW; Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CPC, (R24 HD050924)","This research is supported by the National Institute of Aging (Grant K01AG036745 ) and University Cancer Research Funds at the Lineberger Cancer Center.

I show how standard classes of formalisms used to construct models in contemporary sociology can be derived from the general theory of models. This demonstrates, at a high level of abstraction, the isomorphism of many formal sociological models to the formal models used in virtually every scientific discipline today. I also review recent model-building and model-evaluation efforts in which I have participated on the estimation of active life expectancy of the U.S. elderly population, an assessment of the robustness of a recently proposed adjusted total fertility rate, and the construction of a new index of child and youth well-being. These studies show how formal models help us to see patterns in data that otherwise are not detectable, improve social measurement, and, in particular, define and interpret social indicators.","","","","","","","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4, (1994); Andrews F.M., Withey S.B., Social Indicators of Well-being: Americans' Perceptions of Life Quality, (1976); Blalock H.M.

Distinct latent classes of individuals within various samples have been identified based upon the similarity of individuals with respect to their rate of offending across the teen and adult years, not of the effects of other regressors. In previous research on samples of males taken from the cities of London and Philadelphia, four and five such categories have been identified respectively, ranging from a group of nonoffenders to a group of chronic offenders. However, the question of whether similar findings hold for females has not been adequately addressed, in part due to the scarcity of longitudinal samples with sizable female populations. Data from the Second Philadelphia Cohort are used to address this and related questions. First, are there latent classes of female offenders? Second, if such categories do exist, how do they compare? Third, how do classes of male and female offenders compare on key measures of criminal careers? Analyses of the samples yield differing numbers of classes for males and females. Gender invariances as well as differences in patterns of offending are also found and are discussed.","Age-crime curve; Categories of offenders; Latent class analysis; Sex differences in offending","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (SBR-11490)","1The research reported here was supported, in part, by National Science Foundation Grant SBR-11490. 2Department of Sociology, Emory University, 1555 Pierce Drive, Atlanta, GA 30322.

We analyzed the association between self-reported arthritis and mortality in the U.S. elderly disabled and non-disabled individuals using unique disability-focused data from the large-scale population-based National Long Term Care Survey. It was found that males and females who reported arthritis/rheumatism have, generally, smaller risks of death than those who did not report those conditions. This inverse relationship is more pronounced in disabled individuals. This finding holds for both short-term (relative risk [RR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75-0.88 for males and RR = 0.76; CI = 0.71-0.82 for females) and long-term follow-ups (RR = 0.82; CI = 0.78-0.87 for males and RR = 0.83; CI = 0.79-0.87 for females). For females, this effect is age insensitive, while for males it is limited to ages below 85. Demographic and 19 major self-reported geriatric conditions have trivial effect on these risks, supporting the view that a better survival of diseased individuals can be attributed to the effects of medical treatment. Given the widespread prevalence of arthritis/rheumatism and disability in elderly populations and the increasing population of the elderly, these findings call for comprehensive analyses of factors driving better survival and medical costs associated with extended lives. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Aged; Arthritis; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Disabled Persons; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Prevalence; Self Disclosure; Sex Factors; United States; aged; article; controlled study; disability; elderly care; female; follow up; health survey; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; mortality; prevalence; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; self report","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG027019)","","Davenport G., Rheumatology and musculoskeletal medicine, Br J Gen Pract, 54, pp. 457-464, (2004); Felson D.T., Lawrence R.C., Dieppe P.A., Hirsch R., Helmick C.G., Jordan J.M., Kington R.S., Lane N.E., Nevitt M.C., Zhang Y., Sowers M., McAlindon T., Spector T.D., Poole A.R., Yanovski S.Z., Ateshian G., Sharma L., Buckwalter J.A., Brandt K.D., Fries J.F., Osteoarthritis: New insights.

This study seeks to determine whether a relationship exists between adult erotic dance clubs and negative secondary effects in the form of increased numbers of crimes reported in the areas surrounding the adult businesses, in Charlotte, North Carolina. For each of 20 businesses, a control site (matched on the basis of demographic characteristics related to crime risk) is compared for crime events over the period of three years (1998-2000) using data on crime incidents reported to the police. We find that the presence of an adult nightclub does not increase the number of crime incidents reported in localized areas surrounding the club (defined by circular areas of 500- and 1,000-foot radii) as compared to the number of crime incidents reported in comparable localized areas that do not contain such an adult business. Indeed, the analyses imply the opposite, namely, that the nearby areas surrounding the adult business sites have smaller numbers of reported crime incidents than do corresponding areas surrounding the three control sites studied. These findings are interpreted in terms of the business mandates of profitability and continuity of existence of the businesses.","","","","","","","","","Babbie E., The Basics of Social Research, (1999); Campbell D.T., Stanley J.C., Experimental and Quasi-experimental Designs for Research, (1963); Cohen L.E., Felson M., Social Change and Crime Rate Trends: A Routine Activity Approach, American Sociological Rev., 44, pp. 588-608, (1979); Cohen J., Gorr W., Olligschlaeger A., Modeling Street-level Illicit Drug Markets, (1993); Cohen L.E., Kluegel J.R., Land K.C., Social Inequality and Predatory Criminal Victimization: An Exposition and Test of a Formal Theory, American Sociological Rev., 46, pp. 505-524, (1981); Davidson R., McKinnon J.G., Estimation and Inference in Econometrics, (1993); Duffala D.C., Convenience Stores, Armed Robbery, and Physical Environmental Features, American Behavioral Scientist, 20, pp. 227-246, (1976); Engstad P.A., Environmental Opportunities and the Ecology of Crime, Crime in Canadian Society, (1975); Study of Calls for Service to Adult Entertainment Establishments Which Serve Alcoholic Beverages, January 1995-May 1997, (1997); Hanna J.L., Reality and Myth, What Neighbors Say about Exotic Dance Clubs: A Case Study in Charlotte, North Carolina, (2001); Hannan M.T., Young A.A., Estimation in Panel Models: Results on Pooling Cross-Sections and Time Series, Sociological Methodology, 1977, pp. 52-83, (1977); Hsiao C., Analysis of Panel Data: Econometric Society Monographs, (1986); Linz D., Paul B., Testing Assumptions Made by the Supreme Court Concerning the Negative Secondary Effects of Adult Businesses: A Quasi-Experimental Approach to a First Amendment Issue, 2002 International Communication Association, (2002); Long J.S., Ervin H., Correcting for Heteroskedasticity with Heteroskedasticity-Consistent Standard Errors in the Linear Regression Model: Small Sample Considerations, The American Statistician, 54, pp. 217-224, (2000); McKinnon J.G., White H., Some Heteroskedasticity-Consistent Covariance Matrix Estimators with Improved Finite Sample Properties, J. of Econometrics, 29, pp. 53-57, (1985); Miethe T.D., McDowall D., Contextual Effects in Models of Criminal Victimization, Social Forces, 71, pp. 741-759, (1993); Miethe T.D., Meier R.F., Crime and Its Social Context: Toward an Integrated Theory of Offenders, Victims, and Situations, (1994); Paul B., Linz D.G., Shafer B.J., Government Regulation of Adult Businesses Through Zoning and Anti-Nudity Ordinances: Debunking the Legal Myth of Negative Secondary Effects, Communications in Law & Policy, 6, pp. 355-392, (2001); Relation of Criminal Activity and Adult Businesses, (1979); Popper K., The Logic of Scientific Discovery, (1959); Roncek D.W., Maier P.A., Bars, Blocks, and Crimes Revisited: Linking the Theory of Routine Activities to the Empiricism of 'Hot Spots, Criminology, 29, pp. 725-753, (1991); Sherman L.W., Gartin P.R., Buerger M.E., Hot Spots of Preditory Crime: Routine Activities and the Criminology of Place, Criminology, 27, pp. 27-55, (1989); Singleton Jr. R.A., Straits B.C., Straits M.M., Approaches to Social Research, (1993); Smith W.R., Frazee S.G., Davison E.L., Furthering the Integration of Routine Activity and Social Disorganization Theories: Small Units of Analysis and the Study of Street Robbery as a Diffusion Process, Criminology, 38, pp. 489-524, (2000); Stark R., Deviant Places: A Theory of the Ecology of Crime, Criminology, 25, pp. 893-909, (1987); Crime in the United States, 1999, (2000); White H., A Heteroskedastic-Consistent Covariance Matrix and a Direct Test of Heteroskedasticity, Econometrica, 48, pp. 817-838, (1980)","D.

The proper statistical modeling of failure time data is an important analytical issue in sociology, but to date the field has largely neglected the application of these models to multiple failure time data in which the conventional assumption of the independence of failure times is not tenable. This paper critically describes a class of models known as variance-corrected proportional hazards models that have been developed by statisticians to take into account a lack of independence among failure times. The purpose is to provide an exposition and comparison for sociologists of several such models and associated methods for handling multiple failure time data that can be readily estimated in commonly available statistical software packages. We pay special attention to the data requirements necessary for estimation of the models. The paper concludes with an illustrative application of the models to analyze the arrest patterns of a sample of California Youth Authority parolees.","","","","","","","","","Aalen O.O., Nonparametric Inference for a Family of Counting Processes, Annals of Statistics, 6, pp. 701-726, (1978); Effects of Frailty in Survival Analysis, Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 3, pp. 221-243, (1994); Everitt B.S., Dunn G., Frailty Models, Statistical Analysis of Medical Data: New Developments, pp. 59-74, (1998); Aalen O.O., Husebeye E., Statistical Analysis of Repeated Events Forming Renewal Processes, Statistics in Medicine, 10, pp. 1227-1240, (1991); Aitkin M., Clayton D.G., The Fitting of Exponential, Weibull, and Extreme Value Distributions to Complex Survival Data Using GLIM, Applied Statistics, 32, pp. 165-171, (1980); Allison P.D., Discrete-Time Methods for the Analysis of Event Histories, Sociological Methodology, pp. 61-98, (1982); Event History Analysis, (1984); Survival Analysis Using the SAS System: A Practical Guide, (1995); Fixed-Effects Partial Likelihood for Repeated Events, Sociological Methods and Research, 25, pp. 207-222, (1996); Andersen P.K., Borgan O., Gill R.D., Keiding N., Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes, (1993); Andersen P.K., Gill R.D., Cox's Regression Model for Counting Processes: A Large Sample Study, Annals of Statistics, 10, pp. 1100-1120, (1982); Barai U., Teoh N., Multiple Statistics for Multiple Events, with Applications to Repeated Infections in the Growth Factor Studies, Statistics in Medicine, 16, pp. 941-949, (1997); Barlow W.E., Robust Variance Estimation for the Case-Cohort Design, Biometrics, 50, pp. 1064-1072, (1994); Bates G., Neyman J., Contributions to the Theory of Accident Proneness.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The main cohort of the CHS. PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand seven hundred twenty-one individuals. MEASUREMENTS: A phenotypic frailty index (PFI) was defined in the same way as proposed in the CHS: assessing weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, slowness, and poor grip strength. A cumulative deficit index (DI) was defined based on 48 elderly deficits (signs, symptoms, impairments, diseases) included in the index, with equal weights. RESULTS: Of the 1,073 frailest individuals with the lowest survival, the PFI, categorized as proposed in the CHS into robust, prefrail, and frail categories, underestimated the risk of death for 720 persons, whereas the DI categorized into the same three frailty categories underestimated the mortality risk for 134 persons. The higher power of the DI for discriminating frail individuals in their susceptibility to death also followed from comparison of quasi-instantaneous values of both indices. The three-level DI identified 219 individuals as frail of 361 individuals identified as frail according to the three-level PFI. CONCLUSION: The DI can more precisely evaluate chances of death because it assesses a broader spectrum of disorders than the PFI. Both indices appear to be frailty related. Integration of both approaches is highly promising for increasing the precision of discrimination of the risk of death and especially for identification of the most vulnerable elderly people. © 2008, Copyright the Authors.","Aging and well-being; Frailty; Health; Mortality; Survival","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease; Cohort Studies; Fatigue; Female; Frail Elderly; Geriatric Assessment; Hand Strength; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Motor Activity; Reaction Time; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Survival Analysis; Weight Loss; accuracy; aged; article; clinical assessment tool; clinical feature; clinical study; cohort analysis; death; deficit index; frail elderly; high risk population; human; major clinical study; mortality; phenotype; phenotypic frailty index; prediction; prognosis; risk assessment; scoring system; symptomatology; syndrome","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG028259)","","Mitnitski A., Graham J., Mogilner A., Et al., Frailty, fitness and late-life mortality in relation to chronological and biological age, BMC Geriatr, 2, (2002); Goggins W.B., Woo J., Sham A., Et al., Frailty index as a measure of biological age in a Chinese population, J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci, 60, pp. 1046-1051, (2005); Kulminski A., Yashin A., Ukraintseva S., Et al., Accumulation of health disorders as a systemic measure of aging: Findings from the NLTCS data, Mech Ageing Dev, 127, pp. 840-848, (2006); Kulminski A.M., Ukraintseva S.V., Akushevich I.V., Et al., Cumulative index of health deficiencies as a characteristic of long life, J Am Geriatr Soc, 55, pp. 935-940, (2007); Yashin A.I., Arbeev K.G., Kulminski A., Et al., Health decline, aging and mortality: How are they related?, Biogerontol, 8, pp. 291-302, (2007); Yashin A.I., Arbeev K.G., Kulminski A., Et al., Cumulative index of elderly disorders and its dynamic contribution to mortality and longevity, Rejuvenat Res, 10, pp. 75-86, (2007); Ferrucci L., Guralnik J.M., Cavazzini C., Et al., The frailty syndrome: A critical issue in geriatric oncology, Crit Rev Oncol Hematol, 46, pp. 127-137, (2003); Mitnitski A., Song X., Skoog I., Et al., Relative fitness and frailty of elderly men and women in developed countries and their relationship with mortality, J Am Geriatr Soc, 53, pp. 2184-2189, (2005); Puts M.T., Lips P., Deeg D.J., Sex differences in the risk of frailty for mortality independent of disability and chronic diseases, J Am Geriatr Soc, 53, pp. 40-47, (2005); Newman A.B., Gottdiener J.S., McBurnie M.A., Et al., Associations of subclinical cardiovascular disease with frailty, J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci, 56, (2001); Woo J., Goggins W., Sham A., Et al., Public health significance of the frailty index, Disabil Rehabil, 28, pp. 515-521, (2006); Fried L.P., Tangen C.M., Walston J., Et al., Frailty in older adults: Evidence for a phenotype, J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci, 56, (2001); Bortz I.I.W.M., A conceptual framework of frailty: A review, J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci, 57, (2002); Fisher A.L., Just what defines frailty?, J Am Geriatr Soc, 53, pp. 2229-2230, (2005); Lally F., Crome P., Understanding frailty, Postgrad Med J, 83, pp. 16-20, (2007); Bergman H., Ferrucci L., Guralnik J., Et al., Frailty: An emerging research and clinical paradigm - Issues and controversies, J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci, 62, pp. 731-737, (2007); Levers M.J., Estabrooks C.A., Ross Kerr J.C., Factors contributing to frailty: Literature review, J Adv Nurs, 56, pp. 282-291, (2006); Rockwood K., Song X., MacKnight C., Et al., A global clinical measure of fitness and frailty in elderly people, Can Med Assoc J, 173, pp. 489-495, (2005); Rockwood K., Andrew M., Mitnitski A., A comparison of two approaches to measuring frailty in elderly people, J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci, 62, pp. 738-743, (2007); Apmj C., Dekker J.M., Feskens E.J., Et al., How to select a frail elderly population?

Age-period-cohort (APC) analysis aims to analyze age-year-specific archived event rates to capture temporal trends in the events under investigation. However, in the context of tables of rates, the well-known relationship among these three factors, Period - Age = Cohort, makes the parameter estimation of the APC multiple classification model difficult. The identification problem of the parameter estimation has been studied since the 1970s and still remains in debate. Recent developments in this regard include the intrinsic estimator (IE) method, the autoregressive cohort model, the age-period-cohort-characteristic (APCC) model, the regression splines model, the smoothing cohort model, and the hierarchical APC model. O'Brien (2011; pp. 419-452, this issue) makes a further contribution in studying constrained estimators, particularly the IE, in the APC models. The authors, however, have important disagreements with O'Brien as to what the statistical properties of the IE are and how the estimates from the IE should be interpreted. The authors point out these disagreements to conclude the article. © The Author(s) 2011.","age-period-cohort models; constrained estimators; intrinsic estimator; temporal dimensions","","","","","","","","Clayton D., Schifflers E., Models for Temporal Variation in Cancer Rates: II.

The authors compare the fixedversus random-effects model specifications for APC analysis. They use data on verbal test scores from 15 cross sections of the General Social Survey (GSS), 1974 to 2000, for substantive illustrations. Strengths and weaknesses are identified for both the random- and fixed-effects formulations. However, under each of the two data conditions studied, the random-effects hierarchical APC model is the most appropriate specification. While additional analyses and comparisons of random- and fixed-effects APC models using other data sets are necessary before generalizations can be drawn, this finding is consistent with results from other methodological studies with unbalanced data designs. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Age-period-cohort analysis; Fixed effects; General Social Survey; Random effects","","","","","","","","Alwin D.F., 'Family of Origin and Cohort Differences in Verbal Ability, '' American Sociological Review, 56, pp. 625-38, (1991); Alwin D.F., McCammon R.J., 'Aging Versus Cohort Interpretations of Intercohort Differences in GSS Vocabulary Scores, '' American Sociological Review, 64, pp. 272-86, (1999); Baltagi B.H., Econometric Analysis of Panel Data, (1995); Clayton D., Schifflers E., Models for Temporal Variation in Cancer Rates.

Data gathered from the North Carolina Court Counselors' Intensive Protective Supervision Project provides a context for the application of these statistical techniques to assess this program's effectiveness. This experimental project was designed topnovide intensive supervision for status offenders who are placed under the protective supervision of the juvenile courts in North Carolina. It is found that, although intensive supervision had the desired impact of reducing the probability of delinquent offenses during the early (first year and a half) phase of the project, this effect deteriorated over the full three and a half years of the experiment. In addition, the hazards regression analysis shows that youths under intensive supervtsion failed (recidivated with status or delinquent offenses) at a more rapid rate than those under regular supervision. Implications are drawn for the management and effectiveness of intensive supervision programs. © 1994, Sage Publications.

For all ages combined, the DI, pulse pressure, and blood glucose are the strongest determinants of both long-term survival and longevity, contributing cumulatively to their explanation. Diastolic blood pressure and hematocrit are less significant determinants of both of these outcomes. The pulse rate is more relevant to survival, whereas serum cholesterol is more relevant to longevity. Only the DI is a significant predictor of longevity and mortality for each 5-year age group ranging from 45 to 85 years. The DI appears to be a more important determinant of long-term risks of death and longevity than are the physiological indices.

First, is the life course of individual offending patterns marked by distinctive periods of quiescence? Second, at the level of the individual, do offending rates vary systematically with age? In particular, is the age‐crime curve single peaked or flat? Third, are chronic offenders different from less active offenders? Do offenders themselves differ in systematic ways? Using a new approach to the analysis of individual criminal careers—based on nested, mixed Poisson models in which the mixing distribution is estimated nonparametrically—we analyze a panel data set that tracks a sample of males for more than 20 years. Our results provide empirical evidence in support of some features of criminal propensity theory and some in support of conventional criminal careers theory. In support of latent‐trait criminal propensity theory, the individual‐level average offense rate (per unit of time) varies as a function of observable individual‐level characteristics and unobservable heterogeneity among individuals, and the age trajectory of the offense rate is generally single peaked rather than flat. On the other hand, in support of conventional criminal careers theory, models that incorporate a parameter that permits periods of active as well as inactive offending across age have greater explanatory power than those that do not. In addition, the nonparametric, discrete approximation to the population distribution of unobservable heterogeneity in the individual‐level mean offense rate facilitates identification of four classes of offenders—nonoffenders as well as individual‐level characteristics that are unique to each group. Problems of theoretical explanation and empirical generalizability of these results are described. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

By comparison, the ProFamy method uses demographic rates as input and projects more detailed household types, sizes, and living arrangements for all members of the population. Tests of projections from 1990 to 2000 using ProFamy and based on observed U.S. demographic rates before 1991 show that discrepancies between our projections and census observations in 2000 are reasonably small, validating the new method. Using data from national surveys and vital statistics, census microfiles, and the ProFamy method, we prepare projections of U.S. households from 2000 to 2050. Medium projections as well as projections based on smaller and larger family scenarios with corresponding combinations of assumptions of marriage/union formation and dissolution, fertility, mortality, and international migration are performed to analyze future trends of U.S. households and their possible higher and lower bounds, as well as enormous racial differentials. To our knowledge, the household projections reported in this article are the first to have found empirical evidence of family household momentum and to have provided informative low and high bounds of various indices of projected future households and living arrangements distributions based on possible changes in demographic parameters. © Springer 2006.","Headship rates; Household projection; Macrosimulation; ProFamy method","North America; United States; census; demography; fertility; household survey; migration; mortality; population dynamics; simulation","","","","","NIH/NIA SBIR, (1R43 AG022734-01); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; U.S. Census Bureau","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, May 1–3, 2003, Minneapolis.

This paper presents an approach to such an estimation based on an isomorphism between the structure of the stochastic model underlying a conventional specification of the increment-decrement life table and that of Markov panel regression models for simple state spaces. We argue that Markov panel regression procedures can be used to provide smoothed or graduated group-specific estimates of transition probabilities that are more stable across short age intervals than those computed directly from sample data. We then join these estimates with increment-decrement life table methods to compute group-specific total, active, and dependent life expectancy estimates. To illustrate the methods, we describe an empirical application to the estimation of such life expectancies specific to sex, race, and education (years of school completed) for a longitudinal panel of elderly persons. We find that education extends both total life expectancy and active life expectancy. Education thus may serve as a powerful social protective mechanism delaying the onset of health problems at older ages. © 1994 Population Association of America.","","Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Cause of Death; Female; Human; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Markov Chains; Models, Statistical; Mortality; North Carolina; Socioeconomic Factors; Stochastic Processes; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Survival Analysis; USA; health status; increment-decrement life table; life expectancy; life-table method; methodological analysis; regression model; aged; analysis of variance; article; cause of death; classification; daily life activity; female; human; life expectancy; life table; longitudinal study; male; mortality; probability; socioeconomics; statistical model; statistics; survival; United States","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (N01AG012102)","","Branch L.G., Guralnik J.M., Foley D.J., Kohout F.J., Wetle T.T., Ostfeld A., Katz S., “Active Life Expectancy for 10,000 Caucasian Men and Women in Three Communities.”, Journal of Gerontology, 46, pp. 145-50, (1991); Branch L.G., Ku L., “Transition Probabilities to Dependency, Institutionalization and Death among the Elderly over a Decade.”, Journal of Aging and Health, 1, pp. 370-408, (1989); Chiang C.L., The Life Table and Its Applications, (1984); Coale A., Kisker E.E., “Mortality Crossover: Reality or Bad Data?”, Population Studies, 40, pp. 389-401, (1986); Coleman J.S., Introduction to Mathematical Sociology, (1964); Coleman J.S., “The Mathematical Study of Social Change.”, Methodology in Social Research, pp. 428-478, (1968); Coleman J.S., Longitudinal Data Analysis, (1981); Efron B., The Jackknife, the Bootstrap and Other Resampling Plans, (1982); Gill R.D., “Multistate Life-Tables and Regression Models.”, Mathematical Population Studies, 3, pp. 259-76, (1992); Guilkey D.K., Rindfuss R.R., “Logistic Regression Multivariate Life Tables: A Communicable Approach.”, Sociological Methods & Research, 16, pp. 276-300, (1987); Guralnik J.M., Land K.C., Blazer D., Fillenbaum G.G., Branch L.G., “Educational Status and Active Life Expectancy among Older Blacks and Whites.”, New England Journal of Medicine, 329, 8, pp. 110-16, (1993); Hannan M.T., “Multistate Demography and Event History Analysis.”, Stochastic Modeling of Social Processes, pp. 39-88, (1984); Hayward M.D., Grady W.R., “Work and Retirement among a Cohort of Older Men in the United States, 1966–1983.”, Demography, 27, pp. 337-56, (1990); Hoem J.M., “A Markov Chain Model of Working Life Tables.”, Scandinavian Actuarial Journal, 1977, pp. 1-20, (1977); Hoem J.M., Jensen U.F., “Multistate Life Table Methodology: A Probabilist Critique.”, Multidimensional Mathematical Demography, pp. 155-264, (1982); Hsiao C., Analysis of Panel Data, (1986); Katz S., Branch L.G., Branson M.H., Papsidero J.A., Beck J.C., Greer D.S., “Active Life Expectancy.”, New England Journal of Medicine, 309, pp. 1218-24, (1983); Katz S., Ford A.B., Moskowitz R.W., Jackson B.A., Jaffe M.W., “Studies of Illness in the Aged.”, Journal of the American Medical Association, 185, pp. 94-99, (1963); Keyfitz N., Applied Mathematical Demography, (1989); Kitagawa E.M., Hauser P.M., Differential Mortality in the United States: A Study in Socioeconomic Epidemiology, (1973); Korn E.L., Graubard B.I., “Epidemiologic Studies Utilizing Surveys: Accounting for the Sampling Design.”, American Journal of Public Health, 81, pp. 1166-73, (1991); Land K.C., Hough G.C., “Improving the Accuracy of Intercensal Estimates and Postcensal Projections of the Civilian Noninstitutional Population: A Parameterization of Institutional Prevalence Rates.”, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 81, pp. 62-74, (1986); Land K.C., “New Methods for Tables of School Life, with Applications to U.S. Data from Recent School Years.”, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 84, pp. 63-75, (1989); Land K.C., Schoen R., “Statistical Methods for Markov-Generated Increment-Decrement Life Tables with Polynomial Gross Flow Functions.”, Multidimensional Mathematical Demography, pp. 265-346, (1982); Ledent J., “Multistate Life Tables: Movement versus Transition Perspectives.”, Environment and Planning A, 12, pp. 533-62, (1980); London D., Graduation: The Revision of Estimates, (1985); U.S. Decennial Life Tables for 1979–81.

It is well known that the identification problem created by the linear dependency of age, period, and cohort (Period= Age + Cohort or P = A + C) presents a major methodological challenge to APC analysis, a problem that has been widely addressed in demography, epidemiology, and statistics. This paper compares parameter estimates and model fit statistics produced by two solutions to the identification problem in age-period-cohort models - namely, the conventional demographic approach of constrained generalized linear models (Fienberg and Mason 1978, 1985; Mason and Smith 1985) and the intrinsic estimator method recently developed by Fu (2000; Knight and Fu 2000; Fu, Hall, and Rohan 2004). We report empirical analyses of applications of these two methods to population data on U.S. female mortality rates. Comparisons of parameter estimates suggest that both constrained generalized linear models and the intrinsic estimator method can yield similar estimates of age, period, and cohort effects, but estimates obtained by the intrinsic estimator are more direct and do not require prior information to select appropriate model identifying constraints. We also describe three statistical properties of the estimators: (1) finite-time-period bias, (2) relative statistical efficiency, and (3) consistency as the number of periods of observed data increases. These empirical analyses and theoretical results suggest that the intrinsic estimator may well provide a useful alternative to conventional methods for the APC analysis of demographic rates.","","","","","","","","","Agretsi A., An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, (1996); Casella G., Berger R.L., Statistical Inference. 2d Ed., (2002); Clayton D., Schifflers E., Models for temporal variation in cancer rates.

Compared to Western society, the average length of the first birth interval is much longer in traditional Indian society. Yet Indian fertility rates are higher because of either ineffective family planning procedures or deliberate nonuse of birth control and because of the high proportion of the population that is married. Here, we examine the effects of various sociodemographic covariates (with an emphasis on the role of age at marriage) on the length of the first birth interval for two states of India: Assam and Uttar Pradesh. Life table and multivariate hazards modeling techniques are applied to the data. Covariates such as age at marriage, present age of mother, female's occupation, family income, and place of residence have strong effects on the variation of the length of the first birth interval. For each subgroup of females (classified according to different levels of the covariates), the median length of the first birth interval for the Assam (Bengali-speaking) sample is shorter than that of the Uttar Pradesh (Hindi-speaking) sample.; Indian marriage customs vary by religion, caste, geographic location, and educational background. This study examined the effects of age at marriage and socioeconomic factors on the interval to first birth in Assam and Uttar Pradesh (UP) states. Data were obtained on Bengali-speaking scheduled castes (the lowest castes) in Assam and Hindu-speaking scheduled castes in UP from a 1988-89 survey in Assam and a 1987-88 survey in UP. The Assam survey included 1805 scheduled caste households and the UP survey included 3931 households (1143 scheduled castes). Income is grouped as very poor (under 50 rupees), poor, middle, and rich (over 100 rupees). Cox's proportional hazard models expressed the relative risks of time to first birth. Marriage age underwent a change, with the greatest differences occurring among younger, illiterate, working class Manasudra subclass women in the highest income and middle status groups living in Ghazipur district. The life table methods of Namboordiri and Suchindran were used to calculate median lengths of birth intervals and revealed that Assam women have shorter intervals. The shortest intervals were among Assam working mothers, and the longest intervals were among Assam females of other subcastes. In UP, the shortest birth interval was among literate mothers, and the longest interval (49 months) was among younger mothers. Nearly 7% of women did not give birth within 97 months. As marriage age increased, the birth interval shortened. In Assam, the birth interval was significantly related to marriage ages under 13 years, 14 years, and 15-16 years; the present age of the mother, mother's occupation, other subcaste group; and the very poor and middle income group. In UP, the significant factors explaining birth interval were marriage ages of under 13 years and 14 years, present age of the mother, and mothers living in Ghazipur district. The relative risks of first birth for mothers in marriage age groups under 13 years, 14 years, and 15-16 years was 0.58, 0.77, and 0.88 respectively. Mothers in UP had similar risks in the first two age groups.","","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Birth Intervals; Child; Female; Humans; India; Life Tables; Male; Marriage; Proportional Hazards Models; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors; Age Factors; Asia; Birth Intervals; Caste; Culture; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; First Birth Intervals; Human Resources; Income; India; Life Table Method; Marriage; Marriage Age; Marriage Patterns; Nuptiality; Occupations; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Probability; Research Methodology; Research Report; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Southern Asia; Statistical Studies; Studies; adolescent; adult; age; analysis of variance; article; Asia; caste; child; cultural anthropology; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Economic Factors; educational status; family planning; female; fertility; Fertility Measurements; First Birth Intervals; human; Human Resources; income; India; life table; life table method; male; marriage; Marriage Age; Marriage Patterns; methodology; nuptiality; occupation; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; probability; proportional hazards model; Research Report; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Southern Asia; Statistical Studies; statistics; Studies; time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00187143","","","8262506","English","Hum.

Estimates of effects for five other indicators of childhood conditions are similarly positive but mostly not statistically significant. Multivariate survival analysis shows that better childhood socioeconomic conditions in general tend to reduce the four-year period mortality risk among the oldest-old. But after additional controls for 14 covariates are put into the model, the effects are not statistically significant, thus suggesting that most of the effects of childhood conditions on oldest-old mortality are indirect - at least to the point of affecting current health status at the oldest-old ages, which itself is strongly associated with mortality. While acknowledging limitations of the present analyses due to a lack of information on childhood illness, the oldest-olds 'recollection errors, and other data problems, we conclude, based on this and other studies, that policies that enhance childhood health care and children's socioeconomic well-being can have large and long-lasting benefits up to the oldest-old ages.","","","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01AG023627)","","Ahlburg D., Jensen E., Liao Y., When I'm 104: The Determinants of Healthy Longevity Among the Oldest-Old in China, Workshop on Determinants of Healthy Longevity in Chin at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR), (2004);

It follows that we do not accept Greenberg's Eq. (1) as a valid theoretical representation of the processes of interest. We briefly review the substantive context from which our investigation began in the mid-1980s. We also review the time series properties of our model and of the aggregate unemployment and crime rates used in its estimation. We note how the time series behavior of various crime rates determines which parts of the Cantor and Land model are and are not likely to be estimated as statistically significant for those series. We conclude with some comments on the limitations of aggregate time series research designs for testing the behavioral hypotheses used to generate expected relationships between aggregate unemployment and crime rates and suggest some alternative research designs.","Crime rates; Time series analysis; Unemployment rates","","","","","","","","Bryck A.S., Raudenbush S.W., Hierarchical Linear Models: Applications and Data Analysis Methods, (1992); Cantor D., Land K.C., Unemployment and crime rates in the post-World War II United States: A theoretical and empirical analysis, Am.

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of pooled data from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) assessing health and functioning of the U.S. elderly in 1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999. Results: Distributions of frequency, residual life span, mortality rate, and relative risk of death are remarkably similar over age and FI. Coefficients of correlation between FI and age are low both for males (0.127, p < .01) and females (0.221, p < .01). The FI-specific age patterns show deceleration at advanced ages. The FI can provide order of magnitude better resolution in estimating mean remaining life span compared to age. Males have smaller FI than females while males' mortality risks are higher. For short-time horizons, the FI and age are largely independently associated with mortality risks. Conclusions: The FI: (i) can be considered as an adequate sex-specific indicator of the aging-associated processes in the elderly, (ii) can characterize these processes independently of age, and (iii) is a better characteristic of the aging phenotype than chronological age. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We develop 14 criteria for determining the validity and usefulness of such QOL indexes to public policy. We then review 22 of the most-used QOL indexes from around the world. We conclude that many of the indexes are successful in that they are reliable, have established time series measures, and can be disaggregated to study subpopulations. However, many fall short in four areas: (1) indexes vary greatly in their coverage and definitions of domains of QOL, (2) none of the indexes distinguish among the concepts of input, throughput, and output that are used by public policy analysts, (3) they fail to show how QOL outputs are sensitive to public policy inputs, and (4) none have examined convergent validity against each other. We conclude that many of these indexes are potentially very useful for public policy and recommend research to further improve them.","","national planning; quality of life; socioeconomic indicator","","","","","","","Allardt E., The relationship between objective and subjective measures in the light of a comparative study, Comparative Studies in Sociology, (1978);

This investigation helps resolve the debate by distinguishing among different religious traditions. It is hypothesized that differences in participation can be traced to racial, ethnic, and doctrinal divisions, and moreover, that these divisions also provide the contingent conditions under which competition or monopoly effects operate. Using pooled cross-sectional time series, comparisons center on Catholics, Baptists, and Mainline denominations. Separate analyses are presented for white and black Baptists, and for the Northern Baptist Convention that emerged in the early 20th century as a relatively liberal Baptist denomination. The results suggest that ecumenical and liberal religious traditions did accompany religious diversity, but membership in such churches grew very slowly. In contrast, groups that faced discrimination as well as those that shielded themselves from progressive currents of modernism sustained high rates of growth. Their monopoly situations are evident in the low religious diversity of counties in which they grew (as well as by low ethnic or racial diversity) and by their increasing spatial concentration over time. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","black church; ethnicity; nativism; race; religion","","","","","","","","Allison, Change scores as dependent variables in regression analysis, Sociological Methodology, 20, pp. 93-114, (1990); Argersinger, Jeffries, American electoral history, Research in Micropolitics, Vol. 1:1–33, (1986); Artrong O.K., Artrong, The Baptists in America, (1979); Askew, Spellman, The Churches and the American Experience, (1984); Bainbridge, Stark, Sucide, homicide and religion, Annual Review of the Social Sciences of Religion, 5, pp. 33-56, (1981); Beger, The Sacred Canopy, (1967); Blau, Land, Redding, The expansion of religious affiliation, Social Science Research, 21, pp. 329-352, (1992); Breault, New evidence on religious pluralism, urbanism and religious participation, American Sociological Review, 54, pp. 1056-1059, (1989); Breault, Reply to Finke and Stark, American Sociological Review, 54, pp. 1056-1059, (1989); Chalfant, Beckley, Palmer, Religion in Contemporary Society, (1987); Chidester, Patterns of Power: Religion and Politics in American Culture, (1988); Christiano, Numbering Israel: The U.S. census and religious organizations, Social Science History, 8, pp. 341-370, (1984); Christiano, Religious Diversity and Social Change, (1987); Cox, Religion in the Secular City, (1984); Dahrendorf, Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society, (1959); Davis, Immigrants, Baptists and the Protestant Mind in American, (1973); de Vaus, McAllister, Gender differences in religion, American Sociological Review, 52, pp. 472-481, (1987); Dolan, The American Catholic Experience, (1985); Finke, Demographics of religious participation, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 28, pp. 45-58, (1989); Finke, Stark, Turning pews into people, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 25, pp. 180-192, (1986); Finke, Stark, Religious economies and sacred canopies, American Sociological Review, 53, pp. 41-49, (1988); Finke, Stark, Comment on Breault, American Sociological Review, 54, pp. 1054-1055, (1989); Finke, Stark, How the upstart sects won America: 1776–1850, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 28, pp. 27-44, (1989); Finke, Stark, The Churching of America, 1776–1990, (1992); Fitts, A History of Black Baptists, (1985); Gibbs, Martin, Urbanization, technology, and the division of labor, American Sociological Review, 27, pp. 667-677, (1962); Greeley, Ethnicity in the United States, (1974); Greeley, Ethnicity, Denomination and Inequality, (1976); Greeley, The American Catholic, (1977); Greeley, The demography of American Catholics: 1965–1990, Vatican II and U.S. Catholicism, Vol. 2.

That is, can CWI well-being concepts, indicators, domains of well-being, and composite indices be applied and interpreted at subnational levels? Chapter. 7 addressed this question at the level of the 50 individual US states. This chapter zooms in on regional areas within states, such as counties and groups of counties. Lee et al. (2009) studied this question at the level of six counties (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara) that comprise the San Francisco Bay Area and for each of the individual counties and made comparisons of the resulting child and youth well-being indices with the corresponding CWI for the state of California. Fu et al. (2009) updated this analysis and extended it to include the county of Los Angeles, California. To illustrate the data limitations and challenges encountered at the substate regional level of analysis of child and youth well-being as well as the potentials of such analyses, this chapter describes and reports a number of findings from those articles/reports, especially from Fu et al.

The 12-person panel prepared estimates from five national data sets and investigated methodological sources of the inconsistencies among the population aged 70 and older from the early 1980s to 2001. Although the evidence was mixed for the 1980s and it is difficult to pinpoint when in the 1990s the decline began, during the mid- and late 1990s, the panel found consistent declines on the order of 1%-2.5% per year for two commonly used measures in the disability literature: difficulty with daily activities and help with daily activities. Mixed evidence was found for a third measure: the use of help or equipment with daily activities. The panel also found agreement across surveys that the proportion of older persons who receive help with bathing has declined at the same time as the proportion who use only equipment (but not personal care) to bathe has increased. In comparing findings across surveys, the panel found that the period, definition of disability, treatment of the institutionalized population, and age standardizing of results were important to consider. The implications of the findings for policy, national survey efforts, and further research are discussed.","","","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (U01AG009740)","","Agree E.M., Freedman V.A., Incorporating assistive devices into long term care arrangements: Analysis of the second supplement on aging, Journal of Aging and Health, 12, pp. 426-450, (2000); Albrecht G.L., Seelman K.D., Bury M., Handbook of Disability Studies, (2001); Arias E., Smith B.L., Deaths: Preliminary Data for 2001.

The proportion of 2004 North Carolina workplaces in high-risk industries was computed following spatial linkage of individual workplaces to 2000 United States Census Block Groups (n = 3,925). Thirty census-derived socioeconomic variables (selected a priori as potentially predictive of violence) were summarized using exploratory factor analysis into poverty/deprivation, human/economic capital, and transience/instability. Multinomial logistic regression models indicate associations between higher proportion of workplaces belonging to high-risk industries and Block Groups with more poverty/deprivation or transience/instability and less human/economic capital. The relationship between human/economic capital and Block Groups proportion of high-risk industry workplaces was modified by levels of transience/instability. Community characteristics therefore contribute to the potential for workplace violence, and future research should continue to understand the relationship between social context and workplace violence risk. © Society for Community Research and Action 2009.","Community factors; High risk industry; Social context; Workplace violence","Censuses; Homicide; Humans; Industry; North Carolina; Risk Factors; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors; Violence; Workplace; article; homicide; human; industry; population research; risk factor; social environment; socioeconomics; statistics; United States; violence; workplace","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD050924); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, UNC-CH; Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, ARI; National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Japan, JNIOSH, (5-R01-OH003897); National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Japan, JNIOSH","Acknowledgments This work was supported by Occupational Epidemiology Training Grants: 1-T42-OH008673 and T42-CCT422952 from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Two approaches dominate this controversy. One originates in the criminal careers paradigm, which emphasizes a potential heterogeneity of offending groups in the general population - thus leading to a distinction between incidence and prevalence of criminal offending, a focus on the onset, persistence, and desistence of criminal careers, and the possibility that criminals are a distinctive group with constant high rates of offending. Another approach places criminal events within a broader context of studies of the life course by explicitly substituting the conceptualization of ""social events"" for that of ""criminal careers."" With respect to analytical models, this approach emphasizes a potential heterogeneity of offenders with respect to order of criminal events from first to second to higher orders and thus suggests an analysis of the ""risks"" or ""hazards"" of offending by order of offense. Some extant commentaries on the criminal careers and life course approaches to conceptualizing and modeling longitudinal sequences of delinquent and criminal events committed by individuals have emphasized their differences and incompatibilities. In contrast, we apply recently developed semiparametric mixed Poisson regression techniques to develop conditions under which the two conceptual/modeling approaches are formally equivalent. We also modify the semiparametric mixed Poisson regression model of criminal careers to incorporate information on order of the delinquent/criminal event and develop an empirical application. This modification demonstrates the complementarity of the criminal careers and life course approaches, even though they have somewhat different foci.","Criminal careers; Hazards models; Poisson models; Studies of the life course","","","","","","","","Allison P.D., Discrete-time methods for the analysis of event histories, Sociol.

It next describes the current state of knowledge with respect to the founding goals of this field. The focus then turns to the topic of measuring changes in child and youth well-being in the United States over the past few decades. In particular, the evidence-based approach used in the construction of the recently developed composite Child and Youth Well-Being Index (CWI) is described. Some findings from the CWI regarding changes in child and youth well-being in the period 1975-2004 are reported. Trends in the CWI then are compared with data on trends in subjective well-being of high school seniors - similarities of trends in these two series provide validating support for the interpretation of the CWI as an index of changes in the quality-of-life of children and youth. Using data on some additional indicator series, most of which were initiated in the 1990s, an Expanded CWI is then described. The qualitative pattern of change in the expanded CWI is shown to be similar to that of the basic CWI, except that the expanded CWI shows a more pronounced decline in the early-1990s and a slower rate of improvement into the early-2000s.

It is found that the performance of the predictive mean method varies considerably with the predictive power of the imputation regression model and the percentage of cases with missing data on income. In comparisons of single-value with multiple-imputation methods, it also is found that the amount of bias and the loss of precision associated with single-value methods is considerably less than that associated with a weak imputation model. Situations in which using imputed data can lead to seriously biased estimates of regression coefficients (and related statistics) and situations in which the bias is so minimal as to be nonproblematic are identified.","","","","","","","","","Berk R.A., An introduction to sample selection bias in sociological data, American Sociological Review, 48, pp. 386-398, (1983); Cohen J., Cohen P., Applied Multiple Regression/correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1975); Cornoni-Huntley J., Blazer D.G., Brock D.B., Farmer M.E., Established Populations for Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly: Volume II.3.

Nevin (2000) proffers a cohort-based explanation that these trends can be attributed to corresponding trends in gasoline lead exposure during the youths' early years. He contends that the increased consumption of leaded gasoline in the 1960s and 1970s exposed children born during that period to toxins that adversely impacted their intelligence levels (IQs). This decreased their intellectual ability, resulted in poor decisions made during their teen and young adult years, and in turn, led to a disproportionally high level of criminal involvement and unwed pregnancies among this cohort. The present study evaluates Nevin's causal model by testing the connection between trends in lead exposure and youthful problem behavior with age-period-cohort-characteristic (APCC) models.

Four latent classes of offending careers is an appropriate number for the London cohort, but five classes can be justified for the Philadelphia data. In the case of the Racine cohorts, five classes may be detected for the 1942 and 1955 cohorts but only four for the 1949 cohort. Despite the varying numbers of latent offending classes, there clearly is a small number of typical age patterns.","","","","","","","","","Abbott A., Hrycak A., Measuring resemblance in sequence data, American Journal of Sociology, 96, pp. 144-185, (1990); Systems A., GAUSS 3.0 Systems and Applications Manual, (1992); Avi-Itzhak B., Shinnar R., Quantitative models in crime control, Journal of Criminal Justice, 1, pp. 185-217, (1973); Birkelund G.E., Goodman L.A., Rose D., The latent structure of job characteristics of men and women, American Journal of Sociology, 102, pp. 80-113, (1996); Blumstein A., Cohen J., Roth J.A., Visher C.A., Criminal Careers and ""Career Criminals,"", (1986); Cameron A.C., Trivedi P.K., Econometric models based on count data: Comparisons and applications of some estimators and tests, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 1, pp. 29-53, (1986); Caspi A., Daryl J B., Personality continuity and change across the life course, Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research, (1990); Caspi A., Moffitt T.E., When do individual differences matter?

They assume that many social indicators are available to describe the social unit, but individuals disagree about the relative weights to be assigned to each social indicator. The summary index that maximizes agreement among citizens can then be derived, along with conditions under which an index will be endorsed by a majority in the social unit. The authors show that intuition greatly underestimates the extent of agreement among individuals, and it is often possible to construct a QOL index that most citizens agree with (at least in direction). In particular, they show that the equal-weighting strategy is privileged in that it minimizes disagreement among all possible individuals' weights. They demonstrate these propositions by calculating real QOL indices for two surveys of citizens' actual importance weights. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Heterogeneous importance weights; Quality-of-life indices; Summary index construction; Well-being accounts","","","","","","","","Andrews Frank M., Withey.

This study provides support for such characterization from a longitudinal analysis of the frailty index properties. The data are from the National Long Term Care Survey assessed longitudinally health and functioning of the U.S. elderly in the period 1982-1999. In cross-sectional analysis, the frailty index exhibits accelerated increase with age till oldest-old ages (95+), with possible deceleration thereafter. Longitudinal analysis confirms the accelerated accumulation of deficits in aging individuals. The time-dynamics of the frailty index is affected by two sex-sensitive processes: (i) selection of robust individuals, resulting in a decline of the mean frailty index with age and (ii) accumulation of deficits associated with physiological aging and its interaction with environment, which results in an accelerated increase of individual frailty index prior to death irrespective of chronological age. Current frailty index levels in individuals are more predictive of death than the index past values. Longitudinal analysis provides strong evidence that the cumulative index of health/well-being deficits can characterize aging-associated processes in humans and predict death better than chronological age during short-term periods. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Using a multi‐stage sample of 5,090 Seattle residents, we estimate models for individuals' risks of violent crime and burglary victimization as a function of both individual crime opportunity factors (routine activity and personal lifestyle) and contextual indicators of neighborhood social disorganization (neighborhood incivilities on conditions of disorder, ethnic heterogeneity, and neighborhood density in terms of both residents and strangers). Strong contextual direct effects of density, disorder, and heterogeneity are observed for violent and or burglary risks. Further, the hierarchical method used here provides a richer type of contextual analysis, indicating that neighborhood factors also “condition” the impact of crime opportunity factors for risk of both violent and burglary victimization. Implications for theoretical integration, victimization prevention strategies, and crime control policies are discussed. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Land, Patricia L. McCall, and Lawrence Cohen, ""Structural Covariates of Homicide Rates: Are There Any Invariances Across Time and Social Space?"" approaches, the question that these scholars originally posed is raised again: Have researchers been able to identify a set of robust structural covariates that consistently predict crime rates? Subsequent to the publication of this piece, numerous scholars have replicated and extended its conceptual, methodological, and empirical work in various ways-with more than 500 citations to date. In response to this attention, the authors first review the advances made by the Land et al.article. This is followed by a review of findings from studies published over the past 20 years to determine which structural predictors identified in the Land et al.piece continue to be prominent in the study of homicide and which structural predictors have surfaced in recent years as influential to crime rates. Using data on U.S. cities for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000, the authors then present a systematic empirical assessment of the explanatory power of the covariates of homicide rates identified in the Land et al.study. Twenty years later, we find support for the claims of invariance established in Land et al.and acknowledge the contributions of this piece to the macrolevel study of homicide rates. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","Crime fluctuations; Homicide rates; Macrolevel analysis; Structural predictors","","","","","","","","Akins S., Racial segregation and property crime: Examining the mediating effect of police strength, Justice Quarterly, 20, pp. 675-695, (2003); Bailey W.C., Poverty, inequality and city homicide rates: Some not so expected findings, Criminology, 22, pp. 531-550, (1984); Beaulieu M., Messner S.F., Assessing changes in the effect of divorce rates on homicide rates across large U.S. cities, 1960-2000: Revisiting the Chicago School, Homicide Studies, 14, pp. 24-51, (2010); Bellair P., Roscigno V.J., Local labor market opportunity and adolescent delinquency, Social Forces, 78, pp. 1509-1538, (2000); Bellair P., Roscigno V.J., McNulty T.L., Linking local labor market opportunity to violent adolescent delinquency, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 40, pp. 6-34, (2003); Blau J., Blau P., Metropolitan structure and violent crime, American Sociological Review, 47, pp. 114-128, (1982); Bursik R.J., Social disorganization and theories of crime and delinquency: Problems and prospects, Criminology, 26, pp. 519-551, (1988); Bursik Jr. R.J., Grasmick H., Neighborhoods and Crime: The Dimensions of Effective Community Control, (1993); Cloward R.A., Ohlen L.E., Delinquency and Opportunity: A Theory of Delinquent Gangs, (1960); Cohen A.K., Delinquent Boys: The Culture of the Gang, (1955); Cohen L.E., Felson M., Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activity approach, American Sociological Review, 44, pp. 588-608, (1979); Cohen L.E., Felson M., Land K.C., Property crime rates in the United States: A macrodynamic analysis, 1947-77, with ex ante forecasts for the mid-1980's, American Journal of Sociology, 85, pp. 90-118, (1980); Cohen L.E., Kluegel J.R., Land K.C., Social inequality and predatory criminal victimization: An exposition and test of a formal theory, American Sociological Review, 46, pp. 505-524, (1981); Corzine J., Huff-Corzine L., On cultural explanations of southern homicide: Comment on Dixon and Lizotte, American Journal of Sociology, 95, pp. 178-182, (1989); Crutchfield R., Labor stratification and violent crime, Social Forces, 68, pp. 489-512, (1989); Crutchfield R., Pitchford S.R., Work and crime: The effects of labor stratification, Social Forces, 76, pp. 93-118, (1997); Fabio A., Loeber R., Balasubramani G.K., Roth J., Fu W., Farrington D.P., Why some generations are more violent than others: Assessment of age, period, and cohort effects, American Journal of Epidemiology, 164, pp. 151-160, (2006); Gordon R.A., Issues in multiple regression, American Journal of Sociology, 73, pp. 592-516, (1968); Hirschi T., The Causes of Delinquency, (1969); Kim J., Mueller C.W., Factor Analysis: Statistical Methods and Practical Issues, (1978); Krivo L.J., Peterson R.D., Extremely disadvantaged neighborhoods and urban crime, Social Forces, 75, pp. 619-648, (1996); Krivo L.J., Peterson R.D., The structural context of homicide: Accounting for racial differences in process, American Sociological Review, 65, pp. 547-559, (2000); Krivo L.J., Peterson R.D., Labor market conditions and violent crime among youth and adults, Sociological Perspectives, 47, pp. 485-505, (2004); Kubrin C.E., Structural covariates of homicide rates: Does type of homicide matter?, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 40, pp. 139-170, (2003); Kubrin C.E., Weitzer R., Retaliatory homicide: Concentrated disadvantage and neighborhood culture, Social Problems, 50, pp. 157-180, (2003); Land K.C., McCall P.L., Cohen L.E., Structural covariates of homicide rates: Are there any invariances across time and social space?, American Journal of Sociology, 95, pp. 922-963, (1990); Lee M.R., Concentrated poverty, race, and homicide, Sociological Quarterly, 41, pp. 189-206, (2000); Lee M.R., Ousey G.C., Institutional access, residential segregation, and urban Black homicide, Sociological Inquiry, 75, pp. 31-54, (2005); Lee M.R., Ousey G.C., Counterbalancing disadvantage?

However, quantitative research on achievement trajectories has neglected this important variable. Given that retention policies are being institutionalized in schools, it is important to understand the relationship between retention and achievement trajectories. We examine the National Education Longitudinal Study, 1988-1992 to determine if reading and mathematical achievement trajectories for black, white, poor, and nonpoor high school students vary by their experiences with retention. Utilizing growth modeling, we illustrate that an awareness of students' past promotion patterns through school (i.e., experiences with retention) helps us better predict achievement trajectories. Moreover, by analyzing the cojoined effects of race and class, we reveal disparate costs of retention. In fact, we find that poor, white retained students are particularly disadvantaged by experiences with retention. We interpret this finding in light of recent cultural explanations of race and class educational disparities and the historical and institutional stratification processes from which they derive. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we provide further support toward this view focusing on the analysis of the FI age patterns in the participants of the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS). Methods: The NLTCS assessed health and functioning of the U.S. elderly in 1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999. Detailed information for our sample was assessed from about 26,700 interviews. The individual FI is defined as a proportion of health deficits for a given person. Results: The FI in the NLTCS exhibits accelerated age patterns. The acceleration is larger for elderly who, at younger ages, had a lower FI (low FI group) than for those who showed a higher FI at younger ages (high FI group). Age-patterns for low and high FI groups tend to converge at advanced ages. The rate of deficit accumulation is sex-sensitive. Conclusions: The accelerated FI age patterns suggest that FI can be considered as a systemic measure of aging process. Convergence of the (sex-specific) FI age patterns for low and high FI groups by extreme ages might reflect the limit of the FI-specific (or systemic) age as well as the limit of adaptation capacity in aging individuals. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Standard approaches address this issue by means of generalized estimating equations or generalized linear mixed models with logistic links. Using an empirical example and simulated data, we show (1) that cross-level product terms from these models can produce misleading results with respect to whether the within-person rate of change varies across levels of a dichotomous between-person factor; and (2) that subgroup differences in the rate of change should be assessed on an additive scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the probability of disease) rather than on a multiplicative scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the odds of disease). Because usual approaches do not provide a significance test for whether the rate of additive change varies across levels of a between-person factor, sample differences in the rate of additive change may be due to sampling error. We illustrate how standard software can be used to estimate and test whether additive changes vary across levels of a between-person factor. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Generalized estimating equations; Generalized linear mixed models; Interaction; Logistic regression; Repeated measures","","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA; Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging, Claude D Pepper Older Americans Independence Center; Grant No. P30 AG028716.

More specifically, with respect to children, how are our kids (including adolescents and youths) doing? These questions can be addressed by comparisons: (1) to past historical values, (2) to other contemporaneous units (e. g., comparisons among subpopulations, states, regions, countries), or (3) to goals or other externally established standards. The Child and Youth Well-Being Index (CWI), which we have developed over the past decade, uses all three of these points of comparison. The CWI is a composite index based on 28 social indicator time series of various aspects of the well-being of children and youth in American society that date back to 1975, which is used as a base year for measuring changes (improvements or deterioration) in subsequent years. The CWI is evidence-based not only in the sense that it uses time series of empirical data for its construction, but also because the 28 indicators are grouped into seven domains of well-being or areas of social life that have been found to define the conceptual space of the quality of life in numerous studies of subjective well-being. Findings from research using the CWI reported in the paper include: (1) trends in child and youth well-being in the United States over time, (2) international comparisons, and (3) best-practice analyses. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Child well-being index; Quality of life; Social indicators","United States; child development; child welfare; international comparison; quality of life; social indicator","","","","","Foundation for Child Development, FCD","Acknowledgments The Child and Youth Well-Being Index Project is supported by grants from the Foundation for Child Development.","Andrews F.M., Withey S.B., Social Indicators of Well-Being: Americans' Perceptions of Life Quality, (1976); Social Indicators, (1966); Ben-Arieh A., Beyond welfare: Measuring and monitoring the state of children-New trends and domains, Social Indicators Research, 52, pp. 235-257, (2000); Indicators of Children's Well-Being, (2009); Brown B.V., Indicators of children's well-being: A review of current indicators based on data from the federal statistical system, Indicators of Children's Well-Being, (1997); Key Indicators of Child and Youth Well-Being: Completing the Picture, (2008); Campbell A., Converse P.E., Rodgers W.L., The Quality of American Life: Perceptions, Evaluations, and Satisfactions, (1976); Cummins R.A., The domains of life satisfaction: An attempt to order chaos, Social Indicators Research, 38, pp. 303-328, (1996); Cummins R.A., Assessing quality of life, Quality of Life for Handicapped People, (1997); Cummins R.A., Gullone E., Lau A.L.D., A Model of subjective well-being homeostasis: The role of personality, The Universality of Subjective Wellbeing Indicators, pp. 7-46, (2002); Epsing-Andersen G., The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, (1990); Hagerty M.R., Land K.C., Constructing summary indices of quality of life: A model for the effect of heterogeneous importance weights, Sociological Methods and Research, 35, pp. 455-496, (2007); Hernandez D.J., Macartney S.E., Child well-being 1985-2004: Black-White and Hispanic-White gaps narrowing, but persist, (2008); Huebner E.S., Correlates of life satisfaction in children, School Psychology Quarterly, 6, pp. 103-111, (1991); Huebner E.S., Life satisfaction and happiness, Children's Needs II: Development, Problems, and Alternatives, pp. 271-278, (1997); Huebner E.S., Research on assessment of life satisfaction of children and adolescents, Social Indicators Research, 66, pp. 3-33, (2004); Janicek M., Foundations of Evidence-Based Medicine, (2003); Johnston L.D., Bachman J.G., O'Malley P.M., Schulenberg J.E., Monitoring the future: A continuing study of American youth (12th-grade survey), 2003 [computer file], (2003); Land K.C., Social indicators, Annual Review of Sociology, 9, pp. 1-26, (1983); Land K.C., Social indicators, Encyclopedia of Sociology, pp. 2682-2690, (2000); Land K.C., An evidence-based approach to the construction of summary quality-of-life indices, Challenges for Quality of Life in the Contemporary World, pp. 107-124, (2004); Land K.C., Lamb V.L., Meadows S.O., Taylor A., Measuring trends in child well-being: an evidence-based approach, Social Indicators Research, 80, pp. 105-132, (2007); Land K.C., Lamb V.L., Mustillo S.K., Child and youth well-being in the United States, 1975-1998: Some findings from a new index, Social Indicators Research, 56, pp. 241-320, (2001); Meadows S.O., Land K.C., Lamb V.L., Assessing Gilligan versus Sommers: Gender-specific trends in child and youth well-being in the United States, 1985-2001, Social Indicators Research, 70, pp. 1-52, (2005); Moore K.A., Indicators of Child and Family Well-Being: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, (1999); Noll H., Zapf W., Social indicators research: Societal monitoring and social reporting, Trends and Perspectives in Empirical Social Research, (1994); O'Hare W.P., Lamb V.L., Ranking states based on improvement in child well-being during the 1990 s, (2004); O'Hare W.P., Lamb V.L., Ranking states based on improvement in child well-being since 2000, (2009); Veenhoven R., Apparent quality-of-life in nations: how long and happy people live, Social Indicators Research, 71, pp. 61-86, (2005)","K.

It is found that the quadratic age-wealth relationship predicted by Modigliani's Life Cycle Hypothesis is evident in aggregate age-median wealth profiles as well as in the micro data for households with positive net worth. However, when adult status attainment variables are entered into the regression models either by themselves or in combination with marital/family status variables, the age of household head at which net worth begins to decline is far beyond the typical retirement age. In addition, the traditional criterion variables of sociological status attainment theory - educational attainment, occupational status, and earnings - are found to be positively associated with household net worth, although the net effect of occupational status generally is not statistically significant and the earnings effect is nonlinear. Further, consistent with status attainment theory, householder minority status (black, Hispanic) is negatively associated with the accumulation of net worth. It is found that both single male and single female householder status are negatively associated with the accumulation of household net worth (relative to married couple households) as is the size of the household (measured by the number of children under age 18 present). Separate logistic regression analyses show that households with zero and negative net worth are more likely than households with positive net worth to be black and have low earnings. Higher levels of educational and occupational status attainment reduce the probability of zero net worth but not the probability of negative net worth. Male-and female-headed households and households headed by Hispanics also are more likely to have zero net worth, but not negative net worth. The estimated sociodemographic covariate structures of household net worth are found to exhibit substantial stability across both waves and panels in the SIPP - although effects of the 1990-1991 recession are detectable in estimates for the 1990 panel.

We examined the relationships of selected social, clinical, and demographic correlates with four dimensions of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale in 3,401 community-dwelling elders in the Piedmont area of North Carolina. These correlates explained significant variation in somatic complaints and depressed affect; effects of chronic disability and recent negative events were particularly robust. Having a confidant explained reduced symptomatology for all four dimensions, but particularly for low positive affect and interpersonal problems. Positive affect was also buttressed by helping others. These patterns have particular relevance where treatment for depression is divorced from considerations of the social environment of the elderly patient.","","affect; aged; aging; article; chronic disease;

We focus on multimarker analyses and analyses of the effects of compound genotypes of two polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene, rs1042713 and rs1042714, and 11 polymorphisms of the ACE gene, on the risk of such an aging-associated phenotype as myocardial infarction (MI). We used the data from a genotyped sample of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring (FHSO) cohort (n=1500) followed for about 36 years with six examinations. The ADRB2 rs1042714 (C?G) polymorphism and two moderately correlated (r2=0.77) ACE polymorphisms, rs4363 (A?G) and rs12449782 (A?G), were significantly associated with risks of MI in this aging cohort in multimarker models. Predominantly linked ACE genotypes exhibited opposite effects on MI risks, e.g., the AA (rs12449782) genotype had a detrimental effect, whereas the predominantly linked AA (rs4363) genotype exhibited a protective effect. This trade-off occurs as a result of the opposite effects of rare compound genotypes of the ACE polymorphisms with a single dose of the AG heterozygote. This genetic trade-off is further augmented by the selective modulating effect of the rs1042714 ADRB2 polymorphism. The associations were not altered by adjustment for common MI risk factors. The results suggest that effects of single specific genetic variants of the ADRB2 and ACE genes on MI can be readily altered by gene-gene or=and gene-environmental interactions, especially in large heterogeneous samples. Multimarker genetic analyses should benefit studies of complex aging-associated phenotypes. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies;

Nevertheless, most sample surveys use indicators that only tap a general, cognitive assessment of safety - assumed to represent fear of violence. This article examines whether there are conceptually and empirically distinct dimensions of fear of crime by comparing the micro- and macrolevel antecedents of such a general, cognitive ""fear"" - which we call ""perceived risk"" - with those for a more emotionally based, burglary-specific fear. Hierarchical logistic regression models for both types of fear are presented. Some similarities were found between fear and risk in terms of various predictors, but results generally provide further empirical evidence that the two constructs are quite distinct. At the individual-level, the effect of gender is different across models, and routine-activities variables are somewhat better predictors of burglary-specific fear in comparison to risk perception. At the contextual level, neighborhood integration serves to diminish respondents' perceptions of neighborhood danger, yet this variable is positively related to burglary-specific fear.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (SBR-9310193)","*We would like to thank Terance D.

Three predictions from the SM theory are tested by examining the age dependence of mortality patterns for 42 countries (including developed and developing countries) over the period 1955-2003. By applying finite mixture regression models, principal component analysis, and random-effects panel regression models, we find that (1) the negative correlation between the initial adulthood mortality rate and the rate of increase in mortality with age derived in the SM theory exists but is not constant; (2) within the SM framework, the implied age of expected zero vitality (expected maximum survival age) also is variable over time; (3) longevity trajectories are not homogeneous among the countries; (4) Central American and Southeast Asian countries have higher expected age of zero vitality than other countries in spite of relatively disadvantageous national ecological systems; (5) within the group of Central American and Southeast Asian countries, a more disadvantageous national ecological system is associated with a higher expected age of zero vitality; and (6) larger agricultural and food productivities, higher labor participation rates, higher percentages of population living in urban areas, and larger GDP per capita and GDP per unit of energy use are important beneficial national ecological system factors that can promote survival. These findings indicate that the SM theory needs to be generalized to incorporate heterogeneity among human populations. © Population Association of America 2011.","Age of expected zero vitality; Ecological system; Population heterogeneity; Strehler-mildvan theory","","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD050924); Duke University","This article is a revision of a paper presented at the 2008 annual meeting of the Population Association of America, New Orleans, Louisiana.

Data come from a longitudinal study of a representative sample of Bulgarian SOEs for the period from 1989 (the last year under communism) to 1993 (three years after major macroeconomic shifts). We investigate how changes in authority structure, work organization, technology, marketing strategy, and organizational boundaries during these years affected organizational performance in 1993. We also assess the degree of path dependence in performance and the role of competitive industry conditions. Numerous organizational changes made by SOEs during early transition had little effect on performance. Yet organizational performance from 1989 to 1993 was highly path-dependent, although this dependence was mediated by the competitive conditions: Stronger markets displayed less path dependence. Overall the results favor the interpretations derived from selected neo-institutional and ecological perspectives of organizational sociology over neoclassical economic interpretations.","","Bulgaria; industrial performance; market transition; state owned enterprise","","","","","","","Brian A.W., Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy, (1994); Banker R.D., Maximum Likelihood.

In this paper, we investigate the association between breastfeeding and the resumption of menses and the impact of various biological and social covariates thereon, using data from two retrospective surveys in India. We use both univariate life table and multivariate time-dependent hazards techniques to analyze the data. Most prior investigations related the impact of breastfeeding to postpartum amenorrhea by taking duration of breastfeeding as a fixed covariate. However, breastfeeding beyond the resumption of menstruation cannot affect the duration of menses. Accordingly, the present study has a methodological focus in the sense that breastfeeding is treated as a time-dependent covariate. We found that breastfeeding, age of mother at child's birth, social status, level of income, religion and caste (subcaste), and residential status have significant effects on return of menses in Indian traditional society.","","Adult; Amenorrhea; Breast Feeding; Female; Fertility; Humans; India; Menstrual Cycle; Postpartum Period; Proportional Hazards Models; Religion and Medicine; Retrospective Studies; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Asia; Breast Feeding; Culture; Data Analysis; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Fertility; Health; India; Infant Nutrition; Life Table Method; Multivariate Analysis; Nutrition; Population; Population Dynamics; Postpartum Amenorrhea--determinants; Puerperium; Reproduction; Research Methodology; Research Report; Sampling Studies; Southern Asia; Statistical Studies; Studies; Surveys; adult; amenorrhea; article; Asia; breast feeding; cultural anthropology; data analysis; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; epidemiology; female; fertility; health; human; India; infant nutrition; life table method; menstrual cycle; methodology; multivariate analysis; nutrition; physiology; population; population dynamics; Postpartum Amenorrhea--determinants; proportional hazards model; puerperium; religion; reproduction; Research Report; retrospective study; social class; socioeconomics; Southern Asia; Statistical Studies; Studies; Surveys","","","","","Rockefeller Foundation; Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CPC","The research was supported by awards from the Rockefeller Foundation to Dilip C.

We convincingly demonstrate that the lack of genetic effects on an aging-related trait can be because of trade-offs in the gene action. We focus on the well-studied apolipoprotein E (APOE) e2/3/4 polymorphism and on lifespan and ages at onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer, using data on 3924 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. Kaplan-Meier estimates show that the e4 allele carriers live shorter lives than the non-e4 allele carriers (log rank=0.016). The adverse effect was attributed to the poor survival of the e4 homozygotes, whereas the effect of the common e3/4 genotype was insignificant. The e3/4 genotype, however, was antagonistically associated with onsets of those diseases predisposing to an earlier onset of CVD and a later onset of cancer compared to the non-e4 allele genotypes. This trade-off explains the lack of a significant effect of the e3/4 genotype on survival; adjustment for it in the Cox regression model makes the detrimental effect of the e4 allele highly significant (P=0.002). This trade-off is likely caused by the lipid-metabolism-related (for CVD) and nonrelated (for cancer) mechanisms. An evolutionary rationale suggests that genetic trade-offs should not be an exception in studies of aging-related traits. Deeper insights into biological mechanisms mediating gene action are critical for understanding the genetic regulation of a healthy lifespan and for personalizing medical care. © 2011 The Authors.

We applied a cumulative deficits approach to study this paradox, selecting 34 minor health deficits consistently measured in the 9th (1964) and 14th (1974) Framingham Heart and 5th (1991-1995) Offspring Study exams focusing on the 55-78 age range. We constructed four deficit indices (DIs) using all 34 deficits as well as subsets of these deficits characterizing males' (DIM) and females' (DIF) health disadvantages, and no relative sex-disadvantages. The DI34-specific age patterns are sex-insensitive within the 55-74 age range. The DI34, however, tends to selectively increase the risk of death for males. The DIF-associated health dimension supports the traditional morbidity paradox, whereas the DIM-associated dimension supports the inverse paradox, wherein males have worse health but better survival than females. The traditional paradox became less pronounced, whereas the inverse paradox became more pronounced from the 1960s to the 1990s. The sex-specific excess in minor health deficits may vary according to particular set of deficits, thus providing evidence for traditional and inverse morbidity paradoxes. The time-trends suggest the presence of a strong exogenous effect modifier affecting the rate of health deterioration and mortality risk. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management, Carnegie Mellon University, United States; McCall P.L., Department of Sociology and Anthropology, North Carolina State University, United States","Previous methodological research has shown that hidden heterogeneity in hazard rate regression models - in the form of systematic differences between sample members in the risk or hazard of making a transition due to unobserved variables not accounted for by the measured covariates - can produce biased parameter estimates and erroneous inferences. However, few empirical applications of hazard regression do more than pay lip service to the complications of hidden heterogeneity. In part, this is due to the relative inaccessibility of the mathematical apparatus of continuous-time hazard regression methodology with flexible nonparametric specifications on the hidden heterogeneity. This article presents new methods for incorporating nonparametric specifications of hidden heterogeneity into hazard regressions by developing discrete-time Poisson rate/complementary log-log hazard regression models with nonparametric hidden heterogeneity that are analogous to the continuous-time models of Heckman and Singer. Maximum-likelihood estimators and associated hypothesis tests are described. An empirical application to data on criminal careers, which illustrates the utility of models that explicitly incorporate hidden heterogeneity, is presented.","","","","","","","","","Agresti A., Categorical Data Analysis, (1990);

As a sub-stantive illustration, we apply our proposed methodology to data on verbal test scores from 15 cross-sections of the General Social Survey, 1974-2000.

Box 90088, United States","The question of whether boys or girls (and young males and females) have been doing better in terms of their well-being in the United States has been a point of sometimes rancorous debate among feminist and other scholars in recent decades. But suprisingly little systematic empirical inquiry has been devoted to this question. The present study addresses this general question and a number of related questions by application of a recently developed index of child and youth well-being to study trends in well-being. Specifically, sex-specific trends in 28 national-level time series social indicators in seven quality-of-life domains - material well-being, social relationships (with family and peers), health, safety/behavioral concerns, productive activity (educational attainments), place in community (participation in schooling or work),and emotional/spiritual well-being - are reviewed. These indicators are indexed by percentage change from a base year, 1985. Subsequent annual observations through the year 2001 are calculated as a percentage of the base year values. Domain specific summary indices as well as a summary overall well-being index are computed. The results are mixed - they show that for both boys and girls, some of the seven domains of well-being have improved since 1985, while others have deteriorated. Since 1995, overall well-being indices for boys and girls have shown significant improvement and 2001 levels were well above 1985 baseline figures. A direct comparison of male and female well-being reveals that the absolute level of gender differences in the summary well-being index decreased in the late 1980s, increased through the mid-1990s, peaked in 1997, and declined thereafter. It is concluded that gender differences in well-being, when they do exist, are very slight and that overall, both boys and girls in the United States currently enjoy a higher quality of life than they did in 1985. The findings are discussed in relation to recent debates in feminist literature. © Springer 2005.","Child well-being; Gender; Indices","North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; child welfare; gender disparity; quality of life; standard of living","","","","","Foundation for Child Development, FCD","The research reported here was supported by a grant from the Foundation for Child Development.","The AAUW Report: How Schools Shortchange Girls, (1992); Bianchi S.M., Feminization and juvenilization of poverty: Trends relative risks, causes, and consequences, Annual Review of Sociology, 25, (1999); Blumstein A., Wallman J., The Crime Drop in America, (2000); Buehler J.W., Kleinman J.C., Hogue C.J.E., Strauss L.T., Smith J.C., Birth weight-specific infant mortality United States 1960 and 1980, Public Health Reports, 102, pp. 151-161, (1987); Chavkin W., Romero D., Wise P.H., State welfare reform policies and declines in health insurance, American Journal of Public Health, 90, pp. 900-908, (2000); Cummains R.A., The domains of life satisfaction: An attempt to order chaos, Social Indicators Research, 38, pp. 303-328, (1996); Cummins R.A., Assessing quality of life, Quality of Life for Handicapped People, (1997); Folk K.F., Single mothers in various living arrangements: Differences in economic and time resources, The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 55, pp. 277-295, (1996); Freeman R.B., Does the Booming Economy Help Explain the Drop in Crime, (2000); Fried V.M., Prager K., MacKay A.P., Xia H., Chartbook on Trends in the Health of Americans, (2003); Gilligan C., In A Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, (1982); Gilman R.E., Huebner S.C., Laughlin J.E., A first study of the multidimensional students' life satisfaction scale with adolescents, Social Indicators Research, 52, pp. 135-160, (2000); Goodman E., The role of socioeconomic status gradients in explaining differences in adolescents' health, American Journal of Public Health, 89, pp. 1522-1528, (1999); Hack M., Wright L., Shankaran S., Tyson J.E., Horbar J.D., Bauer C.R., Younes N., Very-low birthweight outcomes of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Network November 1989 to October 1990, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 172, pp. 457-464, (1995); Hagerty M.R., Land K.C., Constructing summary indices of social well-being: A model for the effect of heterogeneous importance weights, (2004); Hernandez D.J., Poverty trends, Consequences of Growing Up Poor, (1997); Hogan D.P., Msall M.E., Rogers M.L., Avery R.C., Improved disability population estimates of functional limitations among American children aged 5-7, Maternal and Child Health Journal, 1, pp. 203-216, (1997); Holloway M., The aborted crime wave, (1999); Jazairi N.T., Index numbers, Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences, 4, pp. 54-62, (1983); Johnston L.D., O'Malley P.M., Bachman J.G., Monitoring the Future national survey results on drug use, 1975-2002.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The unique disability-focused National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) data that assessed the health and well-being of older individuals in 1994 were analyzed. PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand seven hundred ninety-one individuals in the 1994 survey. MEASUREMENTS: BMI (kg/m2) was calculated from self- or proxy reports of height and weight. The analysis was adjusted for 1-year change in BMI and demographic and health-related factors, as well as reports by proxies, and death occurring during the first 2 years after the interview. RESULTS: The relative risk of death as a function of BMI formed a nonsymmetric U-shaped pattern, with larger risks associated with lower BMI (<22.0) and minimal risks for BMI of 25.0 to 34.9. (BMI 22.0-24.9 was the reference.) Adjustments for demographic and health-related factors had little effect on this pattern. Nondisabled individuals exhibited a similar U-shaped pattern but with lower risks associated with lower BMI. For disabled individuals, the mortality-risk pattern was higher for lower BMI (<22.0) and flat for higher BMI, thus exhibiting an inverse J shape. BMI patterns were age sensitive, with disability status affecting sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Overweight or mild (grade 1) obesity was not a risk factor for 9-year mortality in older Americans participating in the 1994 NLTCS. A flatter BMI pattern of the relative risk of death for disabled than for nondisabled individuals suggests that optimal body weight can be sensitive to age and health and well-being. © 2008, The American Geriatrics Society.","Body mass index;

Third, while many of these contextual effects reported appear city-specific in that associated p values vary and represent different levels of statistical significance, further inspection and comparison across cities of the confidence intervals of the effects reveals substantive consistency.

These predictions are assessed with respect to a rarely studied form of delinquent/criminal behavior, cocaine use during the late-teenage and young adult years. We first examine the extent to which differential propensities toward antisocial behavior can be detected in a nationally representative sample of youth aged 14-16 in 1979. Based on self-reported delinquent and criminal activities in late adolescence, traditional cross-sectional latent-class analysis identifies three groups of antisocial/rebellious respondents and a group of non-offenders. We then follow these groups into early adulthood, examining age trajectories of cocaine usage between 1984 and 1998. Latent-class trajectory models identify clusters of respondents who show similar age trajectories of cocaine use over time and provide parameter estimates that predict membership in those clusters. In support of the population heterogeneity perspective, we find that antisocial/rebellious youth have higher probabilities of cocaine use throughout early adulthood than non-offending youth. There is, however, much variation in drug use patterns among the groups as they aged. In support of a life-course perspective, we find that social ties to schools, families, religion, and the labor market help differentiate youth who refrain from, maintain, or desist from using cocaine through early adulthood. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In Indian society, where cohabitation and childbearing are socially sanctioned only after marriage, the length of the first-birth interval affects the completed family size by influencing the spacing and childbearing pattern of a family. This study examines the influence of certain aspects of the status of married women education, employment, role in family decision making, and age at marriage along with three socioeconomic variables - per capita income of the family, social position of the household, and the caste system - on the duration of the first-birth interval in an urban Hindu society of the north-east Indian state of Assam. The data were analysed by applying life table and hazard regression techniques. The results indicate that a female's age at marriage, education, current age, role in decision making, and the per capita income of the household are the main covariates that strongly influence the length of the first-birth interval of Hindu females of urban Assam. Of all the covariates studied, a female's education appears to be a key mediating factor, through its influence on her probability of employment outside the home and thereby an earned income and on her role in family decision making. Unlike other Indian communities, the effect of the caste system does not have a significant effect on first-birth timing in this urban Hindu society.; This study examined determinants of first birth intervals (FBIs) among urban Hindu women in the northeastern state of Assam, India. Explanatory factors include women's status (education, employment, marriage age, role in family decision-making) and socioeconomic factors (family income, social position in the household, and caste). Data were obtained from a survey conducted in Guwati, the capital city of Assam, among 1650 eligible couples in 1991-92. Life table techniques and the guidelines of Rindfuss, Palmore, and Bumpass (1982) were followed to correct for censoring and sample selectivity. Analysis was based on Cox's hazard regression model. Findings indicate that mean age of marriage was about 21 years. Higher mean age at marriage was associated with education, wage earners, belonging to a higher monthly income group, having higher social status, and contributions to all household decisions. Marriage age varied more among low income groups, low status groups, those with little or no education, and those who do not take part in all household decisions. Life table techniques reveal that the median length of the FBI was under 16 months. Only 2% failed to give birth within 97 months of their marriage. In the full model with all 8 covariates, female occupation and position in the caste system did not have significant effects on FBI. Hazards of first births were higher when marriage age was under 17 years. Female education was negatively associated with first birth. Education delays marriage and increases the opportunity for paid employment.","","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Birth Intervals; Cultural Characteristics; Educational Status; Female; Fertility; Humans; Income; India; Life Tables; Male; Marriage; Proportional Hazards Models; Social Class; Urban Population; Women; Asia; Birth Intervals; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; First Birth Intervals--determinants; Hinduism; India; Marriage; Marriage Age; Marriage Patterns; Nuptiality; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Religion; Research Methodology; Research Report; Sampling Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Southern Asia; Studies; Surveys; Urban Population--women; Women's Status; adult; article; decision making; education; employment; family size; female; human; income; India; life table; male; normal human; pregnancy; social status; socioeconomics","","","","","","","Anker R., Research on women's role and demographic change, Survey Questionnaire for Household Women, Men and Communities with Background Explanations, (1982); Bumpass L., Age at marriage as a variable in socioeconomic differentials in fertility, Demography, 6, pp. 45-54, (1969); Caldwell J.C., Education as a factor in mortality decline: An examination of Nigerian data, Popul.

The Gln27Gln genotype increases risks of cancer, MI and IC, whereas the Glu27 allele or, equivalently, the Gly16Glu27 haplotype tends to be protective against these diseases. Genetic associations with longevity are of opposite nature at young-old and oldest-old ages highlighting the phenomenon of antagonistic pleiotropy. The mechanism of antagonistic pleiotropy is associated with an evolutionary-driven advantage of carriers of a derived Gln27 allele at younger ages and their survival disadvantage at older ages as a result of increased risks of cancer, MI and IC. The ADRB2 gene can play an important systemic role in healthy aging in evolutionary context that warrants exploration in other populations. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","ADRB2 polymorphisms; Framingham Heart Study; Healthy aging; Longevity","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aging; Alleles; Amino Acid Substitution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Health; Humans; Longevity; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2; Risk; Young Adult; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; adolescent; adult; aged; aging; article; atherosclerosis; cancer risk; cardiovascular risk; child; controlled study; DNA polymorphism; female; gene frequency; gene function; genetic variability; genotype; haplotype; heart infarction; heterozygosity; homozygosity; human; major clinical study; male; phenotype; pleiotropy; priority journal; risk assessment","","Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2, ","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (R01 AG-028259, R01-AG-030612, R01AG027019); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; Boston University, BU","The research reported in this paper was supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) grants R01 AG-028259 , R01-AG-027019 , and R01-AG-030612 .

This study utilizes social indicator time series regression models to determine if these trends are differentially affected by underlying structural factors. Structural factors, identified through application of Durkheimian anomie and social disintegration theses, include trends in economic status, marital status, household composition, government support programs, and cohort size. Findings indicate that (1) changes in family structure and relative cohort size contribute to the variation in the adolescent and young-adult white male suicide trends; (2) the suicide trends of the young-old white male population are associated with trends in elderly widowhood, Social Security benefits, and elderly cohort size; and (3) none of the social indicators included in this analysis explains the suicide trends among the old-old white male population. Therefore, these population subgroups are differentially affected through structural factors which are variably salient for specific groups at different stages in the life course. © 1994 Academic Press.","","","","","","","","","Ahlburg D.A., Schapiro M.O., Socioeconomic ramifications of changing cohort size: An analysis of U.S. postwar suicide rates by age and sex, Demography, 21, 1, pp. 97-105, (1984); Benson R.A., Brodie D.C., Suicide by overdoses of medicines among the aged, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 23, 7, pp. 304-308, (1975); Blazer D.G., Bachar J.R., Manton K.G., Suicide in late life: Review and commentary, Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 34, pp. 519-525, (1986); Bock E.W., Webber I.L., Social status and relational system of elderly suicides, Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 2, 3, pp. 145-162, (1972); Bock E.W., Webber I.L., Suicide among the elderly: Isolating widowhood and mitigating alternatives, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 34, pp. 24-31, (1972); Burr J.A., McCall P.L., Powell-Griner E., Catholic Religion and Suicide: The Mediating Effect of Divorce, ”, (1994); Carlson E., Divorce rate fluctuation as a cohort phenomenon, Population Studies, 33, pp. 523-536, (1979); Davis R.A., Female labor force participation, status integration and suicide, 19501969, Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 11, 2, pp. 111-123, (1981); Diekstra R.F., Suicide and suicide attempts in the european economic community: An analysis of trends, with special emphasis upon trends among the young, Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 15, 1, pp. 27-42, (1985); Dooley D., Catalano R., Serxner S., Economic stress and suicide: Multilevel analyses, part I.

Using a cumulative deficits approach, we investigated whether such improvements were evident at the level of minor health traits. Methods: We selected 37 small-effect traits consistently measured in the 9th (performed in 1964) and 14th (1974) Framingham Heart and 5th (1991-1995) Offspring Study exams to construct indices of cumulative deficits (DIs). Results: We identified deficits-specific DIs characterizing health dimensions associated with no health changes (DINHC), health worsening (DIWRS), and health improving (DIIMP) between the 1960s and 1990s. The risks of death attributable to the DINHC dominate within shorter time horizons. For longer time horizons, both the DINHC and DIIMP provide the same contribution to the risks of death. The mortality risks associated with the DIWRS are the weakest and least significant. Conclusions: The analyses show that the cumulative deficits approach might be an efficient tool for analyzing the effects of a large number of health characteristics for which the individual effects are small, inconsistent, or non-significant. They show favorable trends such that health of the Framingham studies participants either did not change or improved over time for the most serious small-effect traits. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of breastfeeding and the length of the preceding birth interval on early child mortality (defined as a death in the first two years of life) using data from a traditional society of India. Multivariate hazards models are used to analyze the data. Most prior analyses related the impact of breastfeeding duration to the duration of child survivability by taking breastfeeding as a fixed covariate. The present study has a methodological focus in the sense that breastfeeding information from retrospective survey data is treated as a time-dependent covariate both as a status variate as well as a duration--with empirical findings compared across the two specifications. The effects of postpartum amenorrhoea and various other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of mother and child are also studied. The results suggest that breastfeeding duration has a strong impact in reducing the relative risk of early child mortality; but it does not explain the effect of the length of the preceding birth interval on early child mortality.","","Birth Intervals; Breast Feeding; Humans; India; Infant; Infant Mortality; Proportional Hazards Models; Socioeconomic Factors; Age Factors; Asia; Birth Intervals; Breast Feeding; Child Mortality; Correlation Studies; Data Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; Health; India; Infant Nutrition; Maternal Age; Mortality; Multivariate Analysis; Nutrition; Parental Age; Parity; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Southern Asia; Statistical Studies; Studies; age; article; Asia; breast feeding; childhood mortality; correlational study; data analysis; Demographic Factors; developing country; Economic Factors; educational status; family planning; fertility; Fertility Measurements; health; human; India; infant; infant mortality; infant nutrition; maternal age; methodology; mortality; multivariate analysis; nutrition; parental age; parity; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; proportional hazards model; social status; socioeconomics; Southern Asia; Statistical Studies; Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0037766X","","","7761903","English","Soc Biol","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028511917"

One of the findings is that during the last two decades of the 20th century, the United States continued to exhibit shifts in the age distribution of both overall deaths and deaths from major degenerative diseases toward older ages. This is consistent with predictions from the fourth stage of the epidemiologic transition-the age of delayed degenerative diseases. Research on the dynamics of morbidity and mortality in medical demography shows that the age dependence of mortality risk can be substantially reduced or explained by taking into account several measures of physiological functioning. If the therapies have the effect of helping a larger fraction of elderly cohorts maintain their physiological parameters near the optimal values, this could reduce the age dependence of mortality and further raise life expectancy, which has implications for forecasts of the size and health status of the elderly population that are based on the medical demography model. Research in social demography, epidemiology, and medical sociology has greatly improved knowledge of how social, economic, and lifestyle/behavioral factors affect differentials in morbidity, disability, and mortality by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Using pooled cross-sectional time series analysis, different predictions are derived and tested from theories of secularization/social control, comparative disadvantage, resource mobilization, and pluralism. The effects of spatial diffusion and the momentum of religious tradition also are estimated. Our conclusion is that religious monopoly-not diversity-fuels religious expansion. This finding is bolstered by the complementary result that ethnic homogeneity is also conducive to religious expansion. Together these results highlight the importance for mobilization of religious and ethnocultural dominance in a particular niche. © 1992.","","","","","","","Program for Non-Profit Organizations; National Science Foundation, (SES-8907665); Yale University","Direct all correspondence to Judith R.

Are there significant sex differences? For closed-cohorts of males and females in different disability/functional-status status at age 65, how do their age and disability-specific functional statuses evolve with increasing age? These questions are addressed by analyzing multidimensional disability/mortality trajectories generated using a two-component stochastic process model applied to multivariate longitudinal data from the 1982 to 1994 National Long Term Care Surveys. In this model, one component process describes the temporal and age dynamics of a person’s functional state and the other describes the risk of death as a function of a person’s age and stochastically evolving position in the functional-status state space. Large differences were found in life expectancy among closed cohorts of persons who, at age 65, are in one of seven basic disability/functional-status states, identified by a multivariate analysis. Large differences between males and females in life expectancy for the origin-specific cohorts were also found. While females starting in most states tend to live longer, they are not as likely to return to the healthy, nondisabled state - females also tend to go into institutions at a higher rate than males.","","United States; disability; elderly population; mortality","","","","","","","Berkman B., Foster L.M.S., Campion E., Failure to thrive: Paradigm for the frail elder, The Gerontological Society of America, 29, 50, pp. 654-659, (1989); Katz S., Akpom C.A., A measure of primary sociobiological functions, International Journal of Health Services, 6, pp. 493-508, (1976); Katz S., Branch L.G., Branson M.H., Papsidero J.A., Beck J.C., Greer D.S., Active life expectance, New England Journal of Medicine, 309, pp. 1218-1223, (1983); Lawton M.P., Brody E.M., Assessment of older people: Self-maintaining and instrumental activities of daily living, Gerontology, 9, pp. 179-186, (1969); Manton K.G., Corder L.S., Stallard E., Estimates of change in chronic disability and institutional incidence and prevalence rates in the U.S. elderly population from the 1982, 1984, and 1989 National Long Term Care Survey, Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 47, 4, pp. S153-S166, (1993); Manton K.G., Land K.C., Active life expectancy estimates for the U.S. elderly population: A multidimensional continuous mixture model of functional change applied to completed cohorts, 1982-1996, Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, (1999); Manton K.G., Stallard E., Longevity in the United States: Age and sex specific evidence on life span limits from mortality patterns: 1960-1990, Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences, 51 A, 5, pp. B362-B375, (1996); Manton K.G., Stallard E., Corder L.S., The dynamics of dimensions of age related disability 1982 to 1994 in the U.S. elderly population, Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences, 53 A, 1, pp. B59-B70, (1998); Manton K.G., Stallard E., Singer B.H., Projecting the future size and health status of the U.S. elderly population, International Journal of Forecasting, 8, pp. 433-458, (1992); Manton K.G., Stallard E., Woodbury M.A., Dowd J.E., Time-varying covariates in models of human mortality and aging: Multidimensional generalization of the Gompertz, Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences, 49, pp. B169-B190, (1994); Manton K.G., Woodbury M.A., Tolley H.D., Statistical Applications Using Fuzzy Sets, (1994); Schoen R., Modeling Multigroup Populations, (1988); Tolley H.D., Manton K.G., Mortality models with health state variables, North American Actuarial Journal, (1998); Woodbury M.A., Manton K.G., Tolley H.D., A general model for statistical analysis using fuzzy sets: Sufficient conditions for identifiability and statistical properties, Information Sciences, 1, pp. 149-180, (1994)","","","","","","","","","03038300","","","","English","Soc.

Recently, scholars have introduced a model called Variance Function Regression for the study of the former problem, and a model called Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort regression has been developed for the study of the latter. This article presents an integration of these two models as a means to study the evolution of social inequalities along distinct temporal dimensions. We apply the integrated model to survey data on subjective health status. We find substantial age, period, and cohort effects, as well as gender differences, not only for the conditional mean of self-rated health (i.e., between-group disparities), but also for the variance in this mean (i.e., within-group disparities)-and it is detection of age, period, and cohort variations in the latter disparities that application of the integrated model permits. Net of effects of age and individual-level covariates, in recent decades, cohort differences in conditional means of self-rated health have been less important than period differences that cut across all cohorts. By contrast, cohort differences of variances in these conditional means have dominated period differences. In particular, post-baby boom birth cohorts show significant and increasing levels of within-group disparities. These findings illustrate how the integrated model provides a powerful framework through which to identify and study the evolution of variations in social inequalities across age, period, and cohort temporal dimensions. Accordingly, this model should be broadly applicable to the study of social inequality in many different substantive contexts. © American Sociological Association 2011.","health disparities; Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort Model; Hierarchical-Age-Period-Cohort-Variance-Function-Regression Model; Variance Function Regression Model","cohort analysis; detection method; health status; numerical model; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; variance analysis","","","","","","","Aitkin M., Modelling Variance Heterogeneity in Normal Regression Using GLIM, Applied Statistics, 36, pp. 332-339, (1987); Alwin D.F., History, Cohorts, and Patterns of Cognitive Aging, Aging and Cognition: Research Methodologies and Empirical Advances, pp. 9-38, (2009); Arber S., Cooper H., Gender Differences in Health in Later Life: The New Paradox?, Social Science and Medicine, 48, pp. 61-76, (1999); Bird C., Conrad P., Fremont A., Timmermans S., Handbook of Medical Sociology, (2010); Blau P.M., Duncan O.D., The American Occupational Structure, (1966); Bosworth H.B., Siegler I.C., Brummett B.H., Barefoot J.C., Williams R.B., Clapp-Channing N.E., Mark D.B., The Association between Self-Rated Health and Mortality in a Well-Characterized Sample of Coronary Artery Disease Patients, Medical Care, 37, pp. 1226-1236, (1999); Brodie M., Flournoy R.E., Altman D.E., Benson J.M., Rosenbaum M.D., Health Information, the Internet, and the Digital Divide, Health Affairs, 19, pp. 255-265, (2000); Case A., Deaton A., Broken Down by Work and Sex: How Our Health Declines, (2003); Case A., Paxson C., Sex Differences in Morbidity and Mortality, Demography, 42, pp. 189-214, (2005); Chen F., Yang Y., Liu G., Social Change and Socioeconomic Disparity in Health over the Life Course in China, American Sociological Review, 75, pp. 126-150, (2010); Crimmins E.M., Saito Y., Trends in Healthy Life Expectancy in the United States, 1970-1990: Gender, Racial, and Educational Differences, Social Science and Medicine, 52, pp. 1629-1641, (2001); Dannefer D., Cumulative Advantage/Disadvantage and the Life Course: Cross-Fertilizing Age and Social Science Theory, Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 58, (2003); Demidenko E., Mixed Models: Theory and Applications, (2004); Dupre M.E., Educational Differences in Age-Related Patterns of Disease: Reconsidering the Cumulative Disadvantage and Age-As-Leveler Hypotheses, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 48, pp. 1-15, (2007); Feldman J.J., Makuc D.M., Kleinman J.C., Cornoni-Huntley J., National Trends in Educational Differences in Mortality, American Journal of Epidemiology, 129, pp. 919-933, (1989); Fox J., Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models, (2008); Goesling B., The Rising Significance of Education for Health?, Social Forces, 85, pp. 1621-1644, (2007); Hays J.C., Schoenfeld D., Blazer D.G., Gold D.T., Global Self-Ratings of Health and Mortality: Hazard in the North Carolina Piedmont, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 49, pp. 969-979, (1996); House J.S., Lantz P.M., Herd P., Continuity and Change in the Social Stratification of Aging and Health over the Life Course: Evidence from a Nationally Representative Longitudinal Study from 1986 to 2001/2002 (Americans' Changing Lives Study), Journals of Gerontology: Series B 605B, SPEC.

We develop 14 criteria for determining the validity and usefulness of such QOL indexes to public policy. We then review 22 of the most-used QOL indexes from around the world. We conclude that many of the indexes are successful in that they are reliable, have established time series measures, and can be disaggregated to study subpopulations. However, many fall short in four areas: (1) indexes vary greatly in their coverage and definitions of domains of QOL, (2) none of the indexes distinguish among the concepts of input, throughput, and output that are used by public policy analysts, (3) they fail to show how QOL outputs are sensitive to public policy inputs, and (4) none have examined convergent validity against each other. We conclude that many of thèse indexes are potentially very useful for public policy, and recommend research to further improve them. © 2001, Sage Publications.

The model generates estimates for fertility parameters, such as the risk of conception, the risk of ovulation or withdrawal from using contraception, and the proportion of adolescent sterile females or couples using contraception. The model assumes homogeneity of risk of conception and a one-to-one correlation between conception and live birth. The model has the potential for further adjustment by incorporating a Pearsonian type III distribution and/or abortion as another possible outcome of a conception that may follow a geometric distribution pattern. The model is applied to data from 3931 rural households in Eastern Uttar Pradesh in India in 1987. None of the couples used contraception before the birth of the first child. The minimum chi square method is used to estimate the expected frequencies of important parameters in the model (the adolescent sterile group, the time spent by a woman in the adolescent sterility state in an exponential distribution, and the time spent in the ovulating state before conception in an exponential distribution). Findings indicate that the proposed model provides a good fit to the distribution of waiting time to first conception for marriage cohorts I and II. Findings indicate that it took 1.65 years and 1.54 years for women in the respective cohorts to reach the state of ovulation after marriage and 2.38 years and 1.72 years to reach first conception after ovulation. A comparison of this study's estimates with Talwar's estimates of nonfecund females shows, respectively, 74% and 78% of females aged 12-14 years being nonfecund in cohort I. 56% of study participants aged 15 in cohort II were estimated to be nonfecund compared to only 40% in Talwar's estimates.","","Age Factors; Asia; Birth Intervals; Birth Rate; Demography; Developing Countries; Fertility; India; Maternal Age; Models, Theoretical; Parents; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research; Age Factors; Asia; Birth Intervals; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Fertility; Fertility Measurements; First Birth Intervals; India; Maternal Age; Models, Theoretical; Natural Fertility; Parental Age; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Southern Asia; age; article; Asia; birth rate; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; family planning; fertility; Fertility Measurements; First Birth Intervals; India; maternal age; methodology; Natural Fertility; parent; parental age; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; research; Southern Asia; theoretical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00166987","","","12291264","English","Genus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029172010"

Properties and limitations of the corresponding Poisson and negative binomial (gamma mixtures of Poissons) regression models are described. It is shown how a misspecification of the mixing distribution of a mixed Poisson model to accommodate hidden heterogeneity ascribable to unobserved variables - although not affecting the consistency of maximum likelihood estimators of the Poisson mean rate parameter or its regression parameterization - can lead to inflated t ratios of regression coefficients and associated incorrect inferences. Then the recently developed semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator for regression models composed of arbitrary mixtures of Poisson processes is specified and further developed. It is concluded that the semiparametric mixed Poisson regression model adds considerable flexibility to Poisson-family regression models and provides opportunities for interpretation of empirical patterns not available in the conventional approaches.","","","","","","","","","Agresti A., Categorical Data Analysis, (1990); Allison P.D., Discrete-time methods for the analysis of event histories, Sociological Methodology 1982, pp. 61-98, (1982); GAUSS 3.0 System and Applications Manuals, (1992); Baker R.J., Nelder J.A., The GLIM System.

This multi-level, dynamic model is specified at the level of the state and for those states with nontrivial numbers of schools. Hypotheses that are tested include ones from organizational ecology, which predicts that annual foundings are a function of legitimation and competition, and institutional theory, which draws attention to public demand. It is also hypothesized that population of two-year colleges is responsive to business elites, affluence, the labor force needs of a diversified economy, and Democratic Party pluralities. The findings support these hypotheses and also suggest that business elites play an important role under the condition that there is a surplus of high school graduates in the state. © 2000 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","Andrew W.

In a study of the relation of socioeconomic status to disability-free or active life expectancy among older persons, we analyzed prospectively gathered data on 2219 blacks and 1838 whites who were 65 years of age or older in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. We defined disability as the inability to perform independently one or more basic functional activities such as walking, bathing, dressing, eating, and using the toilet. For subgroups defined by sex, race, and education, statistical models were used to estimate, for persons at each year of age, the probability of transition from not being disabled or being disabled at base line to not being disabled, being disabled, or having died one year later. These transition probabilities were then entered into increment-decrement life tables to generate estimates of total, active, and disabled life expectancy (with total life expectancy equal to active life expectancy plus disabled life expectancy). Results: Sixty-five-year-old black men had a lower total life expectancy (11.4 years) and active life expectancy (10 years) than white men (total life expectancy, 12.6 years; active life expectancy, 11.2 years), although the differences were reduced after we controlled for education. The estimates for 65-year-old black women (total life expectancy, 18.7 years; active life expectancy, 15.9 years) were similar to those for white women. Black men and women 75 years old and older had higher values for total life expectancy and active life expectancy than whites, and the differences were larger after stratification for education. Education had a substantially stronger relation to total life expectancy and active life expectancy than did race. At the age of 65, those with 12 or more years of education had an active life expectancy that was 2.4 to 3.9 years longer than the values for those with less education in all the four subgroups defined by sex and race. Overall, the subgroups with longer total life expectancy and active life expectancy also lived more years with a disability. Conclusions: Among older blacks and whites, the level of education, a measure of socioeconomic status, has a greater effect than race on total life expectancy and active life expectancy., People with lower socioeconomic status, as measured by indicators such as income, education, and occupation, have higher mortality rates than those with higher socioeconomic status1–5. Although health-related behavior and access to medical care contribute to it, this difference in mortality remains to be completely explained3,6–9. Differential mortality according to socioeconomic status has also been described among older populations10,11. There has been limited research on the effect of socioeconomic status on disability-free or active life expectancy12. Active life expectancy is computed with life-table methods to estimate the number of remaining years of life… © 1993, Massachusetts Medical Society.

Because annual changes in the shape of the fertility schedules often are approximately constant except in abnormal conditions, the Bongaarts-Feeney (B-F) method is generally robust for producing reasonable estimates of the adjusted TFR′(t). The adjusted TFR′(t) neither represents any real cohort experiences from the past nor forecasts any future trend. It merely provides an improved reading of the period fertility measure, which reduces the tempo distortion.","","Analysis of Variance; Bias (Epidemiology); Birth Rate; Female; Humans; Maternal Age; Models, Statistical; Pregnancy; Taiwan; United States; analysis of variance; article; birth rate; epidemiology; female; human; maternal age; pregnancy; statistical model; Taiwan; United States; validation study","","","","","","","Bongaarts J., The fertility impact of changes in the timing of childbearing in the developing world, Population Studies, 53, pp. 277-289, (1999); Bongaarts J., Feeney G., On the quantum and tempo of fertility, Population and Development Review, 24, pp. 271-291, (1998); Booth H., Transforming Gompertz's function for fertility analysis: The development of a standard for the relational Gompertz function, Population Studies, 38, pp. 495-506, (1984); Brass W., Note on brass method of fertility estimation, appendix A to chapter 3, The Demography of Tropical Africa, (1968); Perspectives in population prediction: Illustrated by the statistics of England and Wales, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 137 A, pp. 532-583, (1974); Methods of Estimating Fertility and Mortality From Limited and Defective Data, (1975); The Relational Gompertz Model of Fertility by Age of Women, (1978); Heuser R.L., Fertility Tables for Birth Cohorts by Color: United States 1917-73, pp. 76-1152, (1976); Kim Y.J., Schoen R., Changes in timing and the measurement of fertility, Population and Development Review, 26, pp. 554-559, (2000); Kohler H.-P., Philipov M., Variance effects in the Bongaarts-Feeney formula, Demography, 38, pp. 1-16, (2001); Paget W.J., Timaeus I.M., A relational Gompertz model of male fertility.

Based on Bayesian techniques, this method produces a subjective probability interval for the statistic, such as the mean of a response variable, that would have been calculated if all nonrespondents had responded. Demographic and socioeconomic background information that is recorded for both respondents and nonrespondents plays an important role in sharpening the subjective interval - through the adjustment of a regression equation that uses this information. In this article, Rubin's method-sometimes called the mixture modeling approach to drawing inferences from self-selected samples-is reviewed and applied to real survey and experimental data on community standards for sexually explicit material in which respondents were asked to judge the material's appeal to prurient interest and patent offensiveness (two of the three legal criteria for a determination of obscenity). A critically important substantive issue in this context is whether or not the sample self-selection processes governing the willingness of individuals to participate in the experiment have so truncated the frequency distributions of participant judgments about obscenity that they are grossly biased and inaccurate. It is shown how the mixture modeling approach sheds light on the possible extent of such biases. © 1993, SAGE PERIODICALS PRESS.

In recent years, a new round of research has been using annual time-series panel data from the 50 U.S. states for 25 or so years from the 1970s to the late 1990s that claims to find many lives saved through reductions in subsequent homicide rates after executions. This research, in turn, has produced a round of critiques, which concludes that these findings are not robust enough to model even small changes in specifications that yield dramatically different results. A principal reason for this sensitivity of the findings is that few state-years exist (about 1 percent of all state-years) in which six or more executions have occurred. To provide a different perspective, we focus on Texas, a state that has used the death penalty with sufficient frequency to make possible relatively stable estimates of the homicide response to executions. In addition, we narrow the observation intervals for recording executions and homicides from the annual calendar year to monthly intervals. Based on time-series analyses and independent-validation tests, our best-fitting model shows that, from January 1994 through December 2005, evidence exists of modest, short-term reductions in homicides in Texas in the first and fourth months that follow an execution - about 2.5 fewer homicides total. Another model suggests, however, that in addition to homicide reductions, some displacement of homicides may be possible from one month to another in the months after an execution, which reduces the total reduction in homicides after an execution to about.5 during a 12-month period. Implications for additional research and the need for future analysis and replication are discussed. © 2009 American Society of Criminology.","Deterrence; Displacement; Executions; Homicides","","","","","","","","Bailey W.C., Murder and capital punishment: An analysis of television execution publicity, American Sociological Review, 55, pp. 628-633, (1990); Bailey W.C., Deterrence, brutalization, and the death penalty: Another examination of Oklahoma's return to capital punishment, Criminology, 36, pp. 711-733, (1998); Bailey W.C., Peterson R.D., Murder and capital punishment: A monthly time series analysis of execution publicity, American Sociological Review, 54, pp. 722-743, (1989); Becker G.S., Crime and punishment: An economic approach, Journal of Political Economy, 76, pp. 169-217, (1968); Berk R., New claims about executions and general deterrence: Déjà vu all over again?, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, 2, pp. 303-330, (2005); Deterrence and Incapacitation: Estimating the Effects of Criminal Sanctions on Crime Rates., (1978); Boker S.M., Laurenceau J.-P., Dynamical systems modeling: An application to the regulation of intimacy and disclosure in marriage, Models for Intensive Longitudinal Data, (2006); Bowers W.J., Pierce G.L., Deterrence or brutalization: What is the effect of executions?, Crime and Delinquency, 26, pp. 453-484, (1980); Box G.E., Jenkins G., Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, (1976); Cloninger D.O., Marchesini R., Executions and deterrence: A quasi-controlled group experiment, Applied Economics, 35, pp. 569-576, (2001); Cochran J.K., Chamlin M.B., Deterrence and brutalization: The dual effects of executions, Justice Quarterly, 17, pp. 685-706, (2000); Cochran J.K., Chamlin M.B., Seth M., Deterrence or brutalization?

Specifically, annual homicide rates for 157 large US cities are analyzed for the 30 years from 1976 to 2005. We address the fundamental questions: Did all of cities experience similar levels and patterns of rise and decline in homicide rates over these three decades? Or is there hidden or unobserved heterogeneity with respect to these temporal patterns, thus leading to the identification of more homogeneous groupings of the cities? And if latent homogeneous groupings surface, is membership due to specific structural characteristics found within those cities? Evidence is found for the existence of four latent homicide rate trajectories. After identifying and classifying the cities into these four groups, multivariate statistical techniques are used to determine which social and economic characteristics are significant predictors of these distinct homicide trends. Criminal justice measures are also included as controls. It is found that larger cities located in the South with higher levels of resource deprivation/concentrated poverty, higher income inequality, higher percentages of the adult male population that are divorced, higher unemployment rates, higher percentages of youth, higher percentages of the population who are Hispanic and higher numbers of police per capita are more likely to be in a higher than a lower homicide trajectory group. Higher percentages of the population enrolled in colleges and universities and locations in states with higher incarceration rates are characteristics of cities associated with membership in a lower homicide trajectory group. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Homicide trends; Latent trajectory analysis","","","","","","","","Anderson E., Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City, (1999); Blau J., Blau P., Metropolitan structure and violent crime, American Sociological Review, 47, pp. 114-128, (1982); Blumstein A., Wallman J., The Crime Drop in America, (2001); Bollen K.A., Curran P.J., Latent Curve Models: A Structural Equation Perspective, (2006); Blumstein A., Rosenfeld R., Explaining recent trends in US homicide rates, Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 88, pp. 1175-1216, (1998); Bursik R.J., Social disorganization and theories of crime and delinquency: problems and prospects, Criminology, 26, pp. 519-551, (1988); Bursik R.J., Grasmick H., Neighborhoods and Crime: The Dimensions of Effective Community Control, (1993); Bushway S.D., Thornberry T.P., Krohn M.D., Desistance as a developmental process: a comparison of static and dynamic approaches, Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 19, 2, pp. 129-153, (2003); Cantor D., Land K.C., Unemployment and crime rates in the post-World War II United States: a theoretical and empirical analysis, American Sociological Review, 50, pp. 317-332, (1985); Chiricos T., Rates of crime and unemployment: an analysis of aggregate research evidence, Social Problems, 34, pp. 187-212, (1987); Cohen L.E., Felson M., Land K., Property crime rates in the United States: a macrodynamic analysis, 1947-1974, with ex ante forecasts for the mid-1980s, American Journal of Sociology, 86, pp. 90-118, (1980); Cohen L.E., Felson M., Social change and crime rate trends: a routine activity approach, American Sociological Review, 44, pp. 588-608, (1979); Cohen L.E., Land K.C., Age structure and crime: symmetry versus asymmetry and the projection of crime rates through the 1990s, American Sociological Review, 52, pp. 170-183, (1987); Cook P.J., Ludwig J., The social costs of gun ownership, Journal of Public Economics, 90, pp. 379-391, (2006); Fox J.A., Forecasting Crime Data: An Econometric Analysis, (1978); Fox J.A., Update on Trends in Juvenile Violence.

Did it improve or deteriorate? By how much? In which domains or areas of social life? For specific age groups? For particular race/ethnic groups? And did race/ethnic groups disparities increase or decrease? To address these questions, some 28 national-level time series of social indicators in seven quality-of-life domains - material well-being, social relationships (with family and peers), health, safety/behavioral concerns, productive activity (educational attainments), place in community (participation in schooling or work institutions), and emotional/spiritual well-being - are reviewed. Twenty-five of these time series date back to 1975 or earlier, while three are based on indicators that commenced in the 1980s. The 25 time series that date back to 1975 are indexed by percentage change from the base year 1975 - that is, subsequent annual observations are computed as percentages of the base year values. Similarly, all 28 time series that are available by 1985 also are indexed separately with 1985 as the base year. This is followed by the construction of seven domain-specific summary well-being indices in which each of the component time series in each of seven well-being domains are equally weighted. The seven component indices then are combined into two equally-weighted summary indices of child and youth well-being - the first of which is based on the 25 social indicator time series that date back to 1975 and the second of which is based on the 28 time series that date back to 1985. We also examine the impact of averaging the well-being indicators across the individual time series rather than across the seven quality of life domains. For this, we calculate corresponding base year 1975 and 1985 summary well-being indices that average equally across the individual component series. Basic findings about trends in child and youth well-being in the United States in the last quarter of the 20th century are shown to depend on both the base year and the formula by which the summary indices are calculated. Findings about child and youth well-being also are dependent upon the specific indicators and domains used in the composition of the summary indices. Using our general indices as metrics by which to measure change, we reach several conclusions. First, using 1975 as a base year - overall conditions of life for children and youths in the United States deteriorated fairly steadily for a number of years in the 1980s and reached low points in the early-1990s. From 1993, they then began an upturn that continued through 1998 towards, but still slightly below, 1975 levels. In other words, while some domains and conditions of life for children/youths improved by 1998 as compared to 1975, others deteriorated. Averaging across all of the domains of life and conditions included in our summary indices, the basic finding is that the overall quality of life of children/youths in the United States was not better in 1998 than in 1975. Using 1985 as a base year, the trend in overall well-being for children/youths shows a similar pattern of decline through the early-1990s followed by an improvement through 1998 to levels slightly above those of the 1985 base year. In other words, compared to 1985 base levels, average conditions of well-being for children/youths in the United States had slightly improved by the late-1990s. Additional findings are discussed pertaining to trends over time in each of the seven domains of well-being, trends within infancy, childhood, and adolescence/teenage age groupings, and trends in race/ethnic-group-specific comparisons and disparities.","","United States; child welfare; historical perspective; quality of life; socioeconomic indicator","","","","","Foundation for Child Development, FCD","1 The research reported in this paper was supported by a grant from the Foundation for Child Development.

This article (1) further describes the IE algebraically, geometrically, and verbally, (2) reviews properties of the IE as a statistical estimator, (3) provides model validation evidence for the IE both from an empirical example and from a simulation exercise, (4) relates the coefficients of the IE to those of conventional constrained APC models using formal definitions of statistical estimability, hypothesis testing, and empirical applications that directly address a criticism that often has been lodged at general-purpose methods of APC analysis, and (5) introduces computer software for application of the IE that interested users can readily access. The authors conclude that the IE holds the potential for applications not only to APC analysis but also to similar problems of structural underidentification in sociology. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

In particular, we address the way in which contextual indicators of ambient risk can affect individuals 'perceived risk and lifestyles through both main effects and moderating effects-where the latter cause the effects of individual-level factors on risk perception and routine activities to vary across residential communities. Results presented here suggest that increased levels of crime (as indicated by tract-level burglary rates) and disorganization (as indicated by high levels of neighborhood incivilities, for instance) have important direct positive effects on perceived crime risk, whereas neighborhood social integration decreases perceived risk. Further, tract-level crime rates have direct positive effects on protective behaviors, but community disorder, for the most part, does not lead to an increase in precautionary measures. Important moderating effects of crime and disorganization are also found. For instance, the tendency for non-Whites to perceive lower crime risk (or to feel less unsafe) than Whites is intensified in disorderly areas.","","article; criminal behavior; fear; human; risk assessment;

We present a new method to correct the bias and apply it to data from a longitudinal survey of about 9,000 oldest-old Chinese aged 80-105 collected in 1998 and 2000. In our application, the age trajectories of disability (activities of daily living-ADL), status-specific death rates, and the probabilities of transitions between ADL states of the oldest-old were investigated for the first time in a developing country. In this article, we report estimates of bias-corrected disabled and active life expectancies of the Chinese oldest-old and demonstrate patterns of large differences associated with initial status, gender, and advances in ages. Using combined information on ADL disabilities and length of having been bedridden before dying, we analyze gender and age patterns of the extent of morbidity before dying among the oldest-old and their implications for debates on the hypothesis of compression of morbidity.","","","","","","","National Institute on Aging, NIA, (P01AG008761); National Institute on Aging, NIA","","Andersen-Ranberg K., Vasegard L., Jeune B., Dementia is not inevitable: A population-based study of danish centenarians, Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, 56 B, (2001); Chen A.J., Jones G., Aging in ASEAN: Its Socioeconomic Consequences, (1989); Chiang C.L., A stochastic study of the life table and its application: II.

Social indicators are statistical time series ""used to monitor the social system, helping to identify changes and to guide intervention to alter the course of social change"". Examples include unemployment rates, crime rates, estimates of life expectancy, health status indices, school enrollment rates, average achievement scores, election voting rates, and measures of subjective well-being such as satisfaction with life-as-a-whole and with specific domains or aspects of life. This book provides a review of the historical development of the field including the history of QOL in medicine and mental health as well as the research related to quality-of-work-life (QWL) programs. It discusses several of QOL main concepts: happiness, positive psychology, and subjective wellbeing. Relations between spirituality and religiousness and QOL are examined as are the effects of educational attainment on QOL and marketing, and the associations with economic growth. The book goes on to investigate methodological approaches and issues that should be considered in measuring and analysing quality of life from a quantitative perspective. The final chapters are dedicated to research on elements of QOL in a broad range of countries and populations. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","","","","","","","","","","A.C.

Simmel's provocative and complex essay, ""Soziologie des Raumes"" (1903) poses the central paradox that religion is both faith - cultural constellations of beliefs - and church -social associations that are spatially situated. This distinction helps to clarify differences among denominations with regard to the extent to which they exert strong demands on their members, and leads to predictions about variation in denominational growth rates, in spatial dynamics, and in the extent to which denominations accommodate to contextual heterodoxy (diversity) or not. In these terms, we re-examine the debate about whether adherence rates increase in competitive markets (under conditions of diversity) or under monopoly conditions (under conditions of little diversity). We finally suggest that Simmel's theoretical emphasis on spatial and temporal dynamics has relevance for understanding the nature of mobilization efforts of various kinds, not only by religious groups, but also by those that organize social and political movements.","","","","","","","","","Baltzell E.D., The Protestant Establishment, (1964); Bellah R.N., Beyond Belief, (1970); Berger P., The Sacred Canopy, (1969); Blau J.R., The Shape of Culture, (1989); Land K.C., Redding K., The expansion of religious affiliation, Social Science Research, 21, pp. 329-352, (1992); Redding K., Land K.C., Ethnocultural cleavages and the growth of church membership, 1860-1930, Sociological Forum, 8, pp. 609-637, (1993); Bourdieu P., Distinction, (1984); Language and Symbolic Power, (1991); Boyer P., Urban Masses and Moral Order in America, 1820-1920, (1978); Breault K.D., New evidence on religious pluralism, urbanism and religious participation, American Sociological Review, 54, pp. 1056-1059, (1989); Reply to Finke and Stark, American Sociological Review, 54, pp. 1056-1059, (1989); Bruce S., Pluralism and religious vitality, Religion and Modernization, pp. 170-194, (1992); Chalfant H.P., Beckley R.E., Palmer C.E., Religion in Contemporary Society, 2nd Ed., (1987); Christiano K.J., Religious Diversity and Social Change, (1987); Coser L.A., Greedy Institutions, (1974); Coser R.L., The complexity of roles as a seedbed of individual autonomy, The Idea of Social Structure: Papers in Honor of Robert K.

These include: the limits of identities or universal laws as a basis for forecasts; the corresponding need for simplifying parametric representations of one or more of the variables that enter into identities; various sources of uncertainty about parameterizations; intrinsic limitations on predictability or forecasting accuracy in large-scale systems; the need for sensitivity analyses of model responses to changes in exogenous variables and/or parametric structures; problems of model linkage; and the social (organizational and political) context of forecasts. Suggestions for future lines of inquiry are made in each case. Several of these are such that they can benefit from a sharing of experience and expertise across disciplinary lines. © 1987 D.

After reviewing the record of annual changes in these indexes based on data from the National Health Interview Survey, patterns of temporal covariation in the time series are discussed and some tentative structural-equation models are constructed to account for their behavior. Statistically, the analyses reveal considerable variation in levels of year-to-year variance explained for these indexes-from 35 percent explained for days of school loss to 97 percent for all acute conditions. Substantive findings imply that a decreasing proportion of preschool children in the population contributes to a decline in the incidence of infective and parasitic diseases, and an increasing proportion of the population at the older ages results in increases in the prevalence of chronic conditions, days of bed disability, and days of restricted activity. Further, increases in economic prosperity lead to an increase in the incidence of injuries and a decrease in the incidence of viral conditions, while higher levels of unemployment produce more injuries and restricted activity days. These inferences corroborate, for the most part, results of prior studies that have been restricted to crosssectional analyses. In addition, however, they provide a basis for making explicit quantitative projections of future levels of morbidity and disability in the American population on the basis of exogenous demographic and socioeconomic conditions. © 1981 D.

This paper examines the validity of this structural distinctiveness hypothesis in the context of aggregate, time series data on male and female labor force participation in the post-World War II United States. Standard economic and sociological theories are used to specify sex-specific participation functions that contain indexes of the sex-specific general opportunity for employment, the sex-specific rates of participation in the armed forces and in postsecondary schooling institutions, the average real wage rate, the average number of hours worked, and the fertility rate. It is found that the female rate is more responsive than the male rate to the general employment opportunities and average hours indexes, but less responsive to the wage rate. Also, the female rate responds positively to the armed forces participation and college enrollment rates, whereas the male rate is negatively related to these indexes. However, no evidence is found for another component of the structural distinctiveness hypothesis, namely, that the fertility rate bears a consistent negative relationship to the female participation rate. While this relationship may have held during the early postwar years, it seems to have been substantially attentuated since the early 1960s. Prospects for convergence of the male and female participation functions are evaluated. Although current social trends suggest that the female function eventually will resemble more closely the male funtion, it is concluded that substantial sex differences are likely to persist for at least another decade. Implications of this for the structure of the labor force participation functions used in macroeconometric forecasting models are discussed. © 1980.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (RVDAHC 19-76-G-0016); Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, ARI","The hypothesis that the structure of the forces that affect male and female labor force participation rates are distinct has been corroborated in numerous studies using microdata.

This paper applies the term sensitivity analysis to methods for exploring how numerical parameter estimates depend upon the identifying assumptions in such models. Three ad hoc sensitivity analysis methods are identified that have been used in the literature: (1) estimation under alternative specifications, (2) trying out a range of numerical values of underidentified parameters, and (3) the use of algebraic inequalities to obtain bounds on sample estimates of parameters. Mathematical programming is introduced here as a fourth method generalizing the last procedure and is then applied to a specific numerical example. © 1978, Sage Publications.

The new methods combine multistate (increment–decrement) methods for those ages for which CPS data on enrollment flows are available together with prevalence-rate methods for other ages for which CPS data are available on enrollment stocks alone. Applying an algorithm to construct tables of school life for the 1969–1970, 1974–1975, 1979–1980, and 1984–1985 school years, it is found that, between the ages of 14 and 34, most sex-, race-, and school-year-specific groups have an average of 1.5 to 2.0 exits per person, from enrolled to not enrolled in school. These exits are interspersed by an average of .5 to 1.0 exits per person, from not enrolled to enrolled in school. Since prevalence-rate life-table methods arbitrarily constrain individuals to only one exit from school enrollment to not enrolled over the life course, this finding verifies the need for increment–decrement methods for the teenage and young-adult years. Several other findings regarding differentials in schooling life by sex and race and trends over time are discussed. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Demographic accounts; Demographic analysis; Increment–decrement life tables; Multistate life tables; School enrollment trends","","","","","","","","Hauser R.M., College Entry among Black High School Graduates: Family Income Does Not Explain the Decline, (1987); Hoem J., Fong M., A Markov Chain Model of Working Life Tables, (1976); Hoem J., Jensen U.F., Multistate Life Tables Methodology: A Probabilist Critique, Multidimensional Mathematical Demography, pp. 155-264, (1982); Land K.C., Hough G.C., Improving the Accuracy of Intercensal Estimates and Postcensal Projections of the Civilian Noninstitutional Population: A Parameterization of Institutional Prevalence Rates, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 81, pp. 62-74, (1986); Land K.C., Hough G.C., On the Combination of Prevalence Rate and Increment–Decrement Methods for Tables of School Life, with Applications to the 1969–70, 1974–75, 1979–80, and 1984–85 School Years, (1987); Land K.C., Hough G.C., McMillen M.M., New Midyear Age–Sex–Color Specific Estimates of the U.S. Population for the 1940s and 1950s: Including a Revision of Coverage Estimates for the 1940 and 1950 Censuses, Demography, 21, pp. 623-645, (1984); Land K.C., Hough G.C., McMillen M.M., Voting Status Life Tables for the United States, 19681980, Demography, 23, pp. 381-402, (1986); Land K.C., Rogers A., Multidimensional Mathematical Demography, (1982); Land K.C., Schoen R., Statistical Methods for Markov-Generated Increment–Decrement Life Tables With Polynomial Gross Flow Functions, Multidimensional Mathematical Demography, pp. 265-346, (1982); Mare R.D., Winship C., The Paradox of Lessening Racial Inequality and Joblessness Among Black Youth: Enrollment, Enlistment, and Employment, 1964-1981, American Sociological Review, 49, pp. 39-55, (1984); Rogers A., Ledent J., Increment–Decrement Life Tables: A Comment, Demography, 13, pp. 287-290, (1976); Schoen R., Further Reactions to Rogers and Ledents Comment, Demography, 14, pp. 591-592, (1977); Schoen R., Calculating Life Tables by Estimating Chiangs a From Observed Rates, Demography, 15, pp. 625-635, (1978); Schoen R., Land K.C., A General Algorithm for Estimating a Markov-Generated Increment–Decrement Life Table With Applications to Marital Status Patterns, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 74, pp. 761-776, (1979); Schoen R., Woodrow K., Labor Force Status Life Tables for the United States, 1972, Demography, 17, pp. 297-322, (1980); Smith S., Tables of Working Life: The Increment, (1982); Stockwell E.G., Nam C.B., Illustrative Tables of School Life, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 58, pp. 1113-1124, (1963); Willekens F.J., Multistate Analysis: Tables of Working Life, Environment and Planning, 12, pp. 563-588, (1980); Wolfbein S., The Length of Working Life, Population Studies, 3, pp. 286-294, (1949)","","","","","","","","","01621459","","","","English","J.

In this study we attempt to answer this fundamental question by identifying the theoretically motivated structural covariates which differentiate U.S. cities with extreme high and low crime rates. We apply discriminant function analysis across comprehensive samples of all U.S. cities with populations of greater than 25 000 in the periods 1960, 1970, and 1980 and then posit four question: are empirical findings from regression-based studies of city crime rates replicated in discriminant studies with extreme rates? Are the covariates that predict high or low crime rates unique to specific time periods? Which covariates are better able to discriminate high or low rates for specific crimes? And are specific covariates distinguishable in crime rate changes across time periods? Among our general findings, it appears that those cities with extreme high (low) crime rates tend to be the largest (smallest), most (least) economically deprived, and most (least) socially disintegrated. Associations with these latter two characteristics appear to have grown stronger over the past three census periods. The theoretical importance of these and other findings uncovered here are discussed and interpreted through Wilson's (1987) notion of concentration effects and social isolation which may have transformed inner-city areas in recent years. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","","","","","","","","Bailey, Poverty, inequality, and city homicide rates: Some not so unexpected findings, Criminology, 22, pp. 531-50, (1984); Baldwin, Thrill and adventure seeking and the age distribution of crime: Comment on Hirschi and Gottfredson, American Journal of Sociology, 90, pp. 1326-30, (1985); Blau, Blau, The cost of inequality: Metropolitan structure and violent crime, American Sociological Review, 47, pp. 114-29, (1982); Cohen, Felson, Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activities approach, American Sociological Review, 44, pp. 588-608, (1979); Cohen, Felson, Land, Property crime rates in the United States: A macrodynamic analysis, 1947–77, with Ex Ante forecasts for the mid-1980s, American Journal of Sociology, 86, pp. 90-118, (1980); Cohen, Kluegel, Land, Social inequality and predatory criminal victimization: An exposition and test of a formal theory, American Sociological Review, 46, pp. 505-24, (1981); Cohen, Land, Discrepancies between crime reports and crime surveys: Urban and structural determinants, Criminology, 22, pp. 499-530, (1984); Cohen, Land, Age structure and crime: Symmetry vs, asymmetry, and the projection of crime rates through the 1990s, American Sociological Review, 50, pp. 317-32, (1987); Cook, The demand and supply of criminal opportunities, Crime and Justice: An Annual Review of Research, Vol. 7, pp. 1-27, (1986); Decker D.L., Shichor D., O'Brien R.M., Urban Structure and Victimization, (1982); Gastil, Homicide and a regional culture of violence, American Sociological Review, 32, pp. 927-44, (1971); Gove, Hughes M., Geerken M., Are uniform crime reports a valid indicator of the Index crimes?

Current U.S. Bureau of the Census methods for making intercensal estimates and postcensal projections of the civilian noninstitutional population rest on the assumption that the age-, sex-, and race-specific proportions of the population that are institutionalized—as estimated by the last census—remain constant until the next census. This article examines the empirical validity of this assumption by using data from the decennial censuses for 1940–1980 and, in light of substantial decade to decade changes in the age patterns of the institutional proportions for sex- and race-specific populations, seeks to develop alternative methods. To pursue the latter objective, parametric curves are fit to the age-specific institutional proportions for each population for each decade. A study of the observed historical variation in the parameters of these curves then leads to some suggestions about how their shapes can be estimated between censuses and projected beyond the latest available census to provide more accurate estimates and projections of the civilian noninstitutional population. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Analytic graduation; Double-exponential parameterization; Institutionalized population prevalence rates; Population estimation and projection","Age Factors; Americas; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Ethnic Groups; Forecasting; Health Planning; Health Services Needs and Demand; Methods; North America; Organization and Administration; Population Growth; Research; Sex Factors; Statistics; United States; Age Factors; Americas; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Estimation Technics; Ethnic Groups; Methodological Studies; North America; Northern America; Organization And Administration; Population Growth Estimation; Population Projection; Program Design; Programs; Research Methodology; Sex Factors; Target Population; United States; age; article; developed country; developing country; Estimation Technics; ethnic group; forecasting; health care planning; health service; Methodological Studies; North America; Northern America; organization and management; population growth; Population Growth Estimation; Population Projection; Program Design; Programs; research; Research Methodology; sex difference; Target Population; technique; United States; Western Hemisphere","","","","","IC2 Institute; University of Texas; National Science Foundation, NSF, (SES-8218817)","* Kenneth C.

Military activities are divided into seven categories which parallel civilian institutional sectors: (1) economy and labor force, (2) education, (3) crime and deviance, (4) science and technology, (5) health and health care, (6) population and family, and (7) politics and government. In each activity area each of the following three topics is discussed: (1) impacts of civilian social changes on the military, (2) patterns of internal military change, (3) impacts of changes in the military on civilian society. For each topic in each category we briefly review some relevant issues, classifying references by the topics and categories to which they relate. © 1980 D.

An opportunity structures theoretical paradigm is applied to the specification of dynamic structural equations for determining changes (both trends and cyclical fluctuations) in marriage formation and dissolution, family and household composition, fertility, mortality, population growth, and population distribution. The equations are estimated on annual national data for the United States during the post-World War II years 1947 to 1972, and then they are used to make conditional forecasts of the values of some of the endogenous variables for 1973 and 1974. It is found that the equations fit the observed data well, lack demonstrable autocorrelation of disturbances, and forecast the 1973 and 1974 values usually with less than 2% error. Strategies are sketched for further refining some of the equations, and it is suggested that this model should be integrated into a larger societal model in order to estimate some of the effects of changes in demographic phenomena on other social conditions. © 1977.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Russell Sage Foundation, RSF","This is a revision of a paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, April 29-May 1, 1976, Montreal, Canada.

In each case, the major characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of the methods are described. Factors that place intrinsic limits on the accuracy of population forecasts are articulated. Promising lines of additional research by statisticians and demographers are identified for each class of methods and for population forecasting generally. © 1976 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cohort-component method; Demographic projections; Limits to forecast accuracy; Structural models; Time series models","Cohort Studies; Comparative Study; Demography; Forecasting; Methods; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Research Design; Statistics; Time Factors; Cohort Analysis; Comparative Studies; Demographic Factors; Estimation Technics; Measurement; Methodological Studies; Models, Theoretical; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Forecast; Population Projection; Reliability; Research Methodology; Time Factors; World; article; cohort analysis; Comparative Studies; comparative study; Demographic Factors; demography; Estimation Technics; forecasting; measurement; Methodological Studies; methodology; population; population dynamics; Population Forecast; Population Projection; reliability; reproducibility; research; Research Methodology; technique; theoretical model; time; World","","","","","IC2 Institute of the University of Texas at Austin; National Science Foundation, NSF, (SES-8218817a)","* Kenneth C.

After reviewing the record of annual changes in several general and cause - specific mortality indexes for the post-World War II United States, patterns of temporal covariation in the indexes are discussed and some tentative structural-equation models are described. Among other findings, these models indicate: (1) that changes in the age structure of the American population have substantial impacts on changes in mortality rates for diseases of the respiratory and circulatory systems as well as on deaths due to cirrhosis of the liver, accidents, and violence; (2) that the infective and parasitic diseases mortality rate is more closely related to per capita public health expenditures than to improvements in the general level of living in this post - war period; (3) that the business cycle, as indexed by the unemployment rate, has significant impacts on the cardiovascular, accident, and violence mortality rates; (4) that Brenner's finding of a positive association of an increase in the unemployment rate with an increase in cardiovascular diseases mortality two to three years later is partially mediated by an increase in per capita cigarette consumption during the economic recovery following a recession; (5) that an increase in the per capita level of cigarette consumption increases the respiratory systems mortality rate; (6) that both the general and the respiratory neoplasms mortality rates are more strongly affected by long-term moving averages of annual per capita levels of cigarette consumption than by single-years levels; (7) that the level of the degenerative diseases mortality rate is positively affected by an increase in per capita liquor consumption and negatively affected by an increase in health care utilization; (8) that the percentage of all vehicles traveling on highways at high speed is the exposure index most closely associated (of several that were studied) to the motor vehicle accident mortality rate; (9) that the levels of the maternal and infant mortality rates are positively related to an increase in the fertility rate (exposure) and negatively related to those advances in health care services associated with hospital births; (10) that the accuracy with which short-term changes in the crude mortality rate can be predicted from a knowledge of cause-specific mortality rates and how the latter are affected by societal conditions is effectively limited by the degree of accuracy of predictions of the respiratory diseases mortality rate because of its volatile influenza, pneumonia, and bronchitis component; and (11) that short-term changes in the life expectancy index can be somewhat more accurately predicted from such knowledge. Although most of these relationships have been noted before in mortality studies, only a small fraction have been studied in a macrodynamic structural-equation models context. These findings thus constitute a baseline of statistical evidence which can be explored in future research. © 1980 D.

Social indicators, usually are based on data that is demographic in form, if not in substance. As a numerical example of the workings of a demographic accounting system, we construct annual age-specific accounts for the United States residents female population, 1969-71. Despite the fact that such accounts do not exist for other populations, years, and social states of interest to social indicator analysts, we argue that a demographic accounting framework provides a conceptual system for organizing available indicators so as to identify the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the data. Further, by using the underlying population transformation equation of demographic accounting, sources and processes of temporal changes in social indicators can be identified. -Authors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0019193822"

Parameters of the functional relationship of migration probabilities to duration status are estimated from migration histories for a sample of residents in Monterrey, Mexico, and compared with estimates reported by P. A. Morrison using data from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In both data sets a negative nonlinear relation of the probability of migrating to duration status, as well as an interaction between age and duration status, is found. Values of parameters describing the relation within age groups differ sufficiently between the two data sets, however, to suggest that further specification of conditions under which a particular form of functional relation will obtain is necessary if the model is to be useful in migration research. © 1969 Population Association of America.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15337790","","","","English","Demography","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0242483778"

After updating and extending several time series of occupational indicators used by these authors and adding some others as well, the authors specify and estimate a number of dynamic structural-equation models to explain changes in the occupational system as indexed by the social indicators. These equations indicate: (1) that Bell's thesis about a shift from a production of goods orientation to a performance of services orientation in post-war American society needs to be qualified; (2) that the shift is due more to increased productivity in argriculture rather than in industry; (3) that increased bureaucratization of employment results, in part, from the shift out of agriculture and other post-war trends in the technological and organizational context of the work environment; and (4) that societal investments in military technology and in scientific research and development have had an important impact upon the occupational system in terms of shifting upwards the distribution of occupations with respect to prestige. In each of the topics analyzed, the authors make suggestions for developing additional indicators and for refining the structural equations. In addition, the potential of these equations for social forecasting is considered. © 1977 D.

A cross-section of residents of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte, NC) were randomly assigned to view either one of the sexually explicit films and the sexually explicit magazine charged in the criminal case, or a control film. Before and after the viewing, residents judged the materials' appeal to a prurient interest (a shameful, morbid, unhealthy interest in sex) and patent offen siveness (community tolerance for such material). The results indicated that the respondents felt that the films and magazine did not appeal to a shameful, morbid, or unhealthy interest in sex, nor did they perceive these materials as going beyond the level of tolerance regarding depictions of sexual conduct for the average adult in that community. A lower percentage of subjects thought the community tolerated the materials they had just viewed than when they were asked to report on what they personally tolerated. Fewer people felt the films appealed to a shameful, morbid, or unhealthy interest in sex after they had an opportunity to see them than before viewing. The advantages of providing jurors in obscenity cases with information about community standards based on summations of personal tolerance for materials actually charged in these cases, rather than hypothetical judgments about the community and obscenity, is discussed. © 1991 by the American Association for Public Opinion Research.","","","","","","","","","Bantam Books Inc.

It also presents the corresponding implied coverage estimates for the 1940 and 1950 censuses. The new population estimates are calculated by combining the most recent figures on the 1960 population with estimates of the demographic components of change for the 1950s and 1940s in an iterative reverse cohort-component projection algorithm. Among the principal findings of the new estimates are: (a) existing midyear estimates of the ""true"" population in the 1950s are 450,000 to 500,000 too high; (b) existing age-specific estimates for the 1950s tend to underestimate the population at the older ages (55 years and over) and overestimate the population in the young and middle adult years (15 to 54 years); (c) estimates of the ""true"" population in the 1940s were too low except for nonwhites at ages 65 and over; (d) existing estimates of percentage net undercount and underenumeration for the 1950 and 1940 censuses tend to be too high, substantially so for nonwhites in the 1940 Census; and (e) nonwhites were more completely enumerated in 1940 than in 1950. Thus, in addition to being methodologically and temporally consistent with post-1960 estimates, the new population estimates described here imply some substantial revisions in demographic, social, and economic statistics for the two decades prior to 1960. © 1984 Population Association of America.","","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Blacks; Child; Child, Preschool; Demography; Female; Human; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Age; Population; Sex Ratio; United States; Whites; adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; Caucasian; child; demography; female; human; infant; male; negro; newborn; population; preschool child; sex ratio; United States","","","","","","","Clegg C., Measuring Unemployment: Demographic Indicators for the United States, (1979); Coale A.J., The Population of the United States in 1950Classified by Age, Sex, and Color-A Revision of Census Figures, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 50, pp. 16-54, (1955); Coale A.J., Rives N.W., A Statistical Reconstruction of the Black Population of the United States 1880–1970: Estimates of True Numbers by Age and Sex, Birth Rates, and Total Fertility, Population Index, 39, pp. 3-36, (1973); Coale A.J., Zelnick M., New Estimates of Fertility and Population in the United States, (1963); Keyfitz N., Flieger W., Population.

Using the 26 large central cities for which data on both types of rates are available, we analyze the extent to which discrepancies between the rates can be accounted for by aspects of urban social structure that differ from city to city. After introducing such structural controls, we find a much closer correspondence between the two types of rates for motor vehicle theft, robbery, burglary, and forcible rape, but not for aggravated assault and larceny‐theft. These results are explained by citing evidence that we have identified some critical “suppressor” variables for the former crimes (i.e., variables that are positively associated with one type of rate and negatively associated with the other). By contrast, the heterogeneous nature of the phenomena subsumed by the latter two crime categories may preclude identification of a similarly parsimonious list of suppressors. One implication of these conclusions is that cross‐sectional analyses of intercity variation in official rates may produce results that are in reasonably close correspondence with what would be obtained with victimization rates for certain index crimes, provided that sufficient structural control variables are utilized.

On the basis of recently published data of nine-year cumulative records of all one-year United States marriage cohorts, 1949–1958, it is found that the one-parameter model does not provide an empirically adequate representation of cohort divorce trajectories. Therefore, two modifications of the basic model are explored. First, it is assumed that the longer the couples remain married the smaller is the probability of their becoming divorced (a cumulative inertia modification). Second, it is assumed that the cohort can be divided into two groups one of which is subject to risk of divorce while the other is not (a mover-stayer modification). It is concluded that the latter model provides a better approximation to the empirically observed divorce trajectories. Given availability of disaggregated observations of divorces for marriage cohorts, the model could be used as a mathematical language for the construction of a theory of divorce differentials and changes in the divorce condition over time. © 1971, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

As compared to regular procedures for juvenile court protective supervision of status offenders, the Intensive Protective Supervision Project (IPSP) involves more extensive and proactive contact between the court counselor, the status offender, and the status offender's family. The essential idea of the IPSP is that through the intensive supervision and provision of professional services to status offenders it may be possible to decrease the rate of occurrence of additional status offenses and the likelihood that the youths will commit more serious delinquent offenses. Results from a statistical and field-based evalu ation of the IPSP experiment suggest that the project is quite successful in achieving its goals for those undisciplined youths who have not previously been charged with delinquent offenses. © 1990, Sage Publications.
