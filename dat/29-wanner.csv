The quality of the available data is discussed in regard of various criteria (type of statistics, representativness, frequency of data collection, diffusion, comparability, concern for validation). Two examples are presented: 1.) The incidence of low birthweight shows how a hospital-based statistics indicator can accurratery reflect a trend over time, but provide a biased estimation of a risk level. 2.) The evolution of several indicators concerning drug consumption shows how important it is to validate these indicators in order to allow an adequate interpretation. Such a validation is seldom made. The present situation could be improved by a more efficient structure of the canton's health statistics.","","Data Collection; Drug Utilization; Health Policy; Health Surveys; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Population Surveillance; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Switzerland; Vital Statistics; article; drug utilization; health care policy; health survey; human; information processing; low birth weight; newborn; reproducibility; risk assessment; Switzerland; vital statistics; data analysis; drug use; health care policy; health statistics; information system; monitoring; public health; switzerland","","","","","","","Weiss W., La Santé en Suisse, (1993); Institut suisse de la santé publique et des hôpitaux.

Taking advantage of the Swiss statistical system, which records residents' religion in the census and in vital records, the mortality differentials over the period 1991-2004 are analysed according to self-reported religious affiliation. Using record linkage techniques, it is possible not only to assess the quality of these data with a view to correcting aggregate estimates, but also to adopt an individualized and multivariate approach to the relation between religion and mortality by cause of death. The analysis reveals significant survival differentials between religious groups, probably linked to differences in lifestyle. A sociological interpretation of the results supports the hypothesis of a mortality gradient by degree of religiosity in Switzerland.","","Switzerland; cause of death; historical perspective; minority group; mortality; religion; survival","","","","","","","Allison Paul D., Survival Analysis Using the SAS System: A Practical Guide, (2001); Alter G., Height, frailty, and the standard of living: Modelling the effects of diet and disease on declining mortality and increasing height, Population Studies, 58, 3, pp. 265-279, (2004); Becci I., Bovay C., Attitudes et pratiques religieuses: La perméabilité du religieux privé et public, Vivre en Suisse 1999-2000, pp. 207-235, (2004); Bopp M., Spoerri A., Zwahlen M., Gutzwiller F., Paccaud F., Braun-Fahrlander C., Rougemont A., Egger M., Cohort profile: The Swiss National Cohort - A longitudinal study of 6.8 million people, International Journal of Epidemiology, 38, 2, pp. 1-6, (2008); Bovay C., Broquet R., Le Paysage Religieux en Suisse.

Thus, attributable death of the smoking habits have for effect to decrease the life expectancy of swiss citizens of 2.9 years for men and 0.7 years for women, for the period 1988/1993. The calculation of mortality rates attributable to this factor of risk shows nevertheless that the risk of death has decreased since the end of years 1960 for all quinquennial age groups between 35 and 74 years. The smoking habits would be responsible of approximately 16% of deaths observed in the swiss population and 20%, of premature deaths (between 25 and 64 years). The present analysis shows furthermore that different evolutions of the mortality associated with the smoking habits characterize men and women.","","Adult; Aged; Cause of Death; Female; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Smoking; Switzerland; adult; article; female; health hazard; human; lifespan; major clinical study; male; mortality; prevalence; risk assessment; sex difference; smoking; switzerland","","","","","","","Tables de Mortalité 1988/93, (1996); Bulletin de l'Office Fédéral de la Santé Publique, 8, pp. 101-105, (1992); La Vecchia C., Levi F., Gutzwiller F., Fumée et santé: Une épidémie évitable, Médecine et Hygiène, 45, pp. 3453-3462, (1987); Schweizerische Fachstelle für Alkohol- und Andere Drogenprobleme.

Until now, little attention has been paid to changes in the country of origin. Thus, this article focused on three events that may have affected the naturalization of foreign nationals living in Switzerland: recognition of dual nationality, EU accession, and the euro debt crisis. It aims to shed light on naturalization practices by comparing the evolution of naturalization rates throughout periods before and after these changes occurred in the country of origin. Results show that the recognition of dual nationality is likely to have an increased interest in naturalization on a long-term basis, while the new UE Member States’ naturalization rate decreased and converged towards the European rate. The impact of the economic crisis is more questionable. © 2023, University of Poitiers.

We know that family transitions are closely tied to residential relocation, but the extent to which they might explain differential mobility patterns among immigrant and native-born populations is still largely unknown. OBJECTIVE/METHODS Using Swiss administrative registers and a nationally representative survey, we apply discrete-time logistic models to assess whether residential mobility responses to family changes differ between immigrant and native-born populations. We highlight various patterns of housing adjustment at times of childbirth, marriage (among cohabiting and non-cohabiting partners), and divorce. We also investigate the factors accounting for the differences between foreign- and native-born groups. RESULTS/CONTRIBUTIONS The results suggest that residential mobility increases at times of childbirth, marriage, and divorce for both native- and foreign-born populations living in Switzerland. The results also suggest that the timing and intensity of residential changes in response to (or in anticipation of) family transitions differ across groups according to their birthplace. Compared to native-born residents, immigrants prove to be more residentially mobile at the time of marriage, owing to specific pre-marital cohabitation behaviours, but less residentially mobile at the time of childbirth, an event inherently linked to housing improvement. Household income was identified as an important mitigating factor within the joint processes of family changes and residential mobility. © 2020, Demographic Research.

More than half of recent migrants have reported experiencing prejudice or discriminatory practices in the last 24 months. Methods: Based on a 2018 survey of 7,740 adult migrants (aged 24-64) who arrived in Switzerland in 2006 or later, we examine whether self-reported health is statistically associated with the perception of being a victim of prejudice or discrimination. Ordered logistic regressions are estimated using two indicators of discrimination: the frequency of discrimination and the number of places where discrimination occurs. Results: The regression results show that discrimination, which is not necessarily based on ethnicity or migrant status, is associated with health status, even after controlling for possible confounding factors. Discussion: Our results confirm those already observed in other countries of immigration. They suggest a likely association between perceived discrimination and self-reported health. © 2023 The Author(s)","Discrimination; Migrants; Self-reported health; Switzerland","adult; article; confounding variable; ethnicity; female; frequency discrimination; health status; human; human experiment; immigration; male; migrant; perceived discrimination; perception; prejudice; Switzerland; victim; young adult","","","","","National Center of Competence in Research nccr; Swiss Federal Statistical Office, (160462); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; NCCR Catalysis, NCCR","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the National Centre of Competence in Research “nccr – on the move” funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the National Center of Competence in Research nccr – on the move funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Design and Sample: This study is a secondary data analysis of the Swiss Health Survey 2002, a cross-sectional survey. In total, 19,249 individuals living in Switzerland were included. Measures: The prevalence of hypertension, high cholesterol level, smoking, diabetes, overweight, low fruit and vegetable intake, and physical inactivity were calculated for major immigrant groups and Swiss nationals. Demographic data were used to control for age and socioeconomic status. Results: Major immigrant groups were people from Italy, Germany, former Yugoslavia, Spain, Portugal, France, and Turkey. Compared with Swiss women, women from former Yugoslavia were more likely to have hypertension, and women from Germany were more likely to have high cholesterol levels. Women from Italy, former Yugoslavia, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey were more likely to show physical inactivity and (except Turkish women) to be overweight. Men from these countries (except Spanish men) were more likely to be overweight than Swiss men. Conclusions: Differences exist in the prevalence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors between Swiss nationals and many of the immigrant groups. Age and socioeconomic status could only partly explain the differences. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Cardiovascular diseases; Cross-sectional studies; Immigrants; Prevalence; Risk factors","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Confidence Intervals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigrants and Immigrants; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Status Disparities; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Self Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Switzerland; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; cardiovascular disease; confidence interval; cross-sectional study; ethnic group; female; health disparity; health survey; human; male; middle aged; migration; prevalence; risk; risk factor; self report; socioeconomics; statistics; Switzerland","","","","","","","Bader A., Musshauser D., Sahin F., Bezirkan H., Hochleitner M., The Mosque Campaign, Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift, 118, 7-8, pp. 217-223, (2006); Bischoff A., Wanner P., The self-reported health of immigrant groups in Switzerland, Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health, 10, 4, pp. 325-335, (2008); Bhopal R., Chronic diseases in Europe's migrant and ethnic minorities, European Journal of Public Health, 19, 2, pp. 140-143, (2009); Cappuccio F.P., Cook D.G., Atkinson R.W., Strazzullo P., Prevalence, detection, and management of cardiovascular risk factors in different ethnic groups in south London, Heart, 78, 6, pp. 555-563, (1997); Epping-Jordan J., Galea G., Tukuitonga C., Beaglehole R., Preventing chronic diseases, Lancet, 334, pp. 1667-1671, (2005); (2007); Fiscella K., Improving healthcare quality for minority patients, Using existing measures to monitor minority health care quality, (2001); Gabadinho A., Dahinden J., La santé des populations migrantes en Suisse: une analyse des données du GMM, (2007); Gadd M., Sundquist J., Johansson S.E., Wandell P., Do immigrants have an increased prevalence of unhealthy behaviours and risk factors for coronary heart disease?, European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation, 12, 6, pp. 535-541, (2005); Gorber S.C., Tremblay M., Mohrer D., Gorber B., A comparison of direct vs. self-reported measures for assessing height, weight and body mass index, Obesity Reviews, 8, 4, pp. 307-326, (2007); Graham I., Atar D., Borch-Hohnsen K., Boysen G., Burell G., Cifkova R., Et al., European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation 2007, 14, SUPPL. 2, (2007); Huisman M., Kunst A.E., Bopp M., Borgan J.K., Borrell C., Costa G., Et al., Educational inequalities in cause-specific mortality in middle-aged and older men and women in eight western European populations, Lancet, 365, 9458, pp. 493-500, (2005); Huwiler K., Bichsel M., Junker C., Minder C.E., Calmonte R., Soziale Ungleichheit und Gesundheit in der Schweiz: Eine Spezialauswertung der Gesundheitsbefragung 1997, (2002); Lemic-Stojcevic N., Dundas R., Jenkins S., Rudd A., Wolfe C., Preventable risk factors for coronary heart disease and stroke amongst ethnic groups in London, Ethnicity and Health, 6, 2, pp. 87-94, (2001); Mackay J., Mensah G., The atlas of heart disease and stroke, (2004); Mladovsky P., A framework for analysing migrant health policies in Europe, Health Policy, 93, 1, pp. 55-63, (2009); Pudaric S., Sundquist J., Johansson S.E., Major risk factors for cardiovascular disease in elderly migrants in Sweden, Ethnicity and Health, 5, 2, pp. 137-150, (2000); Rausa F., Reist S., Capezzali E., Farine A., Murier T., Junker C., Et al., Ausländerinnen und Ausländer in der Schweiz.

However, traditional data sources fail to provide immediate information on migration flows and do not facilitate the correct anticipation of these flows in the short term. To tackle this issue, this paper evaluates the predictive capacity of big data to estimate the current level or to predict short-term flows. The results show that Google Trends can provide information that reflects the attractiveness of Switzerland for to immigrants from different countries and predict, to some extent, current and future (short-term) migration flows of adults arriving from Spain or Italy. However, the predictions appear not to be satisfactory for other flows (from France and Germany).

Although implemented by many countries in recent years, research has neglected the effect of integration policy reform packages combining economic and social policy measures on asylum-related immigrants’ adjustment processes. Exploiting a comprehensive integration policy reform in Switzerland, using survey data from the Health Monitoring of the Swiss Migrant Population, and registering data on the whole asylum-related population, our difference-in-differences analyses reveal that provisionally admitted individuals benefiting from the reform have higher employment probability, increased income levels, better language skills, and feel less lonely or without a homeland relative to comparable asylum seekers who did not benefit from the reform. Robustness checks assessing common pre-reform trends support our findings, which highlight the importance of evaluating entire reform packages when assessing integration policies’ effectiveness. © 2022 The Authors.

To identify health issues in which to intervene, this study analysed the impact of a mother’s lack of legal status, together with available biological and socioeconomic characteristics, on four indicators of adverse perinatal outcomes in Switzerland. Methods: Based on the exhaustive records of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO) for its Vital Statistics (BEVNAT), different indicators of birth outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB), low and very low birth weight (LBW and VLBW), and small for gestational age (SGA), were analysed using logistic regressions on live births occurring from 2005 to 2018. These four adverse outcomes were defined as dependent variables. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical package STATA, version 17. Results: Selected pregnancy outcomes were conversely affected by an irregular legal status. Analysis run on the final sample showed that, compared to the neonates of mothers who are non-migrant legal residents in Switzerland, newborns of irregular migrants have higher risks of PTB (aOR 1.18 95% CI [1.05-1.32], p<0.01) and VLBW (aOR 1.43 [1.13-1.81], p < 0.01]). In contrast, we observed that in both irregular and regular migrant groups, the odds of SGA were lowered (aOR.76 [.68-.85] p<0.01) and aOR.93 [.91-.94], p< 0.01, respectively). A similar effect was observed when controlling for any adverse outcome (any AOs) (aOR .90 [.83-.99] p 0.022; and aOR.93 [.91-.94] p< 0.01, respectively). Conclusions: Our results, together with those from the available literature, call for a more comprehensive assessment of all pregnancy outcomes as well as of the social determinants of health for which the analysis was adjusted. Given the complexity of the migration phenomenon, future studies should account for local structural restrictions in the organization of care, the extension of a person’s network as a means of health care accessibility, diverse backgrounds and cultures and the recent arrival status of migrants. This would allow researchers to understand the long-term impact of social determinants of health on the wellbeing of a mother and child and take them into account in the adoption of health policies. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Health care disparities (MeSH); Irregular migrants; Low and very low birth weight; Maternal-child Health Services (MeSH); Preterm birth; Small for gestational age; Switzerland (MeSH)","Child; Ethnicity; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Live Birth; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Risk Factors; Switzerland; Article; female; health care access; health care disparity; health care organization; health care policy; human; legal aspect; live birth; low birth weight; perinatal period; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; small for gestational age; social determinants of health; Switzerland; very low birth weight; child; ethnicity; intrauterine growth retardation; live birth; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; risk factor; very low birth weight","","","","","Swiss National Fund for Scientific Research, (51NF40–182897); Botnar Research Centre for Child Health, University of Basel, BRCCH","Open access funding provided by University of Basel.

The characteristics of the level and trends of mortality in the cantons are described here by the decomposition methods developed by Pollard and Arriaga. The pace of the development of mortality in the cantons is compared, and the particular characteristics observed are accounted for by life table analysis according to age and cause of death. The results show in particular the dominant role played at economically active ages and beyond in recent mortality trends, and the importance of AIDS and of violent deaths in accounting for differences between cantons. The analysis is concluded by a discussion of the main results obtained.","","Cause of Death; Demography; Developed Countries; Europe; Geography; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Longevity; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Research; Switzerland; Switzerland; Age Specific Death Rate; Causes Of Death; Comparative Studies; Death Rate; Demographic Analysis; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Europe; Geographic Factors; Length Of Life; Life Expectancy--changes; Life Table Method; Life Tables; Mortality; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Studies; Switzerland; Western Europe; AIDS; cause of death; mortality trends; population change; violent death; Age Specific Death Rate; article; cause of death; Causes Of Death; comparative study; Demographic Factors; demography; developed country; Europe; Geographic Factors; geography; Length Of Life; life expectancy; Life Expectancy--changes; life table; life table method; longevity; methodology; mortality; population; population dynamics; research; Studies; Switzerland; Western Europe","","","","","","","Anson J., Regional mortality differences in Britain, 1931-87: A two dimensional analysis, Journal of Biosocial Science, 25, 3, pp. 383-395, (1993); Arriaga E.E., Measuring and explaining the change in life expectancies, Demography, 21, 1, pp. 83-96, (1984); Bopp M., Schuler G., Neue Ansätze zur geographischen Mortalitätsanalyse, Forschung und Dokumentation, (1997); Vieillir en Suisse.

Based on data from the Migration-Mobility Survey 2016, our empirical analysis has two goals. First, it measures the incidence of educational and skills mismatches among different groups of recent immigrants according to their origin and status of foreign credential recognition. Second, it investigates whether the recognition of foreign qualification improves access to the labour market by reducing the risk of being mismatched in education or skills. Results show that recent migrants face the lowest risk of educational and skills mismatches when holding a Swiss diploma or having obtained recognition of foreign credentials. Although our analytical approach does not allow us to identify causal relationships, credential recognition seems to play a beneficial role in the immigrants’ assimilation process. © The Author(s) 2019.","Educational mismatch; Labour market; Migrants’ integration; Recognition of foreign credentials; Skills mismatch","","","","","","","","Aleksynska M., Tritah A., Occupation-education mismatch of immigrant workers in Europe: Context and policies, Economics of Education Review, 36, pp. 229-244, (2013); Allen J., van der Velden R., Educational mismatches versus skill mismatches: Effects on wages, job satisfaction, and on-the-job search, Oxford Economic Papers, 53, 3, pp. 434-452, (2001); Baert S., Cockx B., Verhaest D., Overeducation at the start of the career: Stepping stone or trap?, Labour Economics, 25, pp. 123-140, (2013); Basilio L., Bauer T.K., Kramer A., Transferability of human capital and immigrant assimilation: An analysis for Germany, Labour, 31, 3, pp. 245-264, (2017); Battu H., Sloane P.J., Over-education and ethnic minorities in Britain, The Manchester School, 72, 4, pp. 535-559, (2004); Becker G.S., Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, with Special Reference to Education, (1964); Borjas G.J., The economics of immigration, Journal of Economic Literature, 32, pp. 1667-1717, (1994); Borjas G., Bratsberg B., Who leaves?

Methods: Focus groups were conducted with women of the Turkish and Portuguese communities. Swiss women were included as the reference group. Interpreters were used when needed. Group discussions were recorded and transcribed; all communications were categorized by specific themes and subdivided as to content. Results: Eight focus groups were held: there were a total of 40 participants including 14 Turkish, 17 Portuguese, 9 Swiss. The study revealed that migrant women in Switzerland face stressful situations, which may differ according to nationality and length of stay in the country. Main factors negatively affecting pregnancy were stress due to precarious living conditions, heavy work during pregnancy, inadequate communication with healthcare providers, and feelings of racism and discrimination in society. Conclusions: Main findings of this qualitative study confirm that migrant communities need focused health attention because of numerous barriers to healthcare experienced in Switzerland. Improving the reproductive health of the migrant community is a priority that can be addressed by public health interventions, including integration of migrants into the society, strict observance of labor regulations, improved communication with healthcare providers, and better information targeting migrant communities. © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel 2007.","Migration; Qualitative study; Reproductive health; Switzerland","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; data analysis; delivery; demography; female; health care personnel; health care system; health care utilization; human; information dissemination; information processing; interpersonal communication; labor management; migrant worker; migration; Portugal; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; public health service; qualitative analysis; race difference; racism; reproductive health; social discrimination; stress; Switzerland; Turkey (republic); workload","","","","","Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, (N. 03.001482 /2.24.02 /-232)","We wish to thank the women who took part in the focus groups.

Today’s patterns of migration move on a continuum from long-term and permanent to increasingly temporary and fluid. Based on data from the Migration-Mobility Survey and on theoretical and political considerations, it aims at providing a general empirical overview of the migration flows towards Switzerland. First and on a theoretical level, the two paradigmatic lenses of migration research and mobility studies are presented. Second, the transformation of European migration regimes since the 1970s and its effect on the patterns of migration and mobility are discussed. Third, we show how Switzerland, being part of the European Migration Regime in transformation, can be used as a laboratory to understand the changes in and of an advanced post-industrial society. To this end, we provide a short empirical overview of the immigrant population and their living conditions in the country. Fourth, the chapter provides a set of analytical questions that will be addressed throughout this volume – by means of the Migration-Mobility Survey data – and discussed in the concluding chapter. © The Author(s) 2019.","Migration; Migration-Mobility Nexus; Mobility dynamics; Switzerland","","","","","","","","Castells M., The Rise of the Network Society, 12, (1996); Castles S., Kosack G., Immigrant Workers and Class Structure in Western Europe, (1973); Castles S., de Haas H., Miller M.J., The Age of Migration: International Population Movements in the Modern World, (2013); Cresswell T., On the Move: Mobility in the Modern Western World, (2006); Cresswell T., Merriman P., Geographies of Mobilities: Practices, Spaces, Subjects, (2008); Favell A., Rebooting migration theory: Interdisciplinarity, globality, and postdisciplinarity in migration studies, Migration Theory: Talking across Disciplines, pp. 259-285, (2007); Fibbi R., D'Amato G., Transnationalisme des migrants en Europe: Une preuve par les faits, Revue Européenne Des Migrations Internationales, 24, 2, pp. 7-22, (2008); Fitzgerald D., Scott D., Culling The Masses: The Democratic Origins of Racist Immigration Policy in The Americas, (2014); Hall S., du Gay P., Questions of Cultural Identity, (1996); Harvey D., The Condition of Postmodernity: An Enquiry into the Origins of Cultural Change, (1990); Jacobson D., Rights across Borders: Immigration and the Decline of Citizenship, (1996); Joppke C., Why liberal states accept unwanted immigration, World Politics, 50, 2, pp. 266-293, (1998); Kleger H., Transnationale Staatsbürgerschaft, 38, (1997); Latour B., Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory, (2005); Maurer B., A fish story: Rethinking globalization on Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands, American Ethnologist, 27, 3, pp. 670-701, (2000); Indicators of Immigrant Integration 2015, (2015); Piore M.J., Birds of Passage: Migrant Labor and Industrial Societies, (1979); Poulain M., Perrin N., Singleton A., THESIM: Towards Harmonised European Statistics on International Migration, (2006); Rouse R., Mexican migration and the social space of postmodernism, Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies, 1, 1, pp. 8-23, (1991); Sassen S., The Global City, (1991); Soderstrom O., Randeria S., Ruedin D., D'Amato G., Panese F., Of mobilities and moorings: Critical perspectives, Critical Mobilities, pp. 1-21, (2013); Soysal Y.N., Limits of Citizenship: Migrants and Postnational Membership in Europe, (1994); Stark O., Bloom D.E., The new economics of labor migration, The American Economic Review, 75, 2, pp. 173-178, (1985); Steiner I., Wanner P., Towards a New Dataset for the Analysis of Migration and Integration in Switzerland.

Despite a relatively favourable geographical situation, the prevalence of malnutrition is high in the Sikasso region (Mali). Methods: Survey repeated annually during 5 years, to a sample of 491 families living in Sikasso. The determinants of wasting and stunting were analysed using logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of stunting was about 25%. Prevalence of wasting was about 12%, which is very high, and had been increasing in the past years. No strong associations with socio-economic factors were observed for wasting. Stunting was strongly associated with the education level of both parents, and with the family assets. © 1995 Birkhäuser Verlag.","","Child Nutrition Disorders; Child, Preschool; Demography; Female; Growth Disorders; Human; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mali; Prevalence; Sampling Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Africa; Africa South Of The Sahara; Age Factors; Child; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Diseases; Economic Factors; Educational Status; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Relationships; French Speaking Africa; Mali; Malnutrition; Measurement; Nutrition Disorders; Ownership; Parents; Population; Population Characteristics; Prevalence; Research Methodology; Research Report; Sampling Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Studies; Surveys; Western Africa; Youth; article; female; human; infant; major clinical study; male; mali; malnutrition; newborn; preschool child; prevalence; social status","","","","","","","Pinstrup-Andersen P., Burger S., Habicht J.P., Peterson K., Protein-energy malnutrition, Disease control priorities in developing countries, (1993); Traore B., Konate M., Stanton C., Enquête démographique et de santé au Mali, 1987, (1989); Waterlow J.C., Classification and definition of protein-calorie malnutrition, Br Med J, 3, pp. 566-569, (1972); Use and interpretation of anthropometric indicators of nutritional status, Bull World Health Organ, 64, pp. 929-941, (1986); Clayton D.C., Hills M., Statistical methods in epidemiology, (1993); Victora C.G., The association between wasting and stunting: An international perspective, (1991); Ashworth A., Dowler E., Child malnutrition, Disease and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, (1991); Keller W., Fillmore C.M., Prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition, World Health Stat Q, 36, pp. 129-167, (1983); Soysa P.E., Waterlow J.C., Stunting and the prevalence of malnutrition, Lancet, 1, (1981); Victora C.G., Vaughan J.P., Kirkwood B.R., Martines J.C., Barcelos L.B., Risk factors for malnutrition in Brazilian children: the role of social and environmental variables, Bull World Health Organ, 64, pp. 299-309, (1986); Hobcraft J., McDonald J., Rutstein S.O., Socio-economic factors in infant and child mortality: A cross-national comparison, Population Studies, 38, pp. 193-223, (1984); Richardson S.A., The background histories of school children severely malnourished in infancy, Adv Pediatr, 21, pp. 167-195, (1974); Tomkins A.M., Drasar B.S., Bradley A.K., Williaon W.A., Water supply and nutritional status in rural northern Nigeria, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 72, pp. 239-243, (1978); Gorstein J., Assessment of nutritional status: effects of different methods to determine age on the classification of undernutrition, Bull World Health Organ, 67, pp. 143-150, (1989)","","","Birkhäuser-Verlag","","","","","","1420911X","","SZPMA","7900432","English","Soz Präventivmed","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028932593"

Methods All maternal deaths and live births in Switzerland from 1969 to 2006 from official vital statistics were considered. We calculated maternal mortality ratios (MMRs) in four time intervals (1969-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2006) for both Swiss and immigrant women overall, and for Italian, Spanish and Turkish women. We also computed the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of maternal mortality over the four time periods, considering maternal deaths as cases, and live births as controls. Results From 1969 to 2006 there were 279 maternal deaths, 204 of Swiss women and 75 of immigrant women. Women's age, marital status and cause of death were similar in the two groups. For immigrant women, the crude odds ratio of a pregnancy ending with maternal death, not homogeneous across the four periods, was 4.38 (95% CI 1.88-10.55) in 2000-2006. Conclusions Immigrant women have a higher risk of maternal mortality than Swiss women. A closer scrutiny of risk factors and quality of care is necessary to identify opportunities for prevention. © Swiss School of Public Health 2010.","Immigration; Maternal mortality","Adult; Cause of Death; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Live Birth; Maternal Mortality; Pregnancy; Registries; Switzerland; Young Adult; adult; article; cause of death; ethnology; female; human; live birth; maternal mortality; migration; pregnancy; register; Switzerland","","","","","","","Bischoff A., Hudelson P., Access to healthcare interpreter services: Where are we and where do we need to go, Int J Environ Res Public Health, 7, pp. 2838-2844, (2010); Bollini P., Wanner P., Santé Reproductive des Collectivités Migrantes, (2006); Bollini P., Stotzer U., Wanner P., Pregnancy outcomes and migration: A focus group study, Lnt J Public Health, 52, pp. 78-86, (2007); Bragg R., Maternal deaths and vulnerable migrants, The Lancet, 371, 9616, pp. 879-881, (2008); Calderon M.A.K., Bustamante Montes P., Campuzano Gonzales M., Pliego A.C., Social aspects of maternal mortality: A case study of the State of Mexico, Soc Med, 2, pp. 186-191, (2007); Saving Mothers' Lives: Reviewing Maternal Deaths to Make Motherhood Safer 2003-2005, (2007); Intercooled STATA 9.0, (2005); Degrate A., Testa-Mader A., Clerici N., Mortality in the Swiss and foreign immigrants in the Canton of Ticino, Epidemiol Prev, 23, pp. 84-89, (1999); Delvaux T., Buekens P., Godin I., Boutsen M., The study group on barriers, incentives to prenatal care in Europe (2001) barriers to prenatal care in Europe, Am J Prev Med, 21, pp. 52-59; Deneux-Tharaux C., Philibert M., Bouvier-Colle M., Excess maternal mortality among foreign women in France and quality of obstetric care: A national study 1996-2001.

After three decades of labour migration, in the early 1980s, family reunification progressively became the most important reason for immigration. At the time of the 2000 Census, there were 1.5 million documented foreigners living in Switzerland. This represented 20% of the resident population, one of the highest proportions of foreigners in any country in Europe. Approximately 39% of children in Switzerland were members of families of foreign origin with at least one foreignborn parent. This paper statistically describes the living conditions and socioeconomic environment of those children, by computing indicators according to the origin. It shows the huge diversity of situations regarding the socioeconomic position of parents and the social background. In particular, children from Western Europe and the United States live in highly skilled families whereas children from Portugal and the Balkans live in families with a very low level of qualification. Such results justify the formulation of integration and school policies that take into account the characteristics of each migration flow. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Immigrant families; Integration; Socioeconomic environment; Switzerland","","","","","","","","Efionayi D., Niederberger J.M., Wanner P., Switzerland Faces Common European Challenges.

However, little attention has so far been paid to the juridical status of immigrant groups. This paper explores the variation in education and employment performance of young people from different immigrant origins (Italians, Portuguese, Turks, Croats, Kosovars and Serbs) and of different citizenship statuses - naturalised, non-naturalised, and Swiss-by-birth. Inter-ethnic group variations become much more muted when social origin and length of stay are controlled for; however, they do not disappear altogether.

This performance, however, is overlooked by Swiss society because the acquisition of Swiss citizenship makes it statistically invisible.","Economic integration; Immigration; Naturalisation; School attainment; Second generation; Switzerland","Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland; citizenship; ethnic group; immigrant population; immigration; naturalization; socioeconomic status","","","","","Changing Society; Swiss National Research Fund","The study on which this article is based was financed by a Swiss National Research Fund grant under the Program 52: Childhood, Youth and Intergenerational Relationships in a Changing Society.

The risk has also been measured for each indicator separately, according to the path followed by the individual between 1960 and 1980. The study shows very strong disparities in risk both for men and for women, as well as a moderate reduction in differences in risk by age.

This study examines health disparities between the main immigrant groups in Switzerland and the majority Swiss population. Methods: Epidemiological analysis of the 2002 Swiss Health Survey (SHS): the SHS contains health-related information about 19,706 people who were randomly sampled from among people living in Switzerland. Bi-variate and multivariate analyses of six variables on self-reported health were performed. Findings: The data from the 2002 Swiss Health Survey provide some evidence of health disparities between Swiss people and immigrants. Although the self-reported health of ""Northern immigrants"" (people from Germany and France) does not differ significantly from that of the majority Swiss population, ""Southern immigrants"" (people from Italy, Former Yugoslavia, Portugal, Spain and Turkey) report lower levels of health in several areas. Lower levels of health are particularly likely to be reported by Italian men and women. Conclusion: The self-reported health of immigrants is currently inferior to that of the Swiss. If it is the position of the Swiss health care system to ensure equal health provision for all Swiss residents, including immigrant groups, and to strive for equal health outcomes for all, self-reported ill health among immigrants is a useful basis for health policy and planning. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","Migration; Self-reported health; Switzerland","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Mass Index; Emigrants and Immigrants; Europe; European Continental Ancestry Group; Exercise; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Self Efficacy; Socioeconomic Factors; Switzerland; adolescent; adult; article; bivariate analysis; controlled study; female; France; Germany; health care quality; health care system; health survey; human; immigrant; Italy; male; multivariate analysis; Portugal; priority journal; random sample; self report; Spain; Switzerland; Turkey (republic); Yugoslavia","","","","","","","Rausa F., Schlapfer M., Ausländerinnen und Ausländer in der Schweiz - Bericht 2005, Statistik Der Schweiz, (2005); Loue S., Handbook of Immigrant Health, (1998); Smedley B.D., Stith A.Y., Nelson A.R., Unequal treatment, Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care, (2003); Fiscella K., Et al., Inequality in quality: Addressing socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic disparities in health care, JAMA, 283, pp. 2579-2584, (2000); Weiss R., Eine transdisziplinre Analyäse der Gesundheit von Migrantinnen und Migranten, (2003); Vranjes N., Bisig B., Gutzwiller F., Gesundheit der Ausländer in der Schweiz, (1996); Bischoff A., Loutan L., Burgi D., Migration and Health In Switzerland, (1997); Bouchardy C., Wanner P., Raymond L., La mortalité des étrangers en 1989-92, (2001); Bundesamt für Gesundheit, Bundesamt für Flüchtlinge, Bundesamt für Ausländerfragen und Eidgenössische Ausländerkommission, (2002); Schweizerische Gesundheitsbefragung SGB 2002 - Schlussbericht zur Datenerhebung, (2003); Schweizerische Gesundheitsbefragung: Gesundheit und Gesundheitsverhalten in der Schweiz 1997; Bundesamt für Gesundheit, (2002); Loutan L., Et al., Impact of trauma and torture on asylum seekers, Eur J Public Health, 9, pp. 93-96, (1999); Bischoff A., Wanner P., Gesundheitsmonitoring für MigrantInnen: Sinnvoll?

The comparison of the Swiss and foreign population in terms of reproductive health has received so far insufficient attention. The aim of the present study is to analyze the infant (IMR) and neonatal mortality rates (NMR) of Swiss and foreign children over the last 30years. Methods: Vital statistics from the period 1980 to 2011 were used to compute IMR and NMR according to year and/or citizenship. The main analyses were made contrasting Swiss versus foreigners as a single category, as well as by country of origin. Comparisons between groups were done using relative risks. Results: In 1980-1989, IMR was 14% higher among foreign children as compared to Swiss children, and NMR 28% higher. In 2006-2010, IMR was 18% higher among foreign children than among Swiss children, and NMR 29% higher. The highest gap of IMR was observed during the period 1990-1993 (+21%). Looking at single countries, in 2008-2010 children of migrants from Germany, Portugal, Turkey, Italy, France, Kosovo and Spain had a higher level of IMR as compared to Swiss children. Conclusions: The analysis of vital statistics confirms that over the last 30years the gap of IMR and NMR between Swiss and foreign children has not decreased. Whatever the combination of mechanisms, which cause the observed difference, this fundamental inequity needs to be investigated and remedied by a large scale, concerted effort. © 2017 The Author(s).","Infant Mortality; Migrant health; Reproductive health","Emigrants and Immigrants; Europe; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Kosovo; Male; Switzerland; Turkey; child; citizenship; controlled study; demography; female; France; Germany; human; human experiment; infant; infant mortality; Italy; Kosovo; male; migrant; newborn mortality; Portugal; reproductive health; risk factor; Spain; Swiss; Switzerland; Turkey (republic); vital statistics; epidemiology; ethnology; Europe; infant mortality; migrant; newborn; statistics and numerical data; Switzerland; trends","","","","","Université de Genève, UNIGE","This paper was written using statistical data provided by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office.

""The purpose of this study is to estimate, on the basis of two demographic methods, which ages contributed to the differences in life expectancy by gender during the course of the century. While infant mortality explained the majority of these differences between the genders in 1910/11, this is no longer the case nowadays. Excess male mortality among members of the working-age population, and especially in the older age groups, explains both the differences in average longevity between the sexes and how these differences develop. Seen from another angle, the causes of death which contribute most to these gender disparities, ranked in order of importance, are cancers, violent deaths and ischaemic cardiac disorders.""

Switzerland, marked by its diverse linguistic landscape, reflects cultural variations alongside differences in public health strategies. The goal of this study was to assess potential socioeconomic differences in regional mammography screening programs effectiveness to improve breast cancer screening participation. Methods Data on 14 173 women in the regionally adapted breast cancer screening age range was drawn from five cross-sectional waves of the nationally representative Swiss Health Interview Survey (1997–2017). Socioeconomic indicators included education, household income, and employment status. Poisson regression was used to estimate the adjusted prevalence ratios of up-to-date (last 2 years) mammography uptake. Inequality was assessed using relative index of inequality and the slope index of inequality. Results Organized screening programs were generally effective and increased up-to-date mammography uptake by close to 20 percentage points in both regions. While in the Latin cantons, screening programs had no impact on socioeconomic inequalities in screening, it reduced inequalities for women with lower education in the German cantons. This modification effect of screening programs was not seen for income and employment-related inequalities and did not differ across linguistic regions. Conclusions Public health agencies should consider the different cultural reception of programs as addressing these differences could help ensure that breast cancer screening initiatives are not only effective, but also culturally equitable across different socioeconomic groups.

Methods: Analysis of the mortality rates for cohorts born between 1880 and 1980 in Switzerland. Results: While the mortality transition was a constant feature of the 20th century, mortality receded most sharply among the 1900 to 1940 birth cohorts. Life expectancy gains were much lower for the pre-1900 cohorts, while early trends for the post-1940 cohorts point to a slowdown in the rate of mortality decline. These findings may be connected with the social and health conditions in which the different cohorts lived. Conclusion: In contrast to the cross-sectional analysis, the longitudinal approach shows that the decline in mortality suddenly stops with the 1940 cohort.","Cohort mortality; Disease control; Infant mortality; Life expectancy; Mortality","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Mortality; Risk Factors; Switzerland; adolescent; adult; aged; article; birth; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease control; epidemiological data; female; health status; human; infant; infant mortality; intermethod comparison; life expectancy; longitudinal study; male; mortality; prevalence; sociology; Switzerland","","","","","Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS, (057263)","Cet article a été rédigé dans le cadre d’un subside ATHENA du Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, Berne, subside no 1217–057263.

The long and diverse history of Switzerland as a country of immigration and the availability of rich data on naturalization and international migration that allow individuals to be followed over time make this country a valuable case for investigating the impact of naturalization on international (return or onward) migration. Using longitudinal data, we follow 88,900 immigrants who entered the country between 1998 and 2000 over a period of 84 months between January 2011 and December 2017, documenting changes in naturalization status and in migratory movements and their direction. Using different implementations of a Cox proportional hazards model, we examine whether and under what conditions the international migration behaviour of naturalized persons differs from that of non-naturalized persons. Our results show that the population accessing naturalization tends to be less mobile, but also that among third-country nationals, naturalization can trigger further international mobility, in particular among those with poor economic performance and with no family ties in Switzerland. © 2021, The Author(s).","Dual citizenship; International migration; Naturalization; Subsequent migration; Switzerland","Switzerland; citizenship; immigrant population; international migration; longitudinal gradient; residential mobility; settlement planning","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","Open Access funding provided by Université de Genève.

Methods: Births occurring from 2011 to 2017 were identified in the Swiss population register and merged with the Swiss civil register and the Register of the first pillar to obtain information on the migration origin and socio-economic level. Four indicators of adverse perinatal outcomes were defined. Results: Logistic regressions show that both the migration origin and the socio-economic level are measured by the parents’ income, influence risk. Compared to the children of mothers born in Switzerland, those of mothers from EU/EFTA countries have a lower risk of infant mortality, low birth weight and extreme prematurity. The highest risk is observed for children born to mothers from the rest of the world. High levels of risk consistently characterize children with low-income parents (first decile). Conclusions: Our results justify further investigations at the level of health services to better identify the factors causing differences in the prevalence of adverse outcomes and to take them into account in adapted health policies. © 2020, The Author(s).","Health inequalities; Infant mortality; Low birth weight; Migrants’ children; Preterm birth; Switzerland","Adult; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Extremely Premature; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Socioeconomic Factors; Switzerland; Young Adult; adult; epidemiology; ethnology; female; human; infant; infant mortality; low birth weight; male; migrant; newborn; poverty; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; socioeconomics; statistical model; Switzerland; young adult","","","","","National Center of Competence in Research NCCR; nccr – on the move; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Université de Genève, UNIGE","Open access funding provided by University of Geneva.

The analysis not only considers primary migrants but also accompanying spouses and distinguishes between migrants regarding their country of origin and level of education. Based on the Migration-Mobility Survey data, the author uses not only descriptive statistics but also logistic regressions models to better understand the determinants of integration. Results show that migrants consider themselves relatively well integrated in the labour market: in particular, three-quarters of the men and almost two-thirds of the women declare an improvement in their work conditions compared to the situation before the move, their unemployment rate is low, fewer than 20% of migrants do short-term work or work without a contract, and approximately 60% use their skills at work. However, one can observe differences in the level of integration according to the reason for migration. Not only family migrants but also migrants who arrived in Switzerland for other reasons present a lower probability of job satisfaction and a higher risk of underuse of skills compared with those arriving with a work contract. Results also show a gender gap, men being better integrated than women whatever the indicator that is used. © The Author(s) 2019.","Discrimination; Integration; Labour Force; Migrant Families; Pace of Integration","","","","","","","","Adsera A., Chiswick B.R., Are there gender and country of origin differences in immigrant labor market outcomes across European destinations, Journal of Population Economics, 20, 495, pp. 1432-1475, (2007); Akresh I.R., Occupational mobility among legal immigrants to the United States, International Migration Review, 40, 4, pp. 854-884, (2006); Aydemir A., Immigrant selection and short-term labor market outcomes by visa category, Journal of Population Economics, 24, 2, pp. 451-475, (2011); Bevelander P., Pendakur R., The labour market integration of refugee and family reunion immigrants: A comparison of outcomes in Canada and Sweden, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 40, 5, pp. 689-709, (2014); Blau F.D., Kahn L.M., Moriarty J.Y., Souza A.P., The Role of the Family in immi-grants’ Labor-Market Activity: Evidence from the United States, (2002); Blau F.D., Kahn L.M., Papps K.L., Gender, source country characteristics, and labor market assimilation among immigrants, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 93, 1, pp. 43-58, (2011); Boyle P., Cooke T.J., Halfacree K., Smith D., A cross-national comparison of the impact of family migration on women’s employment status, Demography, 38, 2, pp. 201-213, (2001); The Economic Performance of Immigrants: Immigration Category Perspective (Citi-Zenship and Immigration Canada), (1998); Cooke T.J., All tied up: Tied staying and tied migration within the United States, 1997 to 2007, Demographic Research, 29, pp. 817-836, (2013); Cox D.R., Snell E.J., Analysis of binary data, Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability, 32, (1989); Devoretz D.J., Pivnenko S., Beiser M., The Economic Experiences of Refugees in Canada, (2004); Dustmann C., Fabbri F., Language proficiency and labour market performance of immigrants in the UK, The Economic Journal, 113, 489, pp. 695-717, (2003); Fibbi R., Lerch M., Wanner P., Unemployment and discrimination against youth of immigrant origin in Switzerland: When the name makes the difference, Journal of International Migration and Integration, 7, 3, pp. 351-366, (2006); Harbison S.F., Family structure and family strategy in migration decision making, Migration Decision Making.

However, Switzerland has few preventive strategies against smoking abuse. The aim of this study is to clarify whether educational level and citizenship status have an influence on the prevalence of smoking in Switzerland and whether there is health inequity related to a lack of preventive strategies. Methods: We based our analysis on publicly available health data published in the Swiss government's Swiss health survey (1992–2017). We compared the prevalence of smoking across the years and correlated these data with levels of educational attainment, citizenship status and age. Results: A continuous significant decline in smokers is observed in the highest education group (TERT). Over time, prevalence was reduced from 29% in 1992 to 23% in 2017 (p < 0.001). The intermediate-level educational group (SEK 2) showed smaller but also significant decline on a 0.05 sigificance level over the same period, from 31% to 29% (p = 0.003). The lowest educational group showed a nonsignificant decline from 28% to 27% (p = 0.6). The population who holds Swiss citizenship showed a decrease in smoking from 28% to 26% within the time frame (p < 0.001). People without Swiss citizenship had a much higher prevalence of smokers, at 38% in 1992 and declining to 32% in 2017 (p < 0.001). All cohorts from age 15 to age 64 have a far higher prevalence of smokers than cohorts at an older age, with the highest prevalence in the 25–34 age group. Conclusion: In Switzerland, individuals with lower levels of education and non-Swiss populations are more susceptible to health risk of smoking. This is despite the existence of a high-quality healthcare system that has nevertheless failed to negated health inequities.

These inequalities are often linked either to the socioeconomic structure of different regions' populations, or to specific exposure to the risk of dying (life styles, pollution, etc.). The mobility and characteristics of international migrants can also influence the level of mortality of a region. In this context, this contribution assesses the impact of international migration on spatial inequalities concerning average life expectancy. Using original data based on a population register, this paper analyses the effective contribution of international mobility on life expectancy in urban and non-urban areas of Switzerland. The impact of migration on life expectancy is confirmed, migrant populations contributing to increase life expectancy in swiss urban areas, and particularly in the Geneva lake region. In the urban areas of that region, life expectancy is increased by 1.2 years amongst men and 0.6 years amongst women due to the presence of a selected migrant population. However, the contribution of migration on mortality differences between urban and non-urban areas is weak. The contributing factor is essentially the composition of the population in terms of education. Concerning the disparities observed between different urban areas, these cannot be attributed to the structure of the population. © 2018 Universite des Sciences et Technologiques de Lille.

A wide range of studies have been published on the impact of immigration on the labour market but only few studies take into account both arrivals (immigrations) and departures (emigrations), rather than only the role of newcomers on the labour market. This paper is based on a Swiss Longitudinal Demographic Database which links data from Population and Household Registers, administrative registers, and surveys. In particular, the Swiss Population Register provides the date of arrival or departure of immigrants/emigrants while the Structural Survey provides information on their characteristics and position on the labour market. Based on these data, this paper compares the socioeconomic characteristics of both immigrants and emigrants arrived in Switzerland during the period 2011-2013 or having left the country during the same period, a time span characterized by a yearly net migration of + 80,000 and a rapid economic growth. In terms of level of education, every category is characterized by a positive net immigration, which is not surprising: The economic growth observed in Switzerland during the period led to a demand on the labour market for both skilled and unskilled migrants. More precisely, migratory flows counterbalanced the erosion of the low and averagely skilled working-Age non-migrating population and contributed to approximately one third of the increase in the number of highly skilled workers in the labour market. Concerning the occupations, the impact of the migration balance is highest among managers and sales workers. The paper also demonstrates that the migratory flows contribute to balance the decrease in the low and averagely skilled positions and to partially fulfil the economy's demand for highly skilled workers.

Several epidemiological studies have described the pregnancy outcome of immigrant women in European receiving countries, with conflicting results. The present systematic review makes a quantitative synthesis of available evidence on the association between pregnancy outcomes and integration policies. We reviewed all epidemiological studies comparing the pregnancy outcome of native versus immigrant women in European countries from 1966 to 2004 and retained 65 for analysis, from 12 host countries. Overall, as compared to native women, immigrant women showed a clear disadvantage for all the outcomes considered: 43% higher risk of low birth weight, 24% of pre-term delivery, 50% of perinatal mortality, and 61% of congenital malformations. The risks were clearly and significantly reduced in countries with a strong integration policy. This trend was maintained even after adjustment for age at delivery and parity. On the basis of an analysis of naturalisation rates, five countries in our sample could be categorised as having a strong policies promoting the integration of immigrant communities. The mechanisms through which integration policies may be protective include the increased participation of immigrant communities in the life of the receiving society, and the decreased stress and discrimination they may face. The results of this study highlight a serious problem of equity in perinatal health across European countries. Immigrant women clearly need targeted attention to improve the health of their newborn, but a deep societal change is also necessary to integrate and respect immigrant communities in receiving societies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In turn, migrants’ decisions separate returning home from onward migration to a third country. We find that undereducation is positively associated with the probability of emigration and return to the country of origin. In contrast, the reverse relationship is found between overeducation and emigration, especially among non-European immigrant workers. According to the predictions of the traditional model of migration, based on self-selection, migrants returning home are positively selected relative to migrants emigrating to other countries. We also find that immigrants from a country outside the EU27/EFTA have little incentive to return home and generally accept jobs for which they are mismatched in Switzerland. These results highlight the relevance to understand emigration behaviours in relation to the type of migrant that is most integrated, and productive, in the Swiss market, hence enabling better migration and domestic labour market policy design. © 2021, The Author(s).","Educational mismatch; Emigration; Occupation; Onward migration; Return migration; Wages","Switzerland; education; emigration; migrant worker; occupation; return migration; spatial mismatch; wage","","","","","National Center of Competence in Research nccr; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","Open Access funding provided by Université de Genève.

However, there is no conclusive evidence that inclusive health care policies lead to better outcomes for this group of the population. The aim of this study is to analyse whether there is an association between inclusive health care policies and the mortality patterns of undocumented immigrants, or the distribution of different causes of death among those who have died. Methods: We analyse individual data concerning the deceased in Switzerland between 2011 and 2017. We proceed in two steps. First, we estimate and compare the patterns of mortality of Swiss citizens, documented immigrants, and undocumented immigrants. Second, we test whether there is an association between cantonal authorities’ policies and differing mortality patterns. We use logistic regressions and multinomial regressions to estimate the relationship between legal status and mortality patterns both in Switzerland and across different cantons. Results: We find a difference in the patterns of mortality between undocumented immigrants and the other groups of the population. Specifically, death from circulatory system diseases is twice as frequent among undocumented immigrants compared to documented immigrants and Swiss citizens. However, this difference is smaller in the Swiss cantons that have more inclusive health care policies towards undocumented immigrants. Conclusions: We interpret these results as an indication that policies that expand access to health services lead to better outcomes for undocumented immigrants. This finding has implications for research on civic stratification and public health. Further analysis is needed to evaluate the effects of extending public health care for undocumented immigrants in different contexts. © 2022, The Author(s).","Access to health care; Cause of death; Citizenship; Civic stratification; Irregular immigrants; Migration; Mortality; Undocumented immigrants","Emigrants and Immigrants; Health Policy; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Switzerland; Undocumented Immigrants; epidemiology; health care delivery; health care policy; human; migrant; Switzerland; undocumented immigrant","","","","","Swiss National Fund for Scientific Research, (51NF40–182897)","This study is funded by the Swiss National Fund for Scientific Research (grant 51NF40–182897).

To do so, we compare self-declared remigration intentions with actual departures during the 2 years following a survey. Then, we analyze to what extent the factors associated with both dimensions are similar. The results show that 96% of migrants who wanted to stay in Switzerland actually stayed and that 71% of those who wanted to leave the country actually left. Overall, intentions were a good predictor of behaviors, and the factors associated with remigration intentions and actual behaviors were almost the same. However, intentions reflected migrants’ personal feelings at the time of the survey and sometimes reflected their potential to remain in Switzerland from a legal point of view. Behaviors were more rational than intentions in that migrants’ reflections on their actual situations were more profound, and their choices to stay in Switzerland or to leave were thus influenced by rational elements such as their labor market situations or family constraints. © 2020, The Author(s).","Migration behaviors; Migration intentions; Remigration; Switzerland","Switzerland; emigration; human behavior; immigrant population; international migration; prediction; survey","","","","","National Center of Competence in Research nccr; nccr – on the move; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","Open Access funding provided by University of Geneva.

Methods: We conducted a survey available in 8 languages among 2,354 members of the target population in Switzerland in 2020. We measured health literacy in four dimensions (finding, understanding, evaluating and applying health information) and assessed adherence to official recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Most migrants felt well informed about the pandemic. Using an extended index of health literacy, we found a moderate correlation (r = −0.28 [−0.24, −0.32]) between COVID-19-related health literacy and socioeconomic vulnerability. The most socioeconomically vulnerable migrants tended to have more difficulty finding and understanding health information about COVID-19 and adhered more to unscientific theses that were not part of the official communication. Conclusion: Special communication efforts by public health authorities have reached most migrants, but socioeconomic vulnerability can be a barrier to taking precautions.

Reducing these adverse birth outcomes is a global public health priority and requires strategies to improve health care during pregnancy. We aimed to assess the effect of a Swiss health policy expansion fully covering illness-related costs during pregnancy on health outcomes in newborn babies. Methods: We implemented a quasi-experimental difference in regression discontinuity design to assess the effect of expansion of Swiss health insurance (on March 1, 2014), to fully cover health-care costs during pregnancy and 8 weeks postpartum, on neonatal outcomes. Before this reform, only costs specific to the standard monitoring of a normal pregnancy were covered. Babies born before March 1, 2014, and their mothers were assigned to the unexposed group, and babies born on or after March 1, 2014, and their mothers were assigned to the exposed group. We included nearly all children born 2011–19 in Switzerland within a period of 9 months around the date March 1, 2014, and control years 2012, 2016, and 2018. Outcomes were birthweight, low birthweight, very low birthweight, gestational age, preterm or extremely preterm birth, and neonatal death. We estimated the intention-to-treat effect of the policy using parametric regression models. Findings: 61 910 children were born 9 months before and 63 991 were born 9 months after March 1, 2014. 382 861 children were born in the same time period around the three control dates. In the period before policy implementation, mean birthweight was 3289 g, gestational age was 275 days, and 6·5% of children had low birthweight, 1·0% very low birthweight, 7·1% were preterm, 0·4% were extremely preterm, and 0·3% died within the first 28 days of life. After initiation of the policy (vs before) mean birthweight increased by 23 g (95% CI 5 to 40) and the predicted proportion of low birthweight births decreased by 0·81% (0·14 to 1·48) and of very low birthweight births decreased by 0·41% (0·17 to 0·65). The effect on very low birthweight was not robust in sensitivity analyses. The policy had a negligible effect on gestational age (mean difference 1 day, 95% CI 0 to 1) and no clear effects on the other examined outcomes. The change in predicted proportion for preterm births was –0·39% (95% CI –1·2 to 0·38), for extremely preterm births was –0·09% (–0·27 to 0·08), and for neonatal death was –0·07% (–0·2 to 0·07). Interpretation: Free access to prenatal care in Switzerland reduced the risk of some adverse health outcomes in newborn babies. Expanding health-care coverage is a relevant health system intervention to reduce the risk of adverse health outcomes in the newborn baby and, potentially, across the life course.

The purpose of our study was to measure and describe the respective contributions of the various age groups and causes of death to the difference in life expectancy at birth between men and women. Methods: With an analytical demographic method this difference in life expectancy can be distributed according to age and cause of death. The contribution of each age and cause can be discussed. Results: All ages and quite all causes of death contribute to overmortality in men. Age groups over 50, as well as circulatory diseases and malignant neoplams, contribute most to gender disparities in longevity while violent deaths play a less important role. Conclusions: Any attempt to reduce gender mortality disparities would involve the modification of a number of etiological factors, including biological factors or those linked to lifestyle.","Cause of death; Differential mortality; Life expectancy; Sex factors; Switzerland","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Population Surveillance; Sex Characteristics; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors; Switzerland; adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; child; demography; female; human; infant; life expectancy; longevity; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplastic disease; mortality; sex difference; Switzerland; violence; age distribution; cause of death; health survey; life expectancy; lifestyle; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; sex ratio; sexual development; Switzerland","","","","","","","Tables de Mortalité Pour la Suisse 1988/1993, (1996); Vers l'Égalité ?
