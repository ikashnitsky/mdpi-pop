In this article we ask how the schooling levels of husband and wife come to be associated with each other through the marriage market. The Kiefer-Neumann model of labor market search is adapted to marital search, the aim being to explain both the positive sorting on education levels for spouses, and the positive relationship between female schooling and age at first marriage.

The urgency of doing so is heightened by emerging evidence of urban fertility stalls and reversals in some sub-Saharan African contexts as well as the significance of natural increase over migration in driving rapid urban growth. Moreover, there is new evidence from evaluations of large programmatic interventions focused on urban family planning that suggest ways to inform future programmes and policies that are adapted to local contexts. We present the key dimensions and challenges of urban growth in LMICs, offer a critical scoping review of recent research findings on urban family planning and fertility dynamics, and highlight priorities for future research.

Yet, there is no well-established, consistent way to measure either urban land or people. Even census-based urban concepts and measures undergo frequent revision, impeding rigorous comparisons over time and place. This study presents a new spatial approach to derive consistent urban proxies for the US. It compares census-designated urban blocks with proxies for land-based classifications of built-up areas derived from time-series of the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) for 1990–2010. This comparison provides a new way to understand urban structure and its changes: Most land that is more than 50% built-up, and people living on such land, are officially classified as urban. However, 30% of the census-designated urban population and land is located in less built-up areas that can be characterized as mainly suburban and peri-urban in nature. Such insights are important starting points for a new urban research program: creating globally and temporally consistent proxies to guide modelling of urban change. © 2018 Balk et al.

Annual data on some 361 areal units are available, these support the estimation of dynamic fixed-effect models of marital fertility. The statistical models take aim at the principal empirical prediction of diffusion hypotheses: the implication of autoregressive behaviour in fertility. We test for autoregressive effects over time within areas, and also for spatial effects whereby fertility control in one geographical area has a spillover influence on another. The Taiwanese data produce clear evidence in support of within-area diffusion. The evidence for cross-area diffusion is much weaker; there is surprisingly little suggestion of city-to-country diffusion. The estimates imply that interpersonal diffusion amplified the impact of Taiwan’s family planning programme on fertility. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","China; Contraception; Demography; Family Planning; History of Medicine, Modern; Statistics; Taiwan; autoregressive behaviour; developing country; fertility control diffusion; fertility transition; interpersonal diffusion; modelling approach; population fertility; statistical model; article; China; contraception; demography; family planning; history; history of medicine","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01-26706)","* We would like to thank Xiangyu Ye for his assistance in every aspect of this research.

The type of risk varies by location, with the lives, homes, and livelihoods of residents of India’s coastal megacities threatened by coastal floods and storm surges while village-dwellers residing in rural flood plains may additionally lose both crops and livestock. Schools and health facilities throughout the country are also at risk. This multi-scale study employs several datasets, from multiple domains, to generate high-resolution estimates of potential exposure to fluvial and coastal floods for (1) urban and rural populations, (2) health facilities, and (3) educational facilities. Our results, presented at the state level, suggest high exposure to fluvial flooding with about 184 million or more than 1:7 of India’s population at risk. This proportion is somewhat higher for rural dwellers (15.8%) compared with urban residents (14.2%). Urban residents, however, are much more likely to be affected by coastal floods, likely due to the high population densities of India’s coastal megacities. In total, around 19,218 (15%) of health and 34,519 (18%) of educational facilities are exposed to either coastal or fluvial flood risks. A spatially detailed, locally refined, comprehensive flood risk assessment such as this is critical to inform and target public policy and guide disaster risk reduction plans. By improving infrastructure, increasing awareness, and developing proactive, targeted, and inclusive flood plans, communities can build resilience. © 2023 The Author(s).

The chapter focuses its discussion primarily on the developed countries, principally the United States, but refers to developing country issues where these are applicable. The role of economic variables as determinants of demographic behavior is often far more vivid and persuasive in developing nations than it is in the United States or Western Europe. The chapter presents a review for the United States of trends in those demographic variables that are strongly associated with female labor supply: age at first marriage, marital dissolution, age at first birth, the number of children born over the life cycle, and the age pattern of fertility. Demographers have uncovered pronounced empirical regularities in these variables, at least in aggregate data; in some instances the patterns are regular enough to be summarized in parsimonious model schedules. These schedules are reviewed in the chapter. The chapter discusses that economists have left such regularities largely unexploited; the prior information embedded in model schedules may yield efficiency gains in estimation, especially where aggregate data are concerned. The chapter concludes with a review of the recent efforts to establish regularities in micro data. © 1986, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

If the general trend is unmistakable, efforts to measure it precisely have been beset with difficulties: The criteria defining urban areas, cities and towns differ from one country to the next and can also change over time for any given country. The past decade has seen great progress toward the long-awaited goal of scientifically comparable urbanization measures, thanks to the combined efforts of multiple disciplines. These efforts have been organized around what is termed the “statistical urbanization” concept, whereby urban areas are defined by population density, contiguity and total population size. Data derived from remote-sensing methods can now supply a variety of spatial proxies for urban areas defined in this way. However, it remains to be understood how such proxies complement, or depart from, meaningful country-specific alternatives. In this paper, we investigate finely resolved population census and satellite-derived data for the United States, Mexico and India, three countries with widely varying conceptions of urban places and long histories of debate and refinement of their national criteria. At the extremes of the urban-rural continuum, we find evidence of generally good agreement between the national and remote sensing-derived measures (albeit with variation by country), but identify significant disagreements in the middle ranges where today’s urban policies are often focused. © 2021 by the author.","Built environment; Demographics; Economic geography; Remote sensing; Rural-urban continuum; Spatial; Spatial demography; Urban economics; Urbanness","Population dynamics; Remote sensing; Rural areas; Built environment; Cities and towns; Economic geography; Remote-sensing; Rural-urban continuum; Spatial; Spatial demography; Urban areas; Urban economic; Urbanness; Population statistics","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1924670, R03 HD096193-02); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P2CHD066613, R21 HD098717 01A1); Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, SBE, (1416860); Carnegie Corporation of New York, CCNY; National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCAR; Population Council; City University of New York, CUNY; University of Colorado Boulder, (-F-16-53680); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; European Commission, EC, (2018.CE.16.BAT.050)","Funding: The work was funded, in large part, by the US National Science Foundation award #1416860 to the City University of New York, the Population Council, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Biomarkers for sexually transmitted infection (STI) were used to validate self-reported behavior by interview mode. As part of a parent study evaluating home versus clinic screening and diagnosis for STIs, 818 women aged 18-40 years were recruited in 2004 at or near a primary care clinic in São Paulo, Brazil, and were randomized to a face-to-face interview or audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Ninety-six percent of participants were tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. Reporting of STI risk behavior was consistently higher with the computerized mode of interview. Stronger associations between risk behaviors and STI were found with the computerized interview after controlling for sociodemographic factors. These results were obtained by using logistic regression approaches, as well as statistical methods that address potential residual confounding and covariate endogeneity. Furthermore, STI-positive participants were more likely than STI-negative participants to underreport risk behavior in the face-to-face interview. Results strongly suggest that computerized interviewing provides more accurate and reliable behavioral data. The analyses also confirm the benefits of using data on prevalent STIs for externally validating behavioral reporting. © The Author 2008.

They bring behavioural content to the mathematically elegant Markov models of family building. They meet the criterion that Bulatao (1989) advances that method use, discontinuation and switching be considered not in isolation, but with reference to individual reproductive goals. Dynamic models help to link the literature on method choice with the literature on method effectiveness. These theoretical advantages are, at present, counter-balanced by empirical limitations. This article explores the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of dynamic contraceptive choice models. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

To engage effectively with the emerging trends, countries and agencies will need to base their decisions on demographic estimates that are scientifically sound. To plan for future growth, they will require informative forecasts of city size that are free from systematic bias. Unfortunately, demographic researchers are not yet in a position to deliver these scientific inputs. In this chapter, we consider the current state of urban demographic research and argue that as the developing world continues to urbanize, and both local and national planners struggle to anticipate and adapt to city growth, they will increasingly need to draw upon spatially disaggregated demographic data. Although the urban transition has been in the making for decades, demographers are only belatedly coming to understand how much remains to be done to construct the kind of research infrastructure that will provide policymakers with scientific guidance (Panel on Urban Population Dynamics 2003; Bocquier 2005). As explained in the chapter's second and third sections, with the increasing availability of urban demographic and boundary data for small geographic units - including districts within cities - there are now good prospects for bringing spatial content to demographic research. The combination of spatial and population data will help to resolve some of the measurement issues that have long bedeviled demographers and will likely inject new energy into the field of city population estimation and forecasting.

We conducted the first global survey of the large cities' water sources, and show that previous global hydrologic models that ignored urban water infrastructure significantly overestimated urban water stress. Large cities obtain 78±3% of their water from surface sources, some of which are far away: cumulatively, large cities moved 504 billion liters a day (184km3yr-1) a distance of 27,000±3800km, and the upstream contributing area of urban water sources is 41% of the global land surface. Despite this infrastructure, one in four cities, containing $4.8±0.7 trillion in economic activity, remain water stressed due to geographical and financial limitations. The strategic management of these cities' water sources is therefore important for the future of the global economy. © 2014 The Authors.","Cities; Cross-basin transfer; Desalination; Groundwater; Surface water; Water security","desalination; global economy; hydrological modeling; land surface; surface water; urban growth; water stress","","","","","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, GBMF","A grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation funded the development of the City Water Map.

In turn, the greater availability of spatially referenced epidemiological data is driving the rapid expansion of disease mapping and spatial modeling methods, which are becoming increasingly detailed and sophisticated, with rigorous handling of uncertainties. This expansion has, however, not been matched by advancements in the development of spatial datasets of human population distribution that accompany disease maps or spatial models.Where risks are heterogeneous across population groups or space or dependent on transmission between individuals, spatial data on human population distributions and demographic structures are required to estimate infectious disease risks, burdens, and dynamics. The disease impact in terms of morbidity, mortality, and speed of spread varies substantially with demographic profiles, so that identifying the most exposed or affected populations becomes a key aspect of planning and targeting interventions. Subnational breakdowns of population counts by age and sex are routinely collected during national censuses and maintained in finer detail within microcensus data. Moreover, demographic and health surveys continue to collect representative and contemporary samples from clusters of communities in low-income countries where census data may be less detailed and not collected regularly. Together, these freely available datasets form a rich resource for quantifying and understanding the spatial variations in the sizes and distributions of those most at risk of disease in low income regions, yet at present, they remain unconnected data scattered across national statistical offices and websites.In this paper we discuss the deficiencies of existing spatial population datasets and their limitations on epidemiological analyses. We review sources of detailed, contemporary, freely available and relevant spatial demographic data focusing on low income regions where such data are often sparse and highlight the value of incorporating these through a set of examples of their application in disease studies. Moreover, the importance of acknowledging, measuring, and accounting for uncertainty in spatial demographic datasets is outlined. Finally, a strategy for building an open-access database of spatial demographic data that is tailored to epidemiological applications is put forward. © 2012 Tatem et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Demography; Disease mapping; Epidemiology; Population","data set; demography; disease control; ecological modeling; epidemiology; GIS; GPS; health risk; health survey; infectious disease; mapping method; morbidity; mortality; numerical model; population structure; risk factor; spatial analysis; spatial variation; survey; concept mapping; data base; demography; health survey; human; infection; lowest income group; malaria; metric system; morbidity; mortality; Plasmodium falciparum; population; priority journal; review; risk; sex; statistics","","","","","Applications Center; Fondation Philippe Wiener; SEDAC; US Agency for International Development-funded MEASURE Demographic and Health Survey; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Fogarty International Center, FIC; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD047879); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (NNG08HZ11C); U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DHS; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (49446); Science and Technology Directorate, S&T; Wellcome Trust, WT, (095127)","AJT is supported by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (#49446), which also supports DP.

Composed of leading experts in population health measurement from a variety of disciplines, sectors, and continents, RULER met for the purpose of reviewing existing methods of measurement for urban health in the context of recent reports from UN agencies on health inequities in urban settings. The audience for this report was identified as international, national, and local governing bodies; civil society; and donor agencies. The goal of the report was to identify gaps in measurement that must be filled in order to assess and evaluate population health in urban settings, especially in informal settlements (or slums) in low- and middle-income countries. Care must be taken to integrate recommendations with existing platforms (e.g., Health Metrics Network, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation) that could incorporate, mature, and sustain efforts to address these gaps and promote effective data for healthy urban management. RULER noted that these existing platforms focus primarily on health outcomes and systems, mainly at the national level. Although substantial reviews of health outcomes and health service measures had been conducted elsewhere, such reviews covered these in an aggregate and perhaps misleading way. For example, some spatial aspects of health inequities, such as those pointed to in the 2008 report from the WHO's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, received limited attention. If RULER were to focus on health inequities in the urban environment, access to disaggregated data was a priority. RULER observed that some urban health metrics were already available, if not always appreciated and utilized in ongoing efforts (e.g., census data with granular data on households, water, and sanitation but with little attention paid to the spatial dimensions of these data). Other less obvious elements had not exploited the gains realized in spatial measurement technology and techniques (e.g., defining geographic and social urban informal settlement boundaries, classification of population-based amenities and hazards, and innovative spatial measurement of local governance for health). In summary, the RULER team identified three major areas for enhancing measurement to motivate action for urban health - namely, disaggregation of geographic areas for intra-urban risk assessment and action, measures for both social environment and governance, and measures for a better understanding of the implications of the physical (e.g., climate) and built environment for health. The challenge of addressing these elements in resource-poor settings was acknowledged, as was the intensely political nature of urban health metrics. The RULER team went further to identify existing global health metrics structures that could serve as platforms for more granular metrics specific for urban settings. © 2011 The New York Academy of Medicine.","","Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Group Processes; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Population Surveillance; Research; Urban Health; Urban Population; article; developed country; developing country; group process; health; health disparity; health survey; human; methodology; research; urban population","","","","","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF","With support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the IHME has projects on health metrics that include Burden of Disease, Malaria, Disease Control, and the “Population Health Metrics Research Consortium Project.” The latter is a multi-institutional project whose goal is to improve strategies for population health measurement and produce instruments that are science-based, standardized, and widely applicable across different resource-poor settings; to provide data and resources that will be the basis for rapid and effective field assessment of population prevalence of specific diseases and causes of death; and to enable policymakers and researchers to address persistent inequities in health outcomes in both the developed and the developing world. Activities include developing methods to measure mortality where vital registration methods are incomplete, to measure cause-specific mortality where cause of death coding is incomplete, to measure prevalence and incidence of major diseases, and to measure effective delivery of priority health interventions.","Leviton L.C., Snell E., McGinnis M., Urban issues in health promotion strategies, American Journal of Public Health, 90, 6, pp. 863-866, (2000); Population and Health Dynamics in Nairobi's Informal Settlements: Report of the Nairobi Cross-sectional Slums Survey (NCSS) 2000, (2002); Geronimus A.T., To mitigate, resist, or undo: Addressing structural influences on the health of urban populations, American Journal of Public Health, 90, 6, pp. 867-872, (2000); McCord C., Freeman H.P., Excess moralityin harlem, N Engl J Med., 322, 3, pp. 173-177, (1990); MacIntyre S., McKay L., Ellaway A., Are rich people or poor people more likely to be ill?

Several maximum likelihood models are estimated to assess the severity of selection bias. A child’s health enters the models as an unobserved variable within the framework developed by Heckman and Singer. Birth weight is treated as an indicator for unmeasured variables; that is, the “mixing distribution” for the unobservables shifts with the level of birth weight. Results indicate that the direct influence of breast-feeding on survival remains of overwhelming importance even after corrections for selection bias are made. © 1976 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Mixing distributions;

Zipf's Law states that the exponent of the power law for rank-size distributions of cities is near ?1. Verification of power law scaling for city size distributions at continental and global scales is complicated by small sample sizes, inappropriate estimation techniques, inconsistent definitions of urban extent and variations in the accuracy and spatial resolution of census administrative units. We attempt to circumvent some of these complications by using a continuous spatial proxy for anthropogenic development and treat it as a spatial complement to population distribution. We quantify the linearity and exponent of the rank-size distribution of spatially contiguous patches of stable night light over a range of brightnesses corresponding to different intensities of development. Temporally stable night lights, as measured by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS), provide a unique proxy for anthropogenic development. Brightness and spatial extent of emitted light are correlated to population density (Sutton et al., 2001), built area density (Elvidge et al., 2007c) and economic activity (Doll et al., 2006; Henderson et al., 2009) at global scales and within specific countries. Using a variable brightness threshold to derive spatial extent of developed land area eliminates the complication of administrative definitions of urban extent and makes it possible to test Zipf's Law in the spatial dimension for a wide range of anthropogenic development. Higher brightness thresholds generally correspond to more intense development while lower thresholds extend the lighted area to include smaller settlements and less intensively developed peri-urban and agricultural areas. Using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate power law linearity and exponent of the resulting rank-size distributions across a range of upper tail cutoffs, we consistently find statistically significant exponents in the range ?0.95 to ?1.11 with an abrupt transition to very large, extensively connected, spatial networks of development near the low light detection limit of the sensor. This range of exponents and transition are observed at both continental and global scales. The results suggest that Zipf's Law also holds for spatial extent of anthropogenic development across a range of intensities at both continental and global scales. The implication is that the dynamics of urban growth and development may be represented as spatial phase transitions when the spatial extent and intensity of development are treated as continuous variables rather than discrete entities. © 2010.","Land cover; Landsat; Night light; Power law; Scaling; Urban; Zipf","Computational linguistics; Economics; Estimation; Landforms; Phase transitions; Population statistics; Security of data; Size determination; Size distribution; Land cover; LANDSAT; Night lights; Power law; Scaling; Urban; Zipf; accuracy assessment; census; economic activity; global perspective; human development index; land cover; Landsat; maximum likelihood analysis; population density; population distribution; power law; remote sensing; sensor; size distribution; spatial analysis; spatial resolution; urban development; urban growth; Maximum likelihood estimation","","","","","NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center; Population Council and Columbia University; United States National Institutes of Child Health and Development, (R21 HD054846); City University of New York; Doherty Foundation","This work was funded, in part, by the United States National Institutes of Child Health and Development award R21 HD054846 to the City University of New York, the Population Council and Columbia University.

Yet few studies of developing-country cities have explored these issues. We investigated whether the health of urban women and children in poor countries is influenced by both household and neighborhood standards of living. Using data from the urban samples of 85 Demographic and Health Surveys and modeling living standards using factor-analytic MIMIC methods, we found that the neighborhoods of relatively poor households are more heterogeneous than is often asserted. Our results indicated that poor urban households do not tend to live in uniformly poor neighborhoods: about 1 in 10 of a poor household's neighbors is relatively affluent, belonging to the upper quartile of the urban distribution of living standards. Do household and neighborhood living standards influence health? Using multivariate models, we found that household living standards are closely associated with three health measures: unmet need for modern contraception, attendance of a trained health care provider at childbirth, and young children's height for age. Neighborhood living standards exert a significant additional influence in many of the surveys we examined, especially for birth attendance.","","","","","","","","","Aber J.L., Gephart M.A., Brooks-Gunn J., Connell J.P., Development in Context: Implications for Studying Neighborhood Effects., Neighborhood Poverty, Context and Consequences for Children, 1, pp. 44-61, (1997); Aberg Yngwe M., Fritzell J., Lundberg O., Diderichsen F., Burstrom B., Exploring Relative Deprivation: Is Social Comparison a Mechanism in the Relation Between Income and Health?, Social Science and Medicine, 57, pp. 1463-1473, (2003); Population and Health Dynamics in Nairobi's Informal Settlements: Report of the Nairobi Cross-Sectional Slums Survey (NCSS) 2000, (2002); Astone N., Nathanson C.A., Schoen R.R., Kim Y.J., Family Demography, Social Theory, and Investment in Social Capital, Population and Development Review, 25, pp. 1-31, (1999); Baker J.L., Social Exclusion in Urban Uruguay, (2001); Behrman J., Kohler H.-P., Watkins S., Social Networks, Family Planning, and Worrying About AIDS, (2001); Bollen K., Structural Equations With Latent Variables, (1989); Caldeira T.P.R., Fortified Enclaves: The New Urban Segregation, Cities and Citizenship, pp. 114-138, (1999); Caldeira T.P.R., City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in São Paulo, (2000); Casterline J.B., Diffusion Processes and Fertility Transition: Selected Perspectives, (2001); Casterline J.B., Montgomery M.R., Agyeman D.K., Aglobitse P., Kiros G.-E., Social Networks and Contraceptive Dynamics in Southern Ghana, (2001); Casterline J.B., Sinding S.W., Unmet Need for Family Planning in Developing Countries and Implications for Population Policy, Population and Development Review, 26, pp. 691-723, (2000); Coleman J.S., Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital, American Journal of Sociology, 94, SUPPL., (1988); Coulton C., Korbin J., Chan T., Su M., Mapping Residents' Perceptions of Neighborhood Boundaries: A Methodological Note, (1997); Drukker M., Kaplan C., Feron F., van Os J., Children's Health-Related Quality of Life, Neighbourhood Socio-economic Deprivation and Social Capital.

We compare and combine data series of officially-designated urban areas, 1990–2010, at the census block-level within Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with a satellite-derived consistent series on built-up area from the Global Human Settlement Layer to create urban classes that characterize urban structure and provide estimates of land and population. We find considerable heterogeneity in urban form across MSAs, even among those of similar population size, indicating the inherent difficulties in urban definitions. Over time, we observe slightly declining population densities and increasing land and population in areas captured only by census definitions or low built-up densities, constrained by the geography of place. Nevertheless, deriving urban proxies from satellite-derived built-up areas is promising for future efforts to create spatio-temporally consistent measures for urban land to guide urban demographic change analysis. © 2019, The Author(s).","","article; controlled study; geography; human; population size; United States; urban area","","","","","US National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (-F-16-53680, 1314040, 1416860, CHE-1314040); National Science Foundation, NSF; Carnegie Corporation of New York, CCNY, (G-F-16-53680); Carnegie Corporation of New York, CCNY; National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCAR; Population Council; City University of New York, CUNY; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado, CU","The work was funded by the US National Science Foundation award #1416860 to the City University of New York, the Population Council, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the University of Colorado at Boulder, and with additional support from NSF award # CHE-1314040 to Bryan Jones at the City University of New York, an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship award #G-F-16-53680 from the Carnegie Corporation of New York to Deborah Balk, an Innovative Seed Grant from the University of Colorado and a development grant received from University of Colorado Population Center (CUPC) at the Institute of Behavioral Science to Stefan Leyk.

It has long been known that India’s official estimates of urban percentages conflict with estimates derived from alternative conceptions of urbanization. To date, however, the detailed spatial and settlement boundary data needed to analyze and reconcile these differences have not been available. This paper presents gridded estimates of population at a resolution of 1 km along with two spatial renderings of urban areas—one based on the official tabulations of population and settlement types (i.e., statutory towns, outgrowths, and census towns) and the other on remotely-sensed measures of built-up land derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. We also cross-classified the census data and the remotely-sensed data to construct a hybrid representation of the continuum of urban settlement. In their spatial detail, these materials go well beyond what has previously been available in the public domain, and thereby provide an empirical basis for comparison among competing conceptual models of urbanization. © 2019 by the authors.

Understanding demographic trends in the cities of the developing world is critical to those countries - their societies, economies, and environments. The benefits from urbanization cannot be overlooked, but the speed and sheer scale of this transformation presents many challenges. In this uniquely thorough and authoritative volume, 16 of the world“s leading scholars on urban population and development have worked together to produce the most comprehensive and detailed analysis of the changes taking place in cities and their implications and impacts. They focus on population dynamics, social and economic differentiation, fertility and reproductive health, mortality and morbidity, labor force, and urban governance. As many national governments decentralize and devolve their functions, the nature of urban management and governance is undergoing fundamental transformation, with programs in poverty alleviation, health, education, and public services increasingly being deposited in the hands of untested municipal and regional governments. Cities Transformed identifies a new class of policy maker emerging to take up the growing responsibilities. Drawing from a wide variety of data sources, many of them previously inaccessible, this essential text will become the benchmark for all involved in city-level research, policy, planning, and investment decisions.

If managed intelligently and humanely, this growth can pave the way to sustainable development; otherwise, it will favour higher levels of poverty and environmental stress. The outcome depends on decisions being made now. The principal theme that runs through this volume is the need to transform urbanization into a positive force for development. Part I of this book reviews the demography of the urban transition, stressing the importance of benefi cial rural-urban connections and challenging commonly held misconceptions. Part II asks how urban housing, land and service provision can be improved in the face of rapid urban expansion, drawing lessons from experiences around the world. Part III analyses the challenges and opportunities that urbanization presents for improving living environments and reducing pressures on local and global ecosystems. These social and environmental challenges must be met in the context of fast-changing demographic circumstances; Part IV explores the range of opportunities that these transformations represent. These challenges and opportunities vary greatly across Africa, Asia and Latin America, as detailed in Part V. Published with IIED and UNFPA. © IIED and UNFPA, 2008.

In this paper the authors consider individual-level data on courtships in Thailand, and develop a statistical model of the courtship rate, using data drawn from the Thailand Asian Marriage Survey of 1978-9. A proportional-hazards model of women’s age at first marriage is also estimated. The first-marriage hazard function can be partitioned into the courtship rate and the probability that a given courtship will lead to marriage. The authors show how the rate of courtship contributes to an understanding of the age-pattern in the first-marriage hazard function.* © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Thailand; courtship; first marriage hazard function; marriage opportunity","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R0I HD 22188-01)","* The authors are, respectively, Assistant Professor of Economics, Officeo f Population Research, Princeton University; Director, Population Planning Unit, Ministry of Health, Singapore; and graduate student in sociology, Office of Population Research.

The aim is to identify key linkages between demographic change and urban health – subjects of two largely disparate fields of research and practice – with a view to informing arguments and advocacy for urban health while identifying research gaps and priorities. The core arguments are threefold. First, urban health advocates should express a globalized perspective on demographic processes, encompassing age-structural shifts in addition to population growth and decrease, and acknowledging their uneven spatial distributions within and between urban settings in different contexts. Second, advocates should recognize the dynamic and transformational effects that demographic forces will exert on economic and political systems in all urban settings. While demographic forces underpin the production of (intra)urban inequities in health, they also present opportunities to address those inequities. Third, a demographic perspective may help to extend urban health thinking and intervention beyond a biomedical model of disease, highlighting the need for a multi-generational view of the changing societal bases for urban health, and enjoining significant advances in how interested parties collect, manage, analyse, and use demographic data. Accordingly, opportunities are identified to increase the availability of granular and accurate data to enable evidence-informed action on the demographic/health nexus.

We ask what hypotheses can be tested using proxies, and compare these indicators with consumption expenditures per adult, our preferred measure of living standards. We find that the proxies employed in much demographic research are very weak predictors of consumption per adult. Nevertheless, hypothesis tests based on proxies are likely to be powerful enough to warrant consideration.","","Adult; Child; Demography; Developing Countries; Educational Status; Female; Fertility; Humans;

While cities struggle to provide water to these new residents, they will also face equally unprecedented hydrologic changes due to global climate change. Here we use a detailed hydrologic model, demographic projections, and climate change scenarios to estimate per-capita water availability for major cities in the developing world, where urban growth is the fastest. We estimate the amount of water physically available near cities and do not account for problems with adequate water delivery or quality. Modeled results show that currently 150 million people live in cities with perennial water shortage, defined as having less than 100 L per person per day of sustainable surface and groundwater flow within their urban extent. By 2050, demographic growth will increase this figure to almost 1 billion people. Climate change will cause water shortage for an additional 100 million urbanites. Freshwater ecosystems in river basins with large populations of urbanites with insufficient water will likely experience flows insufficient to maintain ecological process. Freshwater fish populations will likely be impacted, an issue of special importance in regions such as India's Western Ghats, where there is both rapid urbanization and high levels of fish endemism. Cities in certain regions will struggle to find enough water for the needs of their residents and will need significant investment if they are to secure adequate water supplies and safeguard functioning freshwater ecosystems for future generations.","General circulation model; Global Rural-Urban Mapping Program; Global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change","fresh water; ground water; city; climate change; conference paper; demography; developing country; freshwater availability; freshwater environment; freshwater fish; human; hydrology; India; nonhuman; priority journal; resident; river basin; species endemicity; surface property; urban area; urban population; urbanization; water availability; water flow; water quality; water supply","","","","","","","World Urbanization Prospects: The 2007 Revision, (2007); Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, (2007); McDonald R.I., Et al., Implications of fast urban growth for freshwater provision, Ambio; Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP): Urban Extents, (2004); Balk D., Et al., Population Dynamics and Climate Change, pp. 80-103, (2009); Vorosmarty C.J., Fekete B., Meybeck M., Lammers R.B., Global systems of rivers: Its role in organizing continental land mass and defining land-to-ocean linkages, Global Biogeochem Cycles, 14, pp. 599-621, (2000); Vorosmarty C.J., Et al., Continental scale models of water balance and fluvial transport: An application to South America, Global Biogeochem Cycles, 3, pp. 241-265, (1989); Vorosmarty C.J., Federer C.A., Schloss A.L., Potential evaporation functions compared on US watersheds: Possible implications for global-scale water balance and terrestrial ecosystem modeling, Journal of Hydrology, 207, 3-4, pp. 147-169, (1998); Wisser D., Et al., Global irrigation water demand: Variability and uncertainties arising from agricultural and climate data sets, Geophys Res Lett, (2008); Wisser D., Et al., The significance of local water resources captured in small reservoirs for crop production: A global-scale analysis, J Hydrol (Amst), 384, pp. 264-275, (2010); Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Scenarios, (2005); Fekete B., Et al., Millennium ecosystem assessment scenario drivers (1970-2050): Climate and hydrological alterations, Global Biogeochem Cycles, 24, (2010); Falkenmark M., Widstrand C., Population and water resources: A delicate balance, Popul Bull, 47, pp. 1-36, (1992); Falkenmark M., Lindh G., How can we cope with the water resources situation by the year 2015?, Ambio, 3, pp. 114-122, (1974); Howard G., Bartram J., Domestic Water Quantity, Service, Level and Health, (2003); Gleick P.H., Basic water requirements for human activities: meeting basic needs, Water International, 21, 2, pp. 83-92, (1996); Beuhler M., Potential impacts of global warming on water resources in southern California, Water Science and Technology, 47, 7-8, pp. 165-168, (2003); Rosenberg N.J., Brown R.A., Izaurralde R.C., Thomson A.M., Integrated assessment of Hadley Centre (HadCM2) climate change projections on agricultural productivity and irrigation water supply in the conterminous United States I.
