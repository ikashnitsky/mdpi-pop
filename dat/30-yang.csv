Using both cohort and period data from the 1994 and 2002 General Social Surveys, this study examines whether there is a reverse trend in staying home among married women with young children under the age of six and those with school-age children aged six to 17. Results of trend analyses by cohort and by period and multinomial logistic regression analysis indicate that there is no reverse trend in staying home among married women with young children as a whole, but the evidence does point to a new trend in staying home among married women with young children and a bachelor's or higher degree. For married women with school-age children as a whole and those with a bachelor's or higher degree, there appears to be mostly statistically insignificant changes in staying home across time periods and among the new generation. The study also finds declines in stay-home rates from 1994 to 2002 especially among less-educated, low-income or African-American married women with young children and to a less extent those with school-age children. The implications of the findings are discussed. © International Sociological Association.","Generation; Married women; Opt-out revolution; Stay-home; Trend","","","","","","","","Mommy Wars: To Work Or Stay at Home?, (2006); Arendell T., Conceiving and Investigating Motherhood: The Decade's Scholarship, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 62, pp. 1192-207, (2000); Belkin L., The Opt-Out Revolution, The New York Times Magazine, 42, (2003); Bowen W.G., Finegan T.A., The Economics of Labor Force Participation, (1969); Brenner M., Not Their Mothers' Choices, Newsweek, 138, 7, pp. 48-9, (2001); Broberg A.G., Hwang C.P., The Shaping of Child-Care Policies, Child Care in Context, (1992); Cain G.G., Married Women in the Labor Force, (1966); More Stay-at-Home Moms, (2003); Staying at Home, (2004); Crittenden A., The Price of Motherhood: Why the Most Important Job in the World is Still the Least Valued, (2001); Desai S., Waite L., Women's Employment during Pregnancy and after the First Birth: Occupational Characteristics and Work Commitment, American Sociological Review, 56, pp. 551-66, (1991); Friedan B., The Second Stage, (1981); Golding C., Understanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women, (1990); Gornick J.C., Meyers M.K., Families That Work: Policies for Reconciling Parenthood and Employment, (2003); Herring C., Wilson-Sadberry K.R., Preference or Necessity?

This paper examines the patterns and determinants of illegal drug use among first and second-generation Asian American youths in Dallas - an area with rapid Asian population growth. Through a targeted survey, we have found a very high rate of cumulative drug use and a significant rate of current drug use. We have also detected some intra-Asian differences in drug abuse among major Asian groups. The results of our statistical analysis identify several possible correlates of current Asian drug abuse, including gender, differential association, parental warning, GPA, type of neighborhood, and high-school quality. © 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The analysis is restricted to legal immigration in numerically limited categories. The results show that the total number of active immigrant visa applicants steadily increased in the aggregate and in each of the preference categories. Moreover, the active demand for immigration was highly skewed, with the majority of applications coming from a dozen countries: Mexico, the Philippines, India, mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Jamaica, Hong Kong, and Pakistan. Most of these highly-backlogged countries displayed a significant increase in the growth rate of demand for immigration. The paper also shows a substantial cross-national variation in the active demand for immigration and explores its structural determinants. The regression results indicate that the level of economic development in sending countries and U.S. economic and cultural relations with sending countries play important roles in the determination process. Policy implications of the findings are also discussed.","","USA; immigration trends; migration flows; population migration","","","","","","","Briggs V.M., Immigration Policy and the American Labor Force, (1984); Briggs V.M., Mass Immigration and the National Interest, (1992); Cheng L., Yang P.Q., Global inequality, global interaction, and professional migration to the United States, 1994 American Sociological Association Annual Meetings, (1994); Fawcett J., Networks, linkages, and migration systems, International Migration Review, 23, pp. 671-680, (1989); Fawcett J.T., Arnold F., Explaining diversity: Asian and Pacific immigration systems, Pacific Bridges: The New Immigration from Asia and the Pacific Islands, pp. 453-473, (1987); Fitzpatrick G.L., Modlin M.J., Direct-line Distances: United States Edition, (1986); Greenwood M., McDowell J., The supply of immigrants to the United States, The Gateway: U.S. Immigration Issues and Policies, pp. 55-85, (1982); Hofstetter R.R., Economic underdevelopment and the population explosion: Implications for U.S. immigration policy, U.S. Immigration Policy, pp. 55-79, (1984); 1992 Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, (1993); 1993 Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, (1994); Open Doors: 1981/62 Report on International Educational Exchange, (1983); The Military Balance 1980-1981, (1981); The Military Balance 1981-82, (1982); The Military Balance 1982-83, (1983); The Military Balance 1983-84, (1984); The Military Balance 1984-85, (1985); Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook; Jasso G., Rosenzweig M.R., The New Chosen People: Immigrants in the United States, (1990); Lamm R., Imhoff G., The Immigration Time Bomb: The Fragmenting of America, (1985); Lande S., Crigler N., Trade policy as a means to reduce immigration.

Data from the 2003 and 2007 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) were merged and analysed after taking into account the weighting and the complex sampling design of the data. Trends in children’s health and racial/ethnic disparities were identified for this time period. Multivariate models were analysed to examine the association between children’s health and their family background variables, neighbourhood support and safety, and other socio-demographic variables. Race/ethnicity-specific stratified models were also performed. Our findings indicated an adverse trend in the parent-reported health among children in the U.S. from 2003 to 2007, and little progress has been made towards reducing the health disparities by race/ethnicity. Racial/ethnic disparities also existed in children’s family background and neighbourhood support and safety. Further, the health effects of family background and neighbourhood characteristics differed in magnitudes and directions by race/ethnicity. These findings suggest that different intervention/prevention strategies should be employed in improving childhood health for different racial/ethnic groups. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children’s health; family; neighbourhood; racial/ethnic disparities; trends","Adolescent; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Family Health; Female; Health Status Disparities; Health Surveys; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; adolescent; Article; child; child health; family health; female; health disparity; human; infant; male; multivariate analysis; neighborhood health; newborn; priority journal; public health; race difference; regression analysis; United States; child health; demography; ethnology; family health; health survey; preschool child; socioeconomics; trends; United States","","","","","","","Akinbami L.J., Schoendorf K.C., Trends in childhood asthma: Prevalence, health care utilization, and mortality, Pediatrics, 110, 2, pp. 315-322, (2002); Alba R., Logan J., Bellair P., Living with crime: The implications of racial/ethnic differences in suburban location, Social Forces, 73, 2, pp. 395-434, (1994); Angier H., DeVoe J.E., Tillotson C., Wallace L., Gold R., Trends in health insurance status of US children and their parents, 1998–2008, Maternal and Child Health Journal, 17, 9, pp. 1550-1558, (2013); Bell D., Breland D., Ott M., Adolescent and young adult male health: A review, Pediatrics, 132, pp. 5353-5546, (2013); Blumberg S., Olson L., Frankel M., Osborn L., Srinath K., Giambo P., Design and operation of the national survey of children’s health, 2003.

Building on influential theories or models for explaining HSU and especially Andersen’s widely used health behavior model, this article proposes a theoretical framework for explaining disparities in immigrant HSU. The proposed framework explains disparities in immigrant HSU by the health care need, resources, and predisposing factors of immigrants, and macrostructural/contextual conditions at both the general and immigrant-specific levels, as well as the mediating relationships among some of these factors. It is believed that this new framework can offer a fuller understanding of the determination process of immigrant HSU. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","disparities; health service utilization; immigrant;

Using data from the 2008 Pilot Survey of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, a series of multilevel logistic models were estimated in SAS 9.2. The association between social capital and self-rated health was examined among 996 adults aged 45 or older from two provinces in China, while controlling for demographic characteristics and socioeconomic variables. Our results suggest the significant association between certain aspects of social capital, at both the individual and the community level, and self-rated health.

Ethnic differences in the propensity to become naturalized US citizens were analysed among four panethnic groups and across thirty-three major ethnic groups. The results point to the continuing significance of ethnicity in the naturalization process. However, the effect of ethnicity is not as strong as the effects of other structural factors. Three hypotheses that attempt to explain ethnic differences in the propensity for naturalization were also tested. The evidence lends strong support to the forced self-protection hypothesis, but it provides no support for the discrimination hypothesis and the cultural differences hypothesis. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The results show the determinants of intermarriages among Asian immigrants with the findings supporting the hypotheses for age, sex, income, education, English proficiency, length of residency, and migration. Results also support most of the hypotheses for status inconsistency on income and education across householders and spouses.

We derive hypotheses from sociological theories of generations regarding race/ethnicity, gender, and immigrant generation and test these hypotheses using a measure that accounts for the proportion of peers within a given peer network that are of the same immigrant generation. Results show that generational ties decreased the odds of alcohol misuse for immigrants and that these effects depend partly on race/ethnicity and gender. We conclude that generational ties play a meaningful role in the health and well-being of immigrant youth, and discuss possible future avenues for research on immigrant generational peers. © 2015 by the Center for Migration Studies of New York.

The analysis of data reveals a very high average naturalization rate of post-1965 Asian immigrants and a bifurcated pattern in citizenship acquisition among the six Asian immigrant groups. Furthermore, the results of a pooled logistic regression model indicate that the characteristics of Asian immigrants, ethnic communities, and countries of origin largely explain the naturalization of these Asian immigrants. Separate logistic regression models for the six groups further uncover similarities and differences in determinants of naturalization across groups. The findings suggest that in terms of naturalization rates new Asian immigrants are more assimilable than most immigrant groups, including European immigrants, and that in the foreseeable future Asian Americans are likely to become a swing vote at the local and possibly state levels and perhaps in presidential elections under some special circumstances. The findings also point to commonality and diversity in determinants of citizenship acquisition among post-1965 Asian immigrants.","Assimilation; Citizenship acquisition; Naturalization; Post-1965 Asian immigrants; Swing vote","United States; Asian immigrant; citizenship; immigrant population; voting behavior","","","","","","","Aldrich J., Nelson F., Linear Probability, Logit, and Probit Models, (1984); Asian Americans on the issues: The results of a National Survey of Asian American voters, Asian Week, (1996); Barringer H., Et al., Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, (1993); Bean F., Telles E., Lowell L., Undocumented migration to the United States: Perceptions and evidence, Population and Development Review, 13, pp. 671-690, (1987); Beijbom U., Swedes in Chicago: A Demographic and Social Study of the 1846-1880 Immigration, (1971); Bernard W., Cultural determinants of naturalization, American Sociological Review, 1, pp. 943-953, (1936); Cain B., Asian-American electoral power: Imminent or illusory?, Election Politics, 5, pp. 27-30, (1988); Cheng L., Yang P., Asians: The ""model minority"" deconstructed, Ethnic Los Angeles, pp. 305-344, (1996); Evans M.D.R., Choosing to be a citizen: The time-path of citizenship in Australia, International Migration Review, 22, pp. 243-264, (1988); Garcia J.A., Political integration of Mexican immigrants: Exploration into the naturalization process, International Migration Review, 15, pp. 608-625, (1981); Gilbertson G., Singer A., Naturalization under changing conditions of membership: Dominican immigrants in New York City, Immigration Research for a New Century, pp. 157-186, (2000); Hanushek E.A., Jackson I.E., Statistical Methods for Social Sciences, (1977); Hirschman C., Wong M., Trends in socioeconomic achievement among immigrant and native-born Asian Americans, 1960-1976, Sociological Quarterly, 22, pp. 495-514, (1976); 1995 Statistical Yearbook of the INS, (1997); Jasso G., Rosenzweig M., Family reunification and the immigration multiplier: U.S. immigration law, origin-country conditions, and the reproduction of immigrants, Demography, 23, pp. 291-311, (1986); Krassowski W., Naturalization and Assimilation-Proneness of California Immigrant Populations: A Statistical Study, (1963); Liang Z., Social contact, social capital, and the naturalization process: Evidence from six immigrant groups, Social Science Research, 23, pp. 407-437, (1994); Liang Z., On the measurement of naturalization, Demography, 31, pp. 525-548, (1994); Miller J., Asian Americans head for politics, The American Enterprise, 6, pp. 56-58, (1995); Nakanishi D., The next swing vote?

Currently, there is a lack of research on this issue as data became available only recently. Using data from the newly released General Social Survey in 2018, this study examines who is more or less likely to support health insurance coverage for legal abortion. The results show that the support and opposition were about evenly divided. The findings from the logistic regression analysis reveal that, holding other variables constant, Democrats, liberals, urban residents, the more educated, and the older were more likely to support health insurance coverage for legal abortion while women, Southerners, Christians, the currently married, and those with more children were less likely to favor it, compared to their respective counterparts. Additionally, the effect of education was stronger for liberals than for non-liberals. Race, family income, and full-time work status make no difference in the outcome. The findings have significant implications for research and practices in health insurance coverage for legal abortion. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, their socioeconomic adaptation to American life has not been systematically studied. Extending previous research on post-1965 immigration to the USA, this study examines the socioeconomic adaptation of post-1991 Eastern European immigrants by focusing on their educational attainment, occupational status, and income. We test our hypotheses using data from the pooled 2006–2010 American Community Surveys and ordinary least squares regression and logistic regression. The results show that new Eastern European immigrants tend to be highly educated and professional, but their income is surprisingly low. The results of regression models indicate that the individual characteristics of immigrants largely explain their socioeconomic adaptation. In addition, such conditions in the countries of origin as gross domestic product and political and personal freedom also influence their socioeconomic performance to some extent. The implications of findings are discussed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Education; Income; Occupation; Post-1991 Eastern European immigrants; Socioeconomic adaptation","","","","","","","","Alba R., Nee V., Rethinking assimilation theory for a new era of immigration, International Migration Review, 31, 4, pp. 826-874, (1997); Alba R., Nee V., Remaking the American mainstream, (2003); Allen R., Benefit or burden?

The framework is tested for a cohort of recent immigrants, using the PUMS data from the 1980 US census. Results show that economic, political, social, cultural and geographical conditions in the country of origin, and immigrants ethnic communities and urban concentration in the country of destination, to a large extent influence immigrants' propensity for naturalization and that, net of the contextual factors, many of the immigrants' adaptation and demographic characteristics are also significant predictors of citizenship acquisition. The costs, benefits and meaning of naturalization and their intervening roles in the naturalization process are also discussed. -Author","","Acculturation; Americas; Demography; Developed Countries; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; North America; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Social Change; Transients and Migrants; United States; USA; Acculturation; Americas; Demographic Factors; Destination; Developed Countries; International Migration; Migrants; Migration; Nationality--determinants; North America; Northern America; Origin; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Social Change; United States; citizenship; immigrant naturalisation; naturalisation process; personal characteristics; social position; article; cultural factor; Demographic Factors; demography; Destination; developed country; ethnic group; International Migration; Migrants; migration; Nationality--determinants; North America; Northern America; Origin; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; sociology; United States; Western Hemisphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01979183","","","12345790","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028665643"

This study offers a comparative analysis of the changes in attitudes of whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics toward intermarriage with different racial or ethnic groups in the twenty-first century, using nationally representative samples from General Social Surveys 2000–2018. Our trend analyses reveal that whites’ support for intermarriage with minorities has generally increased, albeit at a relatively lower level; blacks’ support for intermarriage with Asians, Hispanics, and whites has been quite stable at a relatively high level; Asians’ and Hispanics’ support for intermarriage with other minorities has generally shown an upswing trend with some minor fluctuations, but their support for intermarriage with whites has gone in the opposite direction with oscillations. The results of our generalized linear ordinal logistic regression models show that either including or excluding control variables, whites’ attitudes have become generally more supportive of intermarriage with minorities, blacks’ support for intermarriage has displayed an undulated pattern, and Asians’ and Hispanics’ support for intermarriage reveal diverse patterns depending on the group to intermarry with. The findings indicate a general trend of narrowing intergroup social distances as well as some increases in social distance between certain groups in the United States in the twenty-first century. © 2021 by the authors.

The set comprised several acculturation, social structure, lifestyle, and health-related factors. Our study asked if these factors uniformly explained health outcomes across the 4 groups. We pooled National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data dating 1999–2015 and developed 2 outcomes: self-rated health and self-reported chronic illness (specifically, diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, prediabetes/diabetes, hypertension, cancer, or stroke). Since data for smaller Asian ethnic groups are not readily available, we confined our analyses to respondents of Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian, and “other Asian” ethnicity. Descriptive statistics suggested that Asian Indian respondents were least likely to report having 1 of the 5 specified serious illnesses and self-rated their health higher than the other 3 respondent groups. Additionally, while some factors (e.g., body mass index, depression) proved related to the health outcomes across the 4 ethnic groups, we did observe for each group a unique pattern of factors associated with the outcomes. Our results confirmed, furthermore, a moderating role for ethnicity in associations between the outcomes and those operating factors in the set we evaluated. The study results should be of use in tailoring preventive and intervention programs to various ethnic groups of Asian immigrants; clearly, in promoting health, one approach will not fit all. © 2019, W.

Using new data from the 2018 General Social Survey and multiple regression, this study investigates how race, gender, and class independently and intersectionally shape everyday discrimination experiences in the United States. The results indicate that, holding other variables constant, Blacks self-claimed a significantly higher level of everyday discrimination than Whites, but other races did not differ significantly from Whites in such an experience; class was inversely associated with the level of everyday discrimination, and gender did not have an independent effect. However, while Black men self-reported a higher level of everyday discrimination than White men, Black women self-reported a lower level of everyday discrimination than White women; higher-class Blacks tended to report a significantly higher level of everyday discrimination experiences than lower-class Blacks. The findings have significant implications for research and practice in the area of everyday discrimination. © 2024, Florida Gulf Coast University.

In spite of the phenomenal growth of the Nepalese diaspora in the USA in the last more than two decades, little is known about this new diasporic community, especially regarding how the Nepalese adapt to American life. This study documents the rapid growth in Nepalese immigration to the USA in the twenty-first century, based on data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Using the data from an online survey, it analyzes the experiences of the Nepalese in cultural adaptation, structural adaptation, marital adaptation, identificational adaptation, and receptional adaptation. The results show that although the Nepalese have become partly assimilated to American culture, they still to a large extent retain their ethnic culture, ethnic association, ethnic identity, and ethnic marital partners, and they have had mixed experiences of prejudice and discrimination. The findings have significant scholarly and practical implications. © 2024 by the authors.","adaptation; cultural pluralism; migration; Nepalese diaspora; USA","","","","","","","","Adhikari A., The Nepali Diaspora’s Role in National Development, Policy Design and Practice, 6, pp. 357-380, (2023); Alba R., Nee V., Special Issue: Immigrant Adaptation and Native-born Responses in the Making of Americans, International Migration Review, 31, pp. 826-874, (1997); Alba R., Nee V., Remaking the American Mainstream, (2003); Bennett L., Dangerous Wives and Sacred Sisters: Social and Symbolic Roles of High-Caste Women in Nepal, (1983); National Population and Housing Census 2021, (2021); Dhungel R.K., Nepalese Immigrants in the United States of America, Contribution to Nepalese Studies, 26, pp. 119-134, (1999); Gordon M., Assimilation in American Life: The Role of Race, Religion and National Origins, (1964); Gubhaju B., The Fluidity of Ethnicity: The Case of Nepali and Newar Identity in the United States, Contribution to Nepalese Studies, 26, pp. 119-134, (1999); Gurung H., Linguistic Demographic of Nepal, Contribution to Nepalese Studies, 24, pp. 147-185, (1997); Gurung H., Social Demography of Nepal: Census 2001, (2003); Open Doors International Students Data, (2023); Migration in Nepal: A Country Profile 2019, (2019); Joshi M., Mason T.D., Peasants, Patrons, and Parties: The Tension between Clientelism and Democracy in Nepal, International Studies Quarterly, 55, pp. 151-175, (2011); Koirala S., Exploring Solutions at the Intersection of Education, Immigration and Transnationalism: Efforts of the Diaspora in Nepali Social Change, Ph.D. dissertation, (2004); Lee S.M., Yamanaka K., Patterns of Asian American Intermarriage and Marital Assimilation, Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 31, pp. 287-305, (1990); Lee S.M., Fernandez M., Trends in Asian American Racial/Ethnic Intermarriage: A Comparison of 1980 and 1990 Census Data, Sociological Perspectives, 41, pp. 323-342, (1998); Mihaly E.B., Foreign Aid and Politics in Nepal: A Case Study, (1965); Nagel J., Constructing Ethnicity: Creating and Recreating Ethnic Identity and Culture, Social Problems, 41, pp. 152-168, (1994); Park R.E., Our Racial Frontier on the Pacific, Race and Culture, pp. 138-151, (1937); Portes A., Zhou M., The New Second-Generation: Segmented Assimilation and Its Variants among Post-1965 Immigrant Youth, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences, 530, pp. 74-98, (1993); Purkayastha B., Negotiating Ethnicity: Second-Generation South Asian Americans Traverse a Transnational World, (2005); Qian Z., Who Intermarries?

Results show that the most dominant pattern of marriage among foreign-born Asians was still intra-ethnic marriage and that interracial marriage, especially with whites, rather than interethnic marriage among Asians, remained the dominant pattern of intermarriages. Out of all foreign-born Asian marriages, inter-Asian marriages stayed at only about 3%. Among all foreign-born Asian groups, Japanese were most likely to marry interracially and interethnically, while Asian Indians had the lowest rates of interracial marriage and interethnic marriage. Foreign-born Asian women were more likely to interracially marry, especially with whites, than foreign-born Asian men, but they were not much different from foreign-born Asian men in terms of their interethnic marriage rate. The findings have significant implications for intermarriage research, assimilation, and Asian American panethnicity. © 2018 by the authors.

Focusing on Asian immigrants, this article demonstrates that much insight into immigrant quality can be gained via a diversity approach. Using the 5% PUMS data of the 1990 U.S. census, this paper shows that a common perception that the quality of post-1965 immigrants is lower than natives and earlier immigrants is invalid for post-1965 Asian immigrants. Unlike their Latin American counterparts, post-1965 Asian immigrants are generally more educated and skilled than natives. The educational level of post-1965 Asian immigrants surpasses that of their pre-1965 counterparts, despite their disadvantage in occupational attainment due to their shorter time of adaptation. Diversity also characterizes educational and occupational attainment across major post-1965 Asian immigrant groups and within each Asian immigrant group before and after 1965. Gender does not alter the advantage of post-1965 Asian immigrants over natives and their pre-1965 parallels in education, but it does complicate their occupational status.

The secondary data, gathered in National Health Measurement Study (NHMS) in 2008 and 2010, was used. The authors identify the relationships between health insurance and ER referrals by using zero-inflated binomial and zero-inflated Poisson regression. About 17% (2008) and 20% (2010) of the respondents had one or more ER referrals in the 2 years; those who were under coverage of governmental health insurance are more likely to refer ER than uninsured group. The differences in ER referrals that ended with hospital admission across different insurance policies are not significant. Health insurance is a remarkable factor in ER referrals; the coverage of health insurance plans can affect consuming the services provided in ER. Governmental insurance plans can increase ER referrals.

In this article we integrate social location theory and political predisposition theory to provide a framework of explanation and test these theories using a unique sample from the 1998 General Social Survey. Our multivariate results reveal that social structural positions along the lines of race, gender, class and age play a more important role than political predispositions in explain-ing individual differences in support for the current Social Security system against privatisation. Political party affiliation also partly contributes to variation in support for Social Security, but political ideology does not have a significant effect. Our results suggest that with regard to support for Social Security, primary consideration must rest on social structural positions. Racial minorities, women, the poor and the elderly tend to dislike a drastic change in the current Social Security system, and Social Security reform ought to pay attention to their concerns. Our robust finding of a positive relationship between age and support for Social Security also challenges much of the established knowledge, pointing to an intergenerational discord over Social Security. It is also important to differentiate among social welfare programmes in order to uncover the real determinants of public attitudes towards them. © 2006 The Author(s), Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the International Journal of Social Welfare.","Attitudes; Explanation; Political predisposition theory; Social location theory; Social Security; United States of America","","","","","","","","Abramson P., Political Attitudes in America: Formation and Change, (1983); Acker J., Class, gender, and the relations of distributions, Signs, 13, pp. 473-497, (1988); Attarian J., Social Security: False consciousness and crisis, (2002); Baggette J., Shapiro R., Jacobs L., The polls - Poll trends: Social Security - An update, Public Opinion Quarterly, 59, pp. 420-442, (1995); Baker D., Weisbrot M., Social Security: The Phony Crisis, (2000); Becker G., The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, (1976); Bengtson V., Is the 'contract across generations' changing?

Factors influencing personal and public PEBs may or may not be the same. Only a few studies have empirically investigated the determinants of personal and public PEBs simultaneously, but they contain major limitations with mixed results. This study develops a conceptual model for explaining both personal and public PEBs that incorporate demographic, socioeconomic, political, and attitudinal variables, and their direct and indirect effects. Using the latest available data from the 2010 General Social Survey and structural equation modeling (SEM), we tested the determinants of both personal and public PEBs in the United States. The results reveal that environmental concerns, education, and political orientation demonstrate similar significant impacts on both personal and public PEBs, but income, gender, race, urban/rural residency, region, and party affiliation have differential effects on these behaviors.

It is found that 19% of the American adults self-reported the experience of employment discrimination in job application, pay increase, or promotion in the past 5 years. The results of logistic regression analysis show that either controlling or not controlling for other factors, Blacks were much more likely to perceive being discriminated in employment than Whites, but other races were not significantly different from Whites in perceived employment discrimination after holding other variables constant. While gender did not have a significant independent effect on perceived job discrimination, it did interact with race to influence perceived job discrimination. Regardless of race, women were somewhat less likely than men to perceive job discrimination, but Black women were significantly even less likely than White women to self-report job discrimination, and Black men were much more likely to self-report employment discrimination than White men. These findings have implications for combating employment discrimination and addressing social inequalities. © The Author(s) 2021.","Blacks and Whites; gender; perceived employment discrimination; race","","","","","","","","Bumiller K., The civil rights society, (1988); Burke R.J., Work experience of minority managers and professionals: Individual and organizational costs of perceived bias, Psychological Reports, 69, pp. 1011-1023, (1991); Campbell K., Will equal again mean equal?

Guided by this analytical framework, we tested the structural determinants of highly skilled migration to the United States. The evidence confirms our hypotheses that economic and educational interactions between sending countries and the United States increase the flow of the highly trained to the United States. Results also provide mixed proof for our hypotheses that levels of professional migration are positively associated with disparities between sending countries and the United States in living conditions, research conditions, children's educational opportunities, political conditions, and professional employment opportunities.","","United States; income distribution; labor migration; migration determinant; skilled labor","","","","","","","Agarwal V.B., Winkler D.R., Migration of Professional Manpower to the United States, Southern Economic Journal, 50, 3, pp. 814-830, (1984); Anderson P.Y., Manpower Losses and Employment Adequacy among Skilled Workers in Jamaica 1976-1985, When Borders Don't Divide: Labor Migration and Refugee Movements in the Americas, (1988); Bentler P.M., EQS: Structural Equations Program Manual, (1989); Latent Variable Structural Models for Separating Specific from General Effects, Report Prepared for the Health Services Research Conference, ""Strengthening Causal Interpretations of Nonexperimental Data,"", (1987); 1990 Census of Population and Housing: Public use Microdata Samples, United States, (1992); Gastil R.D., The Comparative Survey of Freedom XI, Freedom at Issues, (1985); Grubel H.G., Scott A., The Brain Drain: Determinants, Measurement and Welfare Effects, (1977); Henderson G., Emigration of Highly Skilled Manpower from the Developing Countries, (1970); 1988 Statistical Yearbook of the INS, (1989); Immigrants Admitted to the United States, 1988, (1989); Open Doors: 1990/91, (1992); Open Doors: 1986/1987, (1987); Kritz M.M., The Global Picture of Contemporary Immigration Patterns, Pacific Bridges: The New Immigration from Asia and the Pacific Islands, pp. 29-51, (1987); Liu J., Cheng L., Pacific Rim Development and the Duality of Post-1965 Asian Immigration to the United States, The New Asian Immigration in Los Angeles and Global Restructuring, pp. 74-99, (1994); Handbook of Economic Statistics, 1987, (1987); Ong P.M., Cheng L., Evans L., Migration of Highly Educated Asians and Global Dynamics, Asian and Pacific Migration Journal, 1, 3-4, pp. 543-567, (1992); Ong P., Liu J., U.

Our trend analyses reveal that, since 2000, nearly two thirds or more of Americans have strongly favored, favored, or held a neutral stance on, intermarriage with Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics, but favorable attitudes toward intermarriage with non-Hispanic Whites have either been generally steady or even slightly declined. Our generalized linear ordinal logistic regression analyses show that either including or excluding control variables, American attitudes have become generally more supportive of intermarriage with Blacks since 2002, with Asians since 2008, and with Hispanics since 2010, but have witnessed insignificant undulating changes in support for intermarriage with non-Hispanic Whites in the twenty-first century. The findings have significant implications for social progress and inter-group relations, hierarchies, and distances in the United States. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","American attitudes; comparative perspective; intermarriage; trends; twenty-first century","","","","","","","","Allport G., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Batson C.D., Qian Z., Lichter D.T., Interracial and intraracial patterns of mate selection among America’s diverse black populations, Journal of Marriage and Family, 68, 3, pp. 658-672, (2006); Carroll J., Most Americans approve of interracial marriages: Blacks more likely than whites to approve of black-white unions, (2007); Djamba Y.K., Kimuna S.R., Are Americans really in favor of interracial marriage?

Using data from the 1998, 2002, and 2006 General Social Surveys- nationally representative samples-and ordinary least squares regression, this study reexamines this issue. It was expected that blacks are less likely to trust their doctors than whites either before or after controlling for other predictors of trust and that there was no significant change in this relationship over the time period under study. The results indicate that blacks were less likely to trust their doctors than whites only in 2002, but not in 1998 and 2006. This finding suggests that, even with the same source of data, empirical support for the claim about the less trust of blacks in doctors than whites is less robust than conventional belief, and it calls for additional, careful reexamination. © The Author(s) 2012.","African americans; Black-white difference; Blacks; Trust in doctors; Whites","","","","","","","","Adegbembo A.O., Tomar S.L., Logan H.L., Perception of racism explains the difference between blacks' and whites' level of healthcare trust, Ethnicity & Disease, 16, pp. 792-798, (2006); Benjamins M.R., Religious influences on trust in physicians and the health care system, International Journal of Psychiatry In Medicine, 36, pp. 69-83, (2006); Berrios-Rivera J., Street Jr. R.L., Popa-Lisseanu M.G., Kallen M.A., Richardson M.N., Janssen N.M., Suarez-Almazor M., Trust in physicians and elements of the medical interaction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, Arthritis & Rheumatism, 55, pp. 385-393, (2006); Bonds D.E., Foley K.L., Dugan E., Hall M.A., Extrom P., An exploration of patient's trust in physicians in training, Journal of Health Care For the Poor and Underserved, 15, pp. 294-306, (2004); Boulware L.E., Cooper L.A., Ratner L.E., Laveist T.A., Powe N.R., Race and trust in the health care system, Public Health Reports, 118, pp. 358-365, (2003); Corbie-Smith G., Thomas S.B., St. George D.M., Distrust, race, and research, Archives of Internal Medicine, 162, pp. 2458-2463, (2002); Doescher M.P., Saver B.G., Franks P., Fiscella K., Racial and ethnic disparities in perceptions of physician style and trust, Archives of Family Medicine, 9, pp. 1156-1163, (2000); Gamble V.N., Under the shadow of Tuskegee: African Americans and healthcare, American Journal of Public Health, 87, pp. 1773-1778, (1997); Hall M.A., Dugan E., Zheng B., Mishra A.K., Trust in physicians and medical institutions: What is it, can it be measured, and does it matter?, Milbank Quarterly, 79, pp. 613-639, (2001); Hall M.A., Zheng B., Dugan E., Camacho F., Kidd K.E., Mishra A., Balkrishnan R., Measuring patient's trust in their primary care providers, Medical Care Research and Review, 59, pp. 293-318, (2002); Hunt K.A., Gaba A., Lavizzo-Mourey R., Racial and ethnic disparities and perceptions of health care: Does health plan type matter?, Health Services Research, 40, pp. 551-576, (2005); Kao A.C., Green D.C., Davis N.A., Koplan J.P., Cleary P.D., Patients' trust in their physicians, Journal of Internal Medicine, 13, pp. 681-686, (1998); Kennedy B.R., Mathis C.C., Woods A.K., African Americans and their distrust of the health care system: Healthcare for diverse populations, Journal of Cultural Diversity, 14, pp. 56-60, (2007); Lee Y., Lin J.L., The effects of trust in physician on self-efficacy, adherence and diabetes outcomes, Social Science & Medicine, 68, pp. 1060-1068, (2009); Minniefield W.J., Yang J., Muti P., Differences in attitudes toward organ donation among African Americans and whites in the United States, Journal of the National Medical Association, 93, pp. 372-379, (2001); Musa D., Schulz R., Harris E., Silverman M., Thomas S.B., Trust in the health care system and the use of preventative health services by older black and white adults, Public Health, 99, pp. 1293-1299, (2009); O'Malley A.S., Scheppard V.B., Schwartz M., Mandelblatt J., The role of trust in use of preventative services among low-income African-American women, Preventative Medicine, 38, pp. 777-785, (2004); Pescosolido B.A., Tuch S.A., Martin J.K., The profession of medicine and the public: Examining Americans' changing confidence in physician authority from the beginning of the ""health care crisis"" to the era of health care reform, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 42, pp. 1-16, (2001); Safran D.G., Kosinski M., Tarlov A.R., Rogers W.H., Taira D.A., Lieberman N., Ware J.E., The primary care assessment survey: Tests of data quality and measurement performance, Medical Care, 36, pp. 728-739, (1998); Safran D.G., Taira D.A., Rogers W.H., Kosinski M., Ware J.E., Tarlov A.R., Linking primary care performance to outcomes of care, Journal of Family Practice, 47, pp. 213-220, (1998); Shavers V.L., Lynch C.F., Burmeister L.F., Racial differences in factors that influence the willingness to participate in medical research studies, Annals of Epidemiology, 12, pp. 248-256, (2002); Stepanikova I., Mollborn S., Cook K.S., Thom D.H., Kramer R.M., Patient's race, ethnicity, language, and trust in a physician, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 47, pp. 390-405, (2006); Taira D.A., Safran D.G., Seto T.B., Rogers W.H., Inui T.S., Montgomery J., Tarlov A.R., Do patient assessments of primary care differ by patient ethnicity?, Health Services Research, 36, pp. 1059-1071, (2001); Thom D.H., Ribisl K.M., Stewart A.L., Luke D.A., Further validation and reliability testing of the trust in physician scale, Medical Care, 37, pp. 510-517, (1999)","T.

It is important to evaluate the effectiveness of the ACA in order to make rational decisions about the ongoing healthcare reform, but existing research into its effect on health insurance status in the United States is insufficient and descriptive. Using data from the National Health Interview Surveys from 2009 to 2015, this study examines changes in health insurance status and its determinants before the ACA in 2009, during its partial implementation in 2010–2013, and after its full implementation in 2014 and 2015. The results of trend analysis indicate a significant increase in national health insurance rate from 82.2% in 2009 to 89.4% in 2015. Logistic regression analyses confirm the similar impact of age, gender, race, marital status, nativity, citizenship, education, and poverty on health insurance status before and after the ACA. Despite similar effects across years, controlling for other variables, youth aged 26 or below, the foreign-born, Asians, and other races had a greater probability of gaining health insurance after the ACA than before the ACA; however, the odds of obtaining health insurance for Hispanics and the impoverished rose slightly during the partial implementation of the ACA, but somewhat declined after the full implementation of the ACA starting in 2014. These findings should be taken into account by the U.S. Government in deciding the fate of the ACA. © 2021 by the authors.","determinants; full implementation; health insurance coverage; Obamacare; partial implementation; the Affordable Care Act","","","","","","","","The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Donald Trump Says He May Keep Parts of Obamacare Health Care Act; Cohen R.A., Martinez M.E., Health Insurance Coverage: Early Release of Estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, 2014, (2015); Schoen C., Collins S.R., Kriss J.L., Doty M.M., How Many Are Underinsured?

An interesting finding is that wives' education has a significant, negative effect on fertility while the effect of husbands' education is positive and statistically insignificant. This suggests that the generalization of the negative effect of education on fertility may be misleading if one fails to make a distinction between marital partners. Meanwhile, this study finds no significant differences in the effects of husbands' and wives' occupational and work statuses on fertility. By and large, the husbands' status variables add little information to the models explaining fertility. It is also found that the effects of husbands' and wives' statuses are contingent upon their relative education. © 1993 Human Sciences Press, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Bagozzi R.P., Van Loo M.F., Decision-making and fertility: A theory of exchange in the family, Demographic Behavior: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Decision-Making, (1980); Beckman, A theoretical analysis of antecedents of young couple's fertility decisions and outcomes, Demography, 20, 4, pp. 519-533, (1983); Beckman, Husbands' and wives' relative influence on fertility decisions and outcomes, Population and Environment, 7, 3, pp. 182-197, (1984); Beckman L.J., Houser B.B., Perceived satisfactions and costs of motherhood and employment among married women, Journal of Population, 2, pp. 306-327, (1979); Blau, Duncan, The American occupational structure, (1967); Bouvier L.F., Rao S.L.N., Socioreligious factors in fertility decline, (1975); Clarridge, Sibling fertility: From family of orientation to family of procreation, (1983); Coombs, Chang, Do husbands and wives agree? fertility attitudes and later behavior, Population and Environment, 4, 2, pp. 109-127, (1981); Duncan, Freedman, Coble J.M., Slesinger D.P., Marital fertility and size of family of orientation, Demography, 2, pp. 508-515, (1965); Evans M.D.R., American fertility patterns: A comparison of white and nonwhite cohorts born 1903–1956, Population and Development Review, 12, pp. 267-293, (1986); Fried E.S., Udry J.R., Wives and husbands' expected costs and benefits of childbearing as predictors of pregnancy, Social Biology, 26, 4, pp. 265-275, (1979); Fried E.S., Hofferth S.L., Udry J.R., Parity-specific and two-sex utility models of reproductive intentions, Demography, 17, 1, pp. 1-11, (1980); Janssen, Hauser, Religion, socialization and fertility, Demography, 18, 4, pp. 511-528, (1981); Lewis-Beck, Applied regression: An introduction, (1980); Lowery, Child custody in divorce: Parents' decisions and perceptions, Family Relations, 34, 2, pp. 241-249, (1985); Sorenson, Husbands' and wives' characteristics and fertility decisions: A diagonal mobility model, Demography, 26, 1, pp. 125-135, (1989); Thoon E., Individual and couple utility of children, Demography, 20, 4, pp. 507-518, (1983); Townes B.D., Beach L.R., Campbell F.L., Wood R.L., Family building: A social psychological study of fertility decisions, Population and Environment, 3, pp. 210-220, (1980); Yaukey D., Griffiths W., Roberts B.J., Couple concurrence and empathy on birth control motivation in Dacca, East Pakistan, American Sociological Review, 32, pp. 716-726, (1967)","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers-Human Sciences Press","","","","","","15737810","","","","English","Popul Environ","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0039762005"

This study argues and demonstrates that the Bangladeshi diaspora in the USA is a fast-growing and sizable diasporic community that requires systematic research and better understanding. It delineates the history of the Bangladeshi diaspora to the USA in four periods and documents the phenomenal growth of the Bangladeshi diasporic community in the USA since 1981, using data from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). By taking into account the legal Bangladeshi immigration as well as the emigration and mortality rates of immigrants and undocumented Bangladeshi immigration, it estimates the current size of the Bangladeshi diasporic community in the USA at about 500,000 instead of a range of low-to-mid 200,000s normally cited. Additionally, using the pooled samples of the 2001–2019 American Community Surveys (ACS) and other ACS data, as well as the DHS data, this paper provides a demographic and socioeconomic portrait of the Bangladeshi diasporic community in the USA. The findings are generalizable to the population and fill some important gaps in the literature. © 2023 by the authors.","Bangladeshi diaspora; history; migration; profile; USA","","","","","","","","Ahmad A., Bangladeshi Americans, Multicultural America: An Encyclopedia of the Newest Americans, pp. 109-148, (2011); Ahmed S., Bangladesh: Past and Present, (2004); Anam K.M., The Bangladeshi Americans, Bengali Immigrants: Making America Home, pp. 45-52, (2019); Bald V., ‘Lost’ in the City: Spaces and Stories of South Asian New York, 1917–1965, South Asian Popular Culture, 5, pp. 59-76, (2007); Bald V., Bengali Harlem and the Lost Histories of South Asian America, (2013); Bald V., American Orientalism, Dissent, 62, pp. 23-34, (2015); Bharucha N.E., The Indian Diaspora and Laws, Diaspora, Law and Literature, pp. 247-272, (2016); Bhattacharya G., Schoppelrey S.L., Preimmigration Beliefs of Life Success, Postimmigration Experiences, and Acculturative Stress: South Asian Immigrants in the United States, Journal of Immigrant Health, 6, pp. 83-92, (2004); Borjas G., Bratsberg B., Who Leaves?
