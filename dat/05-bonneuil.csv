The proof of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions results from those of a special set, the invariance envelope. It is also valid in presence of state constraints, and solutions need only to have a closed graph (instead of being weakly differentiable as requested in semi-group theory). Moreover, this invariance envelope provides a simple way to build the solutions, either explicitly in the linear exogenous case, or algorithmically in the non-linear case, both with co-variates. The case of age-structured systems and a model of demographic transition are discussed for illustration.","Lotka-McKendrick; Viability theory Communicated by S.

The set of initial conditions from which a given objective can be reached is calculated using the Hybrid Guaranteed Capture Basin Algorithm. This algorithm was developed in finance to evaluate options in absence of impulse but in the presence of uncertainty and in control to evaluate minimal time functions to reach a target, in the presence of impulse but in absence of uncertainty. We study the problem of reaching a target in the presence of both impulse and uncertainty and present two applications in economics. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","","Economics; Hybrid systems; In-control; Initial conditions; Time function; Algorithms","","","","","","","Aubin J.-R., Bayen A., Bonneuil N., Saint-Pierre P., Viability, Control and Game Theories: Regulation of Complex Evolutionary Systems under Uncertainty; Aubin J.-P., Gatte F., Fixed-Point and Algebraic Properties of Viability Kernels and Capture Basins of Sets, Set-valued Analysis, 10, pp. 379-416, (2002); Aubin J.-P., Da Prato G., The Viability Theorem for Stochastic Differential Inclusions, Stochastic Analysis and Applications, 16, pp. 1-15, (1998); Aubin J.-P., Doss H., Characterization of Stochastic Viability of any Nonsmooth Set Involving its Generalized Contingent Curvature, Stochastic Analysis and Applications, 25, pp. 951-981, (2003); Aubin J.-P., Frankowska H., Set-valued Analysis, (1990); Aubin J.-P., Pujal D., Saint-Pierre P., Dynamic Management of Portfolios with Transaction Costs under Tychastic Uncertainty, (2001); Aubin J.-P., Viability Theory, (1991); Aubin J.-P., A Concise Introduction to Dynamical Games: A Viability Approach, Ninth International Symposium on Dynamical Games and Applications, (2000); Aubin J.-P., Viability Kernels and Capture Basins of Sets under Differential Inclusions, SIAM J.

Here, population size is considered as capable of varying, and the set of the at least 95% most probable population paths capable of producing the observed mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences is delineated. To do this, the mean and the variance of coalescence times of two genes taken in an n-genes sample with varying population size are expressed. The observed mean coalescence time already echoed a set of population paths due to the variance associated to the coalescent process, but only specific scenarios have been studied, such as the bottleneck or the exponential function. However, mitochondrial DNA data does not reflect a single scenario, after the effect of the variance. These scenarios implied by pairwise nucleotide differences are described through a set-valued function, the 'regulation map', a convenient way to represent temporal population paths.","","Base Composition; Base Sequence; Confidence Intervals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genetics, Population; Humans; Mathematics; Models, Genetic; Probability; mitochondrial DNA; article; base pairing; DNA sequence; genetic variability; mathematical analysis; population genetics; priority journal","","DNA, Mitochondrial, ","","","National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (R01GM040282); National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS","","Aubin J.-P., Viability Theory, (1991); Beloch K.J., Bevölkerungsgeschichte Italiens, (1961); Bertorelle G., Slatkin M., The number of segregating sites in expanding human populations with implications for estimates of demographic parameters, Mol.

Total fertility rates are reconstructed for the 4905 qism, qarya, medina, markaz and shiyakhat covering non-desert Egypt at the 1960, 1976, 1986 and 1996 censuses. This fine spatial scale reveals that heterogeneity across subdivisions increased during the fertility transition, illustrating the rapidity of change. Spatial patterns appear in the fertility upsurge of 1974-85, which is accompanied by a large but temporary reduction in heterogeneity. Fertility varies greatly between subdivisions and geographic differentials underlie the expected and observed association between fertility, literacy, family transfers and industrialization. Cairo led the decline of fertility, but that decline is counterbalanced by rapid economic growth and persistently high levels of illiteracy. A similar pattern of fertility change is observed for the chief city of the Muhafaza and its surrounding area. Egypt presents an archetype of demographic transition as improved economic and educational status diffuses across the country, moderated by its specific geography.","Census data; Demographic transition;

Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, France","The perpetuation of three-trophic level ecosystems where the three species exhibit unpredictable time-varying survival strategies is described by a specific set, the viability kernel, gathering all states from which there exists at least one trajectory safeguarding each species over a given density threshold. The strategies permitting this property are delineated and called viable strategies. All solutions starting outside the viability kernel lead to too low densities or extinction. The viability approach highlights the timing of strategy changes necessary for a system to perpetuate itself or alternatively to lead one species to extinction. The study of the dependence of the viability kernel on the admissible sets of strategies reveals the minimal flexibilities necessary for the existence of the system. The shape of the viability kernel determines whether the exogenous addition or substraction of prey or predator will endanger the system or not, thus gathering different experiments with opposite results. The comparison of the coexistence kernel with viability kernels for one, two or three species points out the importance of repeated strategies, not necessarily in a periodic manner, thus emphasizing the concept of repetitions in ecosystems instead of cycles as a key feature of coexistence. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Usual linear techniques have proved poor, but nonlinear techniques may help us to find out some temporal qualitative structure, and to take into account breakdown phenomena. For instance, the 1931-1985 fluctuations may be better described by drawing first return functions, which show a precise qualitative behaviour: two attractors exchanging the trajectory in the phase space under the perturbing environment of the historical context. A second example is drawn from a 17th century population, at a time when people were submitted to high and very irregular mortality. Because of the stochastic nature of the process, attractors are difficult to determine, and we resort to tools which are different from usual asymptotic attractors. These tools, called confiners, are the stochastic analogue of the notion of attractor for stochastic dynamical processes. They have been defined by Cosnard and Demongeot on the basis of the set of accumulation points of the trajectory, and rely on the essential intuitive property of invariance through the double operation consisting first in searching the confining basin of a set, then in taking the limit of this basin. The notion of confiner enables a rigourous description of the equilibrium states of the process: For fertility fluctuations during the 17th century, it reveals two confining zones exchanging the trajectory. Moreover, a simulation system shows how the existence of these two zones are directly linked to the frequency v of mortality crisis occurring, that is to say, according to the value v, the population dynamics will more or less balance towards a resistance to the crisis or towards a usual renewal of the population. © 1992 J.C.

Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, France","Lotka-Volterra equations are considered a dynamical game, where the phenotypes of the predator and of the prey can vary. This differs from the usual procedure of specifying as a priori laws according to which strategies are supposed to change. The question at stake is the survival of each of the species, instead of the maximization of a given pay-off by each player, as it is commonly discussed in games. The predator needs the prey, while the prey can survive without the predator. These obvious and simplistic constraints are enough to shape the regulation of the system: notably, the largest closed set of initial conditions can be delineated, from which there exists at least one evolutionary path where the population can avoid extinction forever. To these so-called viable trajectories, viable strategies are associated, respectively for the prey or for the predator. A coexistence set can then be defined. Within this set and outside the boundary, strategies can vary arbitrarily within given bounds while remaining viable, whereas on the boundary, only specific strategies can guarantee the viability of the system.

To characterize its timing, escalation is viewed as a viability (differential) game in progress under the protagonists’ actions. The chronicle of confrontations and accommodations allows for estimating a responsiveness structure at the heart of the game. As the moves, which are the controls, are observed, and not the state variables, the game reduces to the minimization of a viability criterion under dynamics. Early estimation of the responsiveness structure operationalizes the procedure for crisis management and provides a way to anticipate the consequences of possible moves in escalations to conflict. The application to July 1914 shows the strength of the method. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Differential games; operational research; propensity for war; security concern; viability game","","","","","","","","Ayache G., 1914, une guerre par accident, (2011); Bonneuil N., Viability in dynamic social networks, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 24, 3, pp. 175-182, (2000); Bonneuil N., Population growth and Nash equilibria under viability constraints in the commons, Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 176, pp. 478-491, (2018); Bonneuil N., Auriat N., Fifty years of ethnic conflict and cohesion, Journal of Peace Research, 37, 5, pp. 563-581, (2000); Bonneuil N., Mullers P., Viable populations in a prey-predator system, Journal of Mathematical Biology, 35, pp. 261-293, (1997); Brams S.J., Superpower games, (1985); Brams S.J., Theory of moves, (1994); Brams S.J., Game theory and the humanities: Bridging two worlds, (2011); Buckdahn R., Cardialaguet P., Quincampoix M., Some recent aspects of differential game theory, Dynamic Games and Applications, 1, pp. 74-114, (2011); Cardialaguet P., A differential game with two players and one target, SIAM Journal Control and Optimization, 34, 4, pp. 1441-1460, (1996); Casper G., Wilson M., Using sequences to model crises, Political Science Research and Methods, 3, 2, pp. 381-397, (2015); Colaresi M.P., Rasler K., Thompson W.R., Strategic rivalries in world politics: Position, space and conflict escalation, (2008); Colaresi M.P., Thompson W.R., Strategic rivalries, protracted conflict, and crisis escalation, Journal of Peace Research, 39, 3, pp. 263-287, (2002); Dobbs M., One minute to midnight: Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro on the brink of nuclear war, (2008); Duggan J., Noisy stochastic games, Econometrica, 80, 5, pp. 2017-2045, (2012); Felsenstein J., Parsimony in systematics: Biological and statistical issues, Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 14, 1, pp. 313-333, (1983); Flynn J.O., Lion and man: The boundary constraints, SIAM Journal on Control, 11, (1973); Fraser N.M., Hipel K.W., Dynamic modelling of the Cuban missile crisis, Conflict Management and Peace Science, 6, pp. 1-18, (1982); Fudenberg D., Tirole J., Game theory, (1991); Gurr T.R., Why minorities rebel: A global analysis of communal mobilization and conflict since 1945, International Political Science Review, 14, 2, pp. 161-201, (1993); Harsanyi J.C., Rational behavior and bargaining equilibrium in games and social situations, (1977); Howard N., Paradoxes of rationality: Theory of metagames and political behavior, (1971); Isaacs R., Differential Games, (1965); Jervis R., Perceptions and misperceptions in international politics, (1976); Jervis R., War and misperception, Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 18, 4, pp. 675-700, (1988); Kalman R.E., A new approach to linear filtering and prediction problems, Journal of Basic Engineering, 82, pp. 35-45, (1960); Kaplan A., The conduct of inquiry, (1964); Levy J.S., Vasquez J.A., The outbreak of the First World War: Structure, politics, and decision-making, (2014); Mailath G.J., Samuelson L., Repeated games and reputations: Long-run relationships, (2006); Morrow J.D., Game theory for political scientists, (1994); Otte T.G., July crisis.

However, post-mortem data are subject to duration censoring. Aim: This study aimed to provide a continuous-time view of ageing in the human brain at the genetic level and a differentiation of physiological functions with respect to age. Subjects and methods: Post-mortem transcripts of 30 individuals between the ages of 26 and 106 were used to estimate age-specific hazard rates for gene expression by taking into account duration information using multi-level survival data analysis. Results: Gene expression hazard rates were estimated, and combined longitudinally to produce a distribution of proportions of up- or down-regulated genes over age and function. Except for myelination/lipid metabolism, the stocks of up-regulated genes declined after 30 years of age. Conclusion: Combining data collected post-mortem with survival methods produces new estimates of the effects of age on gene expression. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.","Ageing; DNA; Interval censoring; Survival data analysis","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Down-Regulation; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Postmortem Changes; Proportional Hazards Models; Survival Analysis; Up-Regulation; age structure; aging population; brain; differentiation; DNA; gene expression; genetic analysis; metabolism; adult; aged; aging; article; biological model; cadaver; down regulation; frontal lobe; genetics; human; metabolism; middle aged; proportional hazards model; survival; upregulation","","","","","","","Abel L., Bonney G.E., A time-dependent logistic hazard function for modeling variable age of onset in analysis of familial diseases, Genet Epidemiol, 7, pp. 391-407, (1990); Bartzokis G., Lu P.H., Geschwind D.H., Edwards N., Mintz J., Cummings J.L., Apolipoprotein E genotype and age-related myelin breakdown in healthy individuals: Implications for cognitive decline and dementia, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 63, pp. 63-72, (2006); Bonneuil N., Clerget A., Clerget-Darpoux F., Variable age of onset in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by the marker-association-segregation- chi<sup>2</sup> method, Am J Hum Genet, 61, pp. 223-227, (1997); Cox D.R., Oakes D., Analysis of survival data, (1984); Gail M.H., Lubin J.H., Rubinstein L.V., Likelihood calculations for matched case-control studies and survival studies with tied death times, Biometrika, 68, pp. 703-707, (1981); Gilchrest B.A., Bohr V.A., The role of DNA damage and repair in cell ageing, (2001); Gorgas G., Butch E.R., Guan K.L., Miller R.A., Diminished activation of the MAP kinase pathway in CD3-stimulated T lymphocytes from mice, Mech Ageing Dev, 94, pp. 71-83, (1997); Klein J.A., Ackerman S.L., Oxidative stress, cell cycle, and neurodegeneration, J Clin Invest, 111, pp. 785-793, (2003); Li X., Greenwood A.F., Powers R., Jope R.S., Effects of postmortem interval, age, and Alzheimer's disease on G-proteins in human brain, Neurobiol Aging, 17, pp. 115-122, (1996); Lillard Lee A., Panis C.W.A., Upchurh D.M., Interdependencies over the life course: Women's fertility, marital, and educational experiences, (1996); Lu T., Pan Y., Kao S.-Y., Li C., Kohane I., Chan J., Yankner B., Gene regulation and DNA damage in the ageing human brain, Nature, 429, pp. 883-891, (2004); Mandell J.W., Banker G.A., The microtubule cytoskeleton and the development of neuronal polarity, Neurobiol Aging, 16, pp. 229-237, (1995); McKerrow J.H., Mechanisms of ageing and development.

First, the influence of that of marriages on the seasonality of births is highlighted, taking into account the different stages in women's reproductive lives and the presence of successive cohorts of unequal size. Second, the age-dependent and time-dependent monthly distribution of conception is disentangled from monthly marriage and birth time series by means of stochastic optimization under a Leslie recursion with time-varying and age-varying probability of conception. The application to Armenian-Gregorians in the Don Army Territory (South Russia) from 1889 to 1912 reveals strong consistency between reconstructed conception, mean age at marriage, and fertility time series.

Most emotions are classified by their memberships of viability sets, which in turn conceal the quantifiers ‘there exists’ (‘ (Formula presented.) ’) and ‘for all’ (‘ (Formula presented.) ’). Describing emotions in this way uses most of the concepts of viability theory, because emotions and viability sets both deal with survival and change. Emotion regulation mirrors mathematical controls, which can be operated in various ways, optimally or not, and that allow for improvement by learning. Application is to Maupassant’s A Woman’s Life, with viability kernels and capture basins succeeding each other in a description of the sequence of emotions felt by the heroine, and to a reappraisal of Laura and Petrarch’s emotional cycle. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","dynamic systems; emotion regulation; emotions; set-valued analysis; viability theory","Dynamical systems; Emotion regulations; emotions; Set valued analysis; Viability theory; Computer applications","","","","","","","Urry H.L., Using reappraisal to regulate unpleasant emotional episodes: goals and timing matter, Emotions, 9, pp. 782-797, (2009); Gross J.J., Antecedent- and response-focused emotion regulation: divergent consequences for experience, expression, and physiology, J.

This article uses Markov chain analysis to study the labour market transitions of South Korean women in different age groups. It shows the importance of differentiating the effects of contemporary labour market conditions, shaped by the forces of the moment, from conditions created by the institutional legacy of the past. Women's traditional position in the labour market has resulted in age-linked gendered precariousness, while the conditions of the moment are generating a tendency towards less precarious employment. Transition matrices are developed for types of precarious employment defined by the combination of job stability and job quality, taking into account duration by age group, time period, and covariates. These matrices yield distributions of asymptotic prevalence, reflecting labour market conditions of the moment. The forces of the moment favour the predominance of stable good-quality employment, whereas observed prevalence at a given date is characterised by the polarisation of the labour market between stable good-quality and unstable bad-quality employment. Asymptotic prevalence reveals a steady increase in stable but bad-quality employment. Older women are observed mostly in unstable bad-quality employment, but labour market conditions are tending to attenuate this age cleavage over time, as the conditions of the moment are reducing the proportions of older women in stable bad-quality and unstable good-quality employment. The conclusion is an age-based polarisation, in which older women are faring badly, but where possibilities are now opening up to younger South Korean women, reflected in the sharp break between the situation inherited from the past and the conditions of the moment. But possibilities for younger women will be realised only through a reinforcement of government policies to support career breaks and work-family balance through decent part-time jobs.

Among the many solutions fitting the data (which are not necessarily stable populations but which satisfy the demographic equations with time-varying fertility and mortality), the solution with the minimum variations in the demographic forces provides a useful reference. This solution is generally not a stable population, and it can be achieved with a technique borrowed from simulated annealing optimization. This method, although complex, produces a more realistic reconstruction of the underlying population than previous methods. Simulations show that the mean life expectancy at birth, the mean total fertility rate, and the mean population size over the deposition period are accurately reconstructed although the fluctuations of the corresponding time series are not.

The database is a representative follow-up of Korean respondents from 2006 to 2016. Satisfaction with quality of life is combined with endogenous consumption level, consumption patterns, deviation from expected mortality—the propensity for dying—, and wealth. Exogenous variables include sex, age, education, children, place of residence, and employment. Satisfaction decreases with age; women are less satisfied and anticipate higher mortality than men. Older people anticipate an age-specific mortality rate that increases only linearly with age, while mortality actually increases exponentially. This cognitive bias, due to the fact that people perceive linear progressions but find it difficult to project themselves over time, leads them to overestimate their satisfaction in terms of quality of life, thus creating a protective effect on well-being, to the detriment of accurate economic visibility of the life cycle. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","anticipated survival; Attitude to death; consumption profiles; mortality; satisfaction with quality of life; survival analysis","article; attitude to death; child; cognitive bias; education; employment; exogenous variable; female; follow up; human; life cycle; lifestyle; male; mortality rate; mortality risk; quality of life; satisfaction; survival analysis; visibility; wellbeing","","","","","","","Adams J., Stamp E., Daniel Nettle E.M., Milne G., Jagger C., Socioeconomic position and the association between anticipated and actual survival in older English adults, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 68, 9, pp. 818-825, (2014); Ahuvia A.C., If money doesn’t make us happy, why do we act as if it does?, Journal of Economic Psychology, 29, pp. 491-507, (2008); Baird B.M., Lucas R.E., Life satisfaction across the lifespan: Findings from two nationally representative panel studies, Social Indicators Research, 99, 2, pp. 183-203, (2010); Blanchflower D.G., Oswald A.J., Is well-being U-shaped over the life cycle?, Social Science & Medicine, 66, 8, pp. 1733-1749, (2008); Bonneuil N., (1997); Bonneuil N., Kim Y., Arbitrage between consumption and saving for bequest: the role of subjective expected survival and satisfaction with the quality of life, South Korea 2008-2014, Macroeconomic Dynamics, 25, 4, pp. 998-1019, (2021); Bruine de Bruin W., Parker A.M., Age differences in reported social networks and well-being, Psychology and Aging, 35, 2, pp. 159-168, (2020); Carstensen L.L., Fung H.H., Charles S.T., Socioemotional selectivity theory and the regulation of emotion in the second half of life, Motivation and Emotion, 27, 2, pp. 103-123, (2003); Carstensen L.L., Isaacowitz D.M., Charles S.T., Taking time seriously: A theory of socioemotional selectivity, American Psychologist, 54, 3, pp. 165-181, (1999); Cha E., Kim K., Effects of subjective health status on life satisfaction among middle-aged and aged people in Koreaâ€¯: Testing mediating effect of depression, Korean Journal of Gerontological Social Welfare, 70, pp. 53-80, (2015); Chamorro-Premuzic T., Confidence: The surprising truth about how much you need and how to get it, (2013); Clifford S., Costa S., Wakefield J.R.H., Kellezi B., Stack R.J., Family identification facilitates coping with financial stress: A social identity approach to family financial resilience, Journal of Economic Psychology, 78, (2020); Cooper J., Feldman L.A., Does cognitive dissonance occur in older age?

This relationship is revisited here from the perspective of optimal period school life expectancy, obtained from the utility maximization of the whole population characterized by its age structure and its age-specific fertility and mortality. Realistic life tables such as model life tables are mandatory, because the age distribution of mortality matters, notably at infant and juvenile ages. Optimal period school life expectancy varies with life expectancy and fertility. The application to French historical data from 1806 to nowadays shows that the population age structure has indeed modified the relationship between longevity and optimal schooling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Age structure; Longevity; School life expectancy; Schooling","","","","","","","","Aeberhardt R., Pouget J., Skalitz A., Le revenu salarial et ses composantes, évolution et inégalités de 1978 2005, (2007); Aubert P., Crepon B., Âge, salaire et productivité: la productivité des salariés décline-t-elle en fin de carrière?

The cleaner technology is adopted either instantaneously or gradually at a controlled rate. The problem of optimum under viability constraints is 6-dimensional under a continuous-discrete dynamic controlled by energy consumption and investment into production of renewable energy. Viable optima are obtained either with gradual or with instantaneous adoption. A longer time horizon increases the probability of adoption of renewable energy and the time for starting this adoption. It also increases maximal utility and the probability to cross the threshold of irreversible pollution. Exploiting a renewable energy starts sooner when adoption is gradual rather than instantaneous. The shorter the period remaining after adoption until the time horizon, the higher the investment into renewable energy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

Higher educated women were more likely to become inactive, but returned to work also more easily, especially when they added work experience. Being married, whether mother or not, induced a rearrangement of time between staying at home and labour, in rendering exit from employment more likely and return from inactivity to employment less likely. Exits from employment were less frequent for mothers of larger families, while return to employment decreased with the total number of children, in spite of the growing financial needs of larger families. Transitions between employment and inactivity increased with favourable economic conditions. However, involuntary exits from employment were more probable during economic downturns.","Female labour market transitions; Female life cycle; Multistate-multiepisode duration model; Retrospective survey","France; historical perspective; labor participation; life cycle; womens status","","","","","","","Adam P., Mothers in an insider-outsider economy: The puzzle of Spain, Journal of Population Economics, 9, 3, pp. 301-323, (1996); Atkinson A.B., Micklewright J., Unemployment compensation and labour market transitions: A critical review, Journal of Economic Literature, 29, pp. 1679-1727, (1991); Auriat N., Who forgets?

This has been a subject of controversy in the literature. The article presents a management method to overcome this possible dilemma, and reconcile conservation biology with economics. It is based on recent advances in the mathematical theory of dynamic systems under viability constraints. In the case of a one-locus two-allele plant coexisting with a one-locus two-allele parasite, the method provides a rule for deciding when and to what extent the resistant or the susceptible strain should be cultivated, in the uncertain time-varying presence of the parasite. This is useful for preventing the fixation of the susceptible allele—and thereby limiting the plant’s vulnerability in the medium term, should the parasite reappear. The method thus provides an aid to decision for economic and ecology-friendly profitability. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","C-viability; Genetic distance; Genetic diversity; Genetic resistance; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Aubin J.-P., Viability theory, (1991); Barrett J.A., Pathogen evolution in multilines and variety mixtures, Z Pflanzenk Pflanzens, 87, pp. 383-396, (1980); Beissinger S.R., McCullough D.R., Population viability analysis, (2002); Bonneuil N., Malthus, Boserup and population viability, Math Popul Stud, 4, 5, pp. 107-119, (1994); Bonneuil N., Capital accumulation, inertia of consumption and norms of reproduction, J Popul Econ, 7, pp. 49-62, (1994); Bonneuil N., Population paths implied by the mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences among mitochondrial DNA sequences, Ann Hum Genet, 62, pp. 61-73, (1998); Bonneuil N., Making ecosystem models viable, Bull Math Biol, 65, pp. 1081-1094, (2003); Bonneuil N., Computing the viability kernel in large state dimension, J Math Anal Appl, 323, 2, pp. 1444-1454, (2006); Bonneuil N., Diversity of preferences in an unpredictable environment, J Math Econ, 46, pp. 965-976, (2010); Bonneuil N., Multiallelic polymorphism maintained by unpredictable migration and selection, J Theor Biol, 293, pp. 189-196, (2012); Bonneuil N., Maximum under continuous–discrete-time dynamic with target and viability constraints, Optimization, 61, 8, pp. 901-913, (2012); Bonneuil N., Boucekkine R., Viable Ramsey economies, Can J Econ, 47, 2, pp. 421-444, (2014); Bonneuil N., Boucekkine R., Optimal transition to renewable energy with threshold of irreversible pollution, Eur J Oper Res, 248, pp. 257-262, (2016); Bonneuil N., Saint-Pierre P., Protected polymorphism in the two-locus haploid model with unpredictable fitnesses, J Math Biol, 40, 3, pp. 251-277, (2000); Bonneuil N., Saint-Pierre P., Minimal number of generations out of polymorphism in the one-locus two-allele model with unpredictable fertilities, J Math Biol, 44, 6, pp. 503-522, (2002); Brock W.A., Xepapadeas A., Valuing biodiversity from an economic perspective, a unified economic, ecological, and genetic approach, Am Econ Rev, 93, 5, pp. 1597-1614, (2003); Burdon J.J., Thrall P.H., The fitness costs to plants of resistance to pathogens, Genome Biol, 4, (2003); Edwards P.J., Abivardi C., The value of biodiversity: where ecology and economy blend, Biol Conserv, 83, 3, pp. 239-246, (1998); Gu Y.Q., Wildermuth M.C., Chakravarthy S., Loh Y.-T., Yang C., He X., Han Y., Martin G.B., Tomato transcription factors Pti4, Pti5, and Pti6 activate defense responses when expressed in Arabidopsis, Plant Cell, 14, pp. 817-831, (2002); Hastings A., Food web theory and stability, Ecology, 69, pp. 1665-1668, (1988); Heal G., Nature and the marketplace: capturing the value of ecosystem services, (2000); Henderson D.R., Present value.

Familial dependence is assessed through a multi-level hierarchical event-history analysis. The risks of migration must be differentiated by the distance of the move: short- and long-distance moves appear to be stimulated by different processes. No matter the distance of the move, no 'network' of sibling assistance emerges: none the less, the father's commune exerts a consistent pull and having an eldest sister at home or an eldest brother in a high-valued occupation increases the risk of migration of other siblings. A new birth, rather than the size of the family, tends to trigger moves. The young used to move more, often a few years after marriage. Literacy is associated with longer distance moves. The flow of migration increased over the century. Although no specific geographical pattern emerges, migration between cities dominated in terms of risk, while rural-to-urban migration developed slowly, but dominated in terms of volume.","","","","","","","","","Hagerstrand T., The propagation of innovation waves, Lund Studies in Geography, B-4, (1952); Hagerstrand T., Innovation Diffusion as a Spatial Process, (1967); Hagerstrand T., Migration and area.

In the one-locus two-allele model, level surfaces of this minimal time out of a given set K of constraints defining polymorphism are delineated. The surface of null minimal time is also the largest set of genotype frequencies from which there exists at least one route remaining in K forever. The influence of the range of admissible fertilities clarifies the trade-off between homozygotes and heterozygotes. Notably, ranges of fertility forbidding a system leaving K to ever return to it are determined. Generally, keeping a chance to regain polymorphism demands a sufficiently relatively high fertility for matings involving heterozygotes. © Springer-Verlag 2002.","Dynamical systems; Minimal time; One-locus two-allele; Protected polymorphism; Viability theory","Alleles; Animals; Computer Simulation; Fertility; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Genetic; Variation (Genetics); allele; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; fertility; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genetics","","","","","","","Aubin J.P., Viability Theory, (1991); Barker J.S.F., East P.D., Weir B.S., Temporal and microgeographic variation in allozyme frequencies in a natural population of Drosophila buzzatii, Genetics, 112, pp. 577-611, (1986); Barker J.S.F., East P.D., Evidence for selection following perturbation of allozyme frequencies in a natural population of Drosophila, Nature, 284, pp. 166-168, (1980); Bellman R., Dynamic Programming, (1957); Bebernes J.W., Schuur J.D., The Wazewski topological method for contingent equations, Annali di Matematica Pura et Applicata, 87, pp. 271-280; Bonneuil N., Mullers K., Viable populations in prey-predator systems, Journal of Mathematical Biology, 35, pp. 261-293, (1997); Bonneuil N., Population paths implied by the mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences among mitochondrial sequences, Annals of Human Genetics, 62, pp. 61-73, (1998); Bonneuil N., Saint-Pierre P., Protected polymorphism in the two-locus haploid model with uncertain fitnesses, Journal of Mathematical Biology, 40, pp. 251-277, (2000); Cardaliaguet P., Quincampoix M., Saint-Pierre P., Temps minimal pour des problèmes de contrôle avec contraintes et sans contrôllabillité, C.R.

Not any trajectory is successful, but those which are successful are myriad. Agents' heterogeneity is modelled both by the whole state space where each state corresponds to a different situation, and by the set of attainable states, which reflects uncertainty inherent both in decision-making and in external shocks. The delineation of all manageable states of consumption, reproduction, and saving identifies the timing of when to have children, and when and how much to consume and save. Discontinuities of consumption when a child is born are fully taken into account through continuous-discrete differential inclusions. The theory is illustrated with an empirical example; international comparison shows that lower fertility is associated with smaller sets of timely decisions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In rural areas, population growth and the scarcity of good land undermined the Orthodox tradition, though it was defended by the Church; rural Armenian-Gregorians persisted in early marriage, unlike Old Believers, Buddhists, and Lutherans. In cities, Armenian-Gregorians and Jews, unlike Catholics, adopted late marriage. Age at marriage among Orthodox was slightly later in cities and their hinterlands, against the tradition that Church conservatism favored. The different trajectories of nuptiality reveal a struggle between religion, economics, and urban life, making nuptiality a scene of contradictory influences. © 2022 The Author(s).","age at marriage; age difference between bride and groom; nuptiality transition; religions; time series","","","","","","","","","N.

The Pontryagin procedure allows the analytical expression of the Nash equilibria for two populations sharing a common resource and capable of growth. An alternative procedure, which avoids solving differential equations and inherently includes state constraints, involves building the capture-viability kernel of an auxiliary system. For two populations, all Nash equilibria under state constraints are obtained as the intersection of the boundaries of two capture-viability kernels. The two methods, Pontryagin and viability, yield concordant results. Viability is more flexible and avoids solving differential equations for each initial condition. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Economics of the commons; Nash equilibria; Optimal control; Population growth; Viability theory","Economics; Equations of state; Population statistics; Analytical expressions; Birth rates; Common resources; Economic of the common; Nash equilibria; Optimal controls; Population growth; Population sizes; State constraints; Viability theory; Differential equations","","","","","","","Hardin G., The tragedy of the commons, Science, 162, 3859, pp. 1243-1248, (1968); Hardin G., The tragedy of the unmanaged commons, Trends Ecol.

They involve coverable means. A two-stage Heckman estimation coupled with endogenous regressions of coverable means and subjective health applied to the Korean Longitudinal Study on Aging, 2006-2020, shows that the deficit is likely when family heads are elderly or women, unemployed, with children, living in apartments, with dependants, with housing expenses, or dependent on transfers from parents. These heads take longer to overcome a deficit, whatever the choice of coverable means. People who use bank loans are employed, healthy, and live in a metropolis. Unexpected health expenses (not covered by insurance) drive people to use a means of coverage, which challenges the permanent income hypothesis and risk management theory. Extending national health insurance to chronic diseases, protecting precarious jobs, subsidizing caregivers, microcredit, encouraging family solidarity, or reconciling work and family are avenues for reform. © 2023 The Association for Social Economics.","Family economics; health expenditures; longitudinal follow-up; welfare","","","","","","","","Anderloni L., Bacchiocchi E., Vandone D., Household financial vulnerability: An empirical analysis, Research in Economics, 66, 3, pp. 284-296, (2012); Angel R.J., Frisco M., Angel J.L., Chiriboga D.A., Financial strain and health among elderly Mexican-origin individuals, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 44, 4, pp. 536-551, (2003); Baek E., Hong G.-S., Effects of family life-cycle stages on consumer debts, Journal of Family and Economic Issues, 25, 3, pp. 359-385, (2004); Baek E., DeVaney S.A., How do families manage their economic hardship?, Family Relations, 59, 4, pp. 358-368, (2010); policy report, (2021); Blom N., Kraaykamp G., Verbakel E., Current and expected economic hardship and satisfaction with family life in Europe, Journal of Family Issues, 40, 1, pp. 3-32, (2019); Bonneuil N., Early warning to insolvency in the pension fund: The French case, Risks, 1, 1, pp. 1-13, (2013); Bonneuil N., Kim Y., Precarious employment among South Korean women: Is inequality changing with time?, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 28, 1, pp. 20-40, (2017); Bonneuil N., Kim Y., Socio-economic and health determinants of transitions to adult dependency in South Korea, 2008–2014, Public Health, 173, pp. 130-137, (2019); Canner G.B., Kennickell A.B., Luckett C.A., Household sector borrowing and the burden of debt, Federal Reserve Bulletin, Apr, pp. 323-338, (1995); Carroll C.D., Buffer-stock saving and the life cycle/permanent income hypothesis, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 112, 1, pp. 1-55, (1997); Castellani G., DeVaney S.A., Using credit to cover living expenses: A profile of a potentially risky behavior, Family Economics and Nutrition Review, 13, 2, (2001); Chang M., A poverty solution of low-income elderly women in Korea and their life conditions, Health and Welfare Policy Forum, pp. (12), 18-27, (2013); Chant S., Dangerous equations?

They affect censuses and, consequently, rates involving numbers by age. As their analytical expression becomes inextricable, a simulation of aging cohorts by months of age shows that mortality oscillations for human populations are not sufficient to prevent age classes from oscillating approximately like associated births, contrary to what previous literature suggests. The amplification converges after damping, and the level reached depends on the amplification of mortality oscillations relative to births between 0 and 6 months of age. The damping rate depends mainly on the amplification of the mortality of 0–5 months compared to births. The application to 1896 South Russian data shows that age class sizes vary during the year like the births of the associated cohorts and that the numbers counted at the census vary strongly according to the month of the census. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.","Census; Fourier series; Leslie matrix; seasonality of births; seasonality of mortality","Russian Federation; age; census; damping; demographic survey; demographic trend; Fourier transform; mortality; oscillation; seasonal variation","","","","","","","The 1897 Census of the Russian Empire (1905) the Don Army Territory, 12, pp. 160-165; Aaby P., Severity of measles and cross-sex transmission of infection in Copenhagen,1915–1925, International Journal of Epidemiology, 1991, 20, pp. 504-507, (1975); Bonneuil N., Turbulent dynamics in a 17th century population, Mathematical Population Studies, 2, 4, pp. 289-311, (1990); Bonneuil N., Transformation of the French Demographic Landscape, (1997); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Optimal population path fitting for flawed vital statistics and censuses, Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 148, 2, pp. 301-317, (2011); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Optimal marriage fitting for imperfect statistics, Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 153, pp. 532-545, (2012); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Secularization and confessional components of the seasonality of marriage in South Russia, 1867–1916, Continuity and Change, 28, 1, pp. 51-88, (2013); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Learning hygiene: mortality patterns by religion in the Don Army Territory (South Russia), 1867–1916, Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 47, 3, pp. 287-332, (2017); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Optimal seasonality of conception inferred from marriage and birth time series in populations with no contraception, Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences, 41, 3, pp. 1125-1135, (2018); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Seasonal components of infant mortality at the onset of the transition reveal the role of water-borne and air-borne diseases: the case of the Don Army Territory (South Russia), 1872–1915, Historical Methods, 54, 1, pp. 44-62, (2021); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Nuptiality to regulate the commons?

Informal caregiving is examined in South Korea using longitudinal data. The results are that women with a dependent disengage more from caregiving than men; caregivers are young rather than old, and more frequently live in rural areas. They receive more financial transfers from non-cohabiting relatives and have fewer children than non-caregivers with a dependent adult. Both caregivers and non-caregivers are less likely than those without a dependent adult to give money to non-cohabiting relatives. Educational level does not influence the probability of having a dependent relative or, among people with a dependent, of being a caregiver. Among people with a dependent adult, wage earners are more likely to provide care than the unemployed. The time spent in caregiving depends more on the dependent’s demand than on the caregiver’s capacity to provide support. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ageing; Caregiving; dependence; Heckman regression; South Korea","South Korea; adult; aging; educational attainment; elderly care; regression analysis; rural area; welfare provision","","","","","Université catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve; FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions; European Commission, EC; UniversitÃ© Pierre et Marie Curie, UPMC","Funding text 1: This study is supported by the ‘MOVE-IN Louvain’ project of Université catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve, co-funded by the Marie Curie Actions of the European Commission. ; Funding text 2: This study is supported by ?MOVE-IN Louvain? project of Universit? catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve, co-funded by the Marie Curie Actions of the European Commission.

For the population of an enterprise with high labour turnover: frequent changes in function, levels of qualification, seniority, type of activity, where arrivals and departures occur daily, the calculation of key elements, such as the ACS, affecting the total wage cost, becomes difficult. For this reason, a computerized solution has been developed. It is based on a general formulation which expands on the methods presently in use. This article presents results obtained from a combination of the practical needs of personnel management and a theoretical analysis of the dynamics involved in the costs associated with shifts in the workforce within an enterprise. -English summary","","employment structure; labour force demography; population mobility; theoretical analysis; wage bill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","French","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024830157"

It makes it possible to view the sometimes banal reality of population figures in a different light. It can establish new links, launch out into unexpected directions, associate phenomena which would a priori seem remote from one another. By discerning common structures, it can strengthen the conceptual foundations on which demography is built, and by opening up new paths of investigation, it can stimulate our imagination. Following recent studies in the fields of vector topology and catastrophe theory, the author shows how new ways of representing changes in fertility can reveal the existence of distinct fertility regimes (""attractors') between which the population can move rapidly. -Journal summary","","fertility behaviour; population characteristics; structural factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025528277"

Short-term errors in the commitment for retirement benefits, ill-suited investment in the stock market, or improper mixture with pay-as-you-go payments have long-term consequences and may lead the pension fund to insolvency. The differential equation governing the current assets shows the respective weights associated with the error on the interest rate, the error on the extra bonus, and the error made in forecasting mortality. These weights are estimated through simulations. A short follow-up is sufficient to estimate the three errors. A threshold for the extra interest rate to be earned on the financial market is given to counter-balance the extra bonus when mortality is forecast correctly. © 2013 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Control differential equation; Mis-estimation of mortality; Pension funding; Retirement benefits","","","","","","","","Bowers N.L., Hickman J.C., Nesbitt C.J., Introduction to the dynamics of pension funding, Transactions of the Society of Actuaries, 28, pp. 177-203, (1976); Réglement Et Choix De Portefeuille Des Fonds De Pension, pp. 129-143, (2000); Blake D., Pension schemes as options on pension fund assets: Implications for pension fund management, Insur.

Is the search for asymptotic patterns appropriate for modelling maintenance and acquisition? In biology, where variability and surprise prevail, moment-by-moment time, not limit sets, matters. Taking the state of a particular system at a particular moment into account requires the substitution and replacement of many of the concepts usual to asymptotic analysis: the replacement of probability by set membership; the replacement of trajectories by attainable sets; the replacement of limit sets by the C-viability kernel or capture domain. Rather than convergence to an attractor and dominance of an optimal or evolutionary stable strategy, the focus here is on identifying the right strategy at the right moment that allows a living system to have at least some possibility of perpetuation or collapse. Basic models of ecosystem and population genetics are revisited from this perspective. Notably, rather than proposing a mechanism and examining how it behaves under various constraints, here the constraints are incorporated in the dynamic system from the start through C-viability multipliers. Case studies reveal that even without using the theoretical tools of C-viability, some experimenters have empirically invoked C-viability multipliers or explored C-viability domains. © 2008 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this article, however, it is suggested that what is involved is less equilibria than viability. The main aim of Basseri nomads is to be able to stay on their lands, while for Norwegian fishermen it is to find fish. To achieve this result, each actor has a certain freedom of action that they must use in the right way at the right time. In an environment characterized by uncertainty and constraints, the individuals can operate the controls through which the systems can perpetuate themselves. The exact future of a system cannot be predicted, but it is possible to identify the largest set of states from which there is at least one possibility of remaining within the constraints and thus of surviving. It is the law of regulation which provides the set of viable controls for each state. Other applications of viability theory in demography are presented in appendices. These concern fluctuations in fertility, the Malthus-Boserup dynamic between population and resources, the relationship between predator-prey populations, and the research for the population paths which could have produced the present genetic heterogeneity.","","","","","","","","","Allen P.M., Mc Glade J.M., Dynamics of discovery and exploitation: The case of the Scotian groundfish fisheries, Can.

In times of population growth and limited resources, economic sustainability then requires that age of marriage should be raised. In the case study of the Don Cossacks, 1867-1916, early marriage, which was an important marker of social cohesion, was too slow to increase when mortality declined, fuelling a population growth that threatened the agrarian economy: age at marriage then appears to be essential to the theory of the commons in traditional societies.  © 2020 Oxford University Press 2020.

The pioneering construction of graphic derivatives of set-valued maps renews the understanding of dynamic level sets in social science. The exemplary case of schooling in 19th-century France shows the set derivatives of level sets and illustrates how the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 disturbed the directions taken in 1867. A comparison of the observed changes of level sets with those observed under rational theoretical policies leads to the conclusion that the actors behaved with the ambition of optimizing the overall schooling incidence while reducing the gap between boys and girls. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","dynamical systems; France; mutational equations; schooling","","","","","","","","Aubin J.-P., Mutational and morphological analysis: Tools for shape regulation and morphogenesis, (1999); Bartholomew D.J., Stochastic models for social processes, (1982); Bayley N.T., The mathematical theory of infectious diseases and applications, (1976); Bonneuil N., Transformation of the French demographic landscape, 1806-1906, (1997); Bonneuil N., The mathematics of time in history, History and Theory, 49, pp. 27-45, (2010); Bonneuil N., Bringe A., Rosental P.-A., Familial components of first migrations after marriage in nineteenth century France, Social History, 33, pp. 36-59, (2008); Bonneuil N., Dassouki C., Women's education and diffusion of the fertility transition: The case of Egypt 1960-1996 in 4905 administrative subdivisions, Journal of Population Research, 23, pp. 27-39, (2006); Bonneuil N., Dassouki C., Economics, geography, family planning and rapidity of change in the demographic transition: The case of the Egyptian Muhafazas 1960-1996, Journal of Developing Areas, 40, pp. 185-210, (2007); Bonneuil N., Rosental P.-A., Changing social mobility in 19th century France, Historical Methods, 32, pp. 53-73, (1999); Cea J., Problems of shape optimal design, Optimization of distributed parameter structures, pp. 1005-1048, (1981); Coleman J.S., Katz E., Menzel H., Medical innovation, (1966); DeBats D.A., A tale of two cities, Historical Methods, 41, pp. 17-38, (2008); Diebolt C., Les effectifs scolarisés en France: XIXe et XXe siècles, International Review of Education, 45, pp. 197-213, (1999); Diekman A., Diffusion and survival models for the process of entry into marriage, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 14, pp. 31-44, (1989); Flint C., The theoretical and methodological utility of space and spatial statistics for historical studies, Historical Methods, 35, pp. 32-42, (2002); Gastner M.T., Newman M.E.J., Diffusion-based method for producing density equalizing maps, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 101, pp. 7499-7504, (2004); Gorre A., Evolution of operable tubes under operability constraints, Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 216, pp. 1-22, (1997); Gregory I., Ell P.S., Analyzing spatio-temporal change by use of national historical geographical information systems, Historical Methods, 35, pp. 149-167, (2005); Grew R., Harrigan P., School, state, and society.

During the warmer months, they were lower in cities. Summer heat had a lethal effect, mitigated by precipitation; illegitimate infants were exposed to the change of season; high winds increased mortality in late winter for 0–5 month infants and in summer for 6–11 month infants in cities. By the turn of the century, mortality had decreased, thanks to the gradual purification of water supplies and improved health practices. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Infant mortality; mortality transition; seasonality","Russian Federation; demographic history; infant mortality; respiratory disease; seasonal variation; statistical analysis; waterborne disease","","","","","","","Akima H., A new method of interpolation and smooth curve fitting based on local procedures, Journal of the ACM (JACM), 17, 4, pp. 589-602, (1970); Avdeev A., (2002); Avdeev A.A., Blumtroitskaya I., The seasonal factor in the demography of the Russian peasantry in the first half of the 19th century: Marriage, fertility, infant mortality, Russian Demographic Review, 1, 6, pp. 35-45, (2002); Berelovich W., La Russie, Histoire de la population de l’Europe, (1998); Bernhardt E., Crowding and child survival in Stockholm 1895-1920, Demography, Economy and Welfare, pp. 279-291, (1995); Bonneuil N., Transformation of the French Demographic Landscape, pp. 1806-1906, (1997); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Optimal population path fitting for flawed vital statistics and censuses, Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 148, 2, pp. 301-317, (2011); Bonneuilfursa N.E., Learning hygiene: Mortality patterns by religion in the Don Army Territory (Southern Russia), 1867-1916, Journal of Interdisciplinary History XLVII, 3, pp. 287-332, (2017); Bonneuil N., Fursa E., Optimal seasonality of conception inferred from marriage and birth time series in populations with no contraception, Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences, 41, 3, pp. 1125-1135, (2018); Breschilivi-Bacci M.M., Le mois de naissance comme facteur de survie des enfants, Annales De démographie Historique, 1994, 1, pp. 169-185, (1994); Cain L., Hong S.C., Survival in 19th century cities: The larger the city, the smaller your chances, Explorations in Economic History, 46, 4, pp. 450-463, (2009); Coale A.J., The decline of fertility in Europe from the French revolution to World War II, Fertility and Family Planning: A World View, pp. 3-24, (1969); Calotcaselli G.G., Détermination d’une table de mortalité: La conversion des taux en quotients, Population, 46, 6, pp. 1441-1490, (1991); Carder M., R., McNamee, I., Beverland, R., Elton, G.

These principles stem from deep mathematical grounds of dynamic systems and sets, and are formalized in viability theory. They characterize the diversity of human behavior and the inherent unpredictability of historical situations. Major themes in the political economy of populations are revisited from this perspective: fertility fluctuations and endogenous growth, the relationships between population growth, resources, and economic progress, the demographic transition and its link to economic factors, economics of the family and the life cycle, financing an aging society, inter-generational equity, social networks, industrial economics, and the economic value of biodiversity. © Dalloz.

Minimizing the cost to constraints lets us determine whether a given state is T-viable or not, and this is implementable in large dimension for the state-space. Minimizing on the initial condition itself lets find viable states. Quincampoix's semi-permeability property helps find other states located close to the viability boundary, which is then gradually delineated. The algorithm is particularly suited to the identification of specific trajectories, such as the heavy viable solution, or to the computation of viability kernels associated with delayed dynamics. The volume of the viability kernel and its confidence interval can be estimated by randomly drawing states and checking their viability status. Examples are given. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Stricto sensu, the maintenance of polymorphism is identified with the set of states, called the C-viability kernel, from which there exists at least one trajectory remaining in the set of constraints. Protected polymorphism under time-dependent selection and migration is re-formulated as a C-viability problem. The C-viability kernel is computed under conditions of time-dependent unpredictable migration and selection, from the case of two demes and two alleles up to that of three demes and three alleles. It delineates the trade-off between isolation and openness to migration combined with relative fitness values. The problem of protected polymorphism in time-varying conditions is then answered in its full dimensionality. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","C-Viability; Dynamical systems; High dimension; Protected polymorphism; Subdivided populations","Algorithms; Alleles; Animals; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Genetic; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; allele; fitness; migration; natural selection; polymorphism; time dependent behavior; article; gene frequency; genetic algorithm; genetic linkage; genetic model; genetic parameters; genetic polymorphism; genetic selection; genetic variability; kernel method; mathematical computing; migration; molecular dynamics; population biology; population genetics; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; time series analysis","","","","","","","Aubin J.P., Viability Theory, (1991); Barker J.S.F., East P.D., Weir B.S., Temporal and microgeographic variation in allozyme frequencies in a natural population of Drosophila buzzatii, Genetics, 112, pp. 577-611, (1986); Bonneuil N., Population paths implied by the mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences among mitochondrial sequences, Ann.

This diversity comes first from the strong association between mobilization, slight discrimination, migration distress, religion and repression. On a finer detail, discrimination appears to be associated with resistance if it is related to land and power, with war if it concerns social mobility, or with insurgency if it has to do with social customs. Migration from rural to urban and abroad is accompanied by high mobilization and rioting or war when social mobility is at stake. Declining state power and democratization can open the door to violent action. Finally, there is also international diffusion of protest. Locating minority groups in this landscape of correspondence helps to compare and characterize the various particular histories. These range from Lebanon's period of war, or the years of insurgency in Iran or Somalia, to the mixture of verbal opposition and terrorism in Western democracies. Crystallizing protest in India or China is differentiated against the deterioriation of group coherence in the Middle East; sporadic bursts of violence in Africa are contrasted against insurgency and rioting in East and Southeast Asia. The results point to the need for conflict prevention policies to pay more attention to the promotion of equitable social mobility.","","","","","","","","","Abbott A., The Causal Devolution, Sociological Methods and Research, 27, 2, pp. 148-181, (1998); Aminzade R., Ballots and Barricades: Class Formation and Republican Politics in France, 1830-1871, (1993); Anderson B., Imagined Communities, 2nd Edn., (1991); Barkey K., Parikh S., Comparative Perspectives on the State, Annual Review of Sociology, 17, pp. 523-549, (1991); Bates R.H., Modernization, Ethnic Competition, and the Rationality of Politics in Contemporary Africa, State Versus Ethnic Claims: African Policy Dilemmas, pp. 152-172, (1983); Benzecri J.-P., Correspondence Analysis Handbook, (1992); Bonneuil N., Rosental P.-A., Changing Social Mobility in 19th Century France, Historical Methods, 32, 2, pp. 53-73, (1999); Bry X., Analyses Factorielles Multiples [Multiple Factor Analyses], (1996); Burguiere A., La déstabilisation de la société française, Histoire de la Population Française [History of the French Population], 2, pp. 475-493, (1991); Cibois P., Les pièges de lanalyse des correspondances, Histoire et Mesure, Special Issue, 'Penser et Mesurer la Structure' [Thinking and Measuring Structure], 12, 3-4, pp. 299-320, (1997); Elster J., Alchemies of the Mind, (1999); Fearon J.D., Laitin D.D., Explaining Interethnic Cooperation, American Political Science Review, 90, 4, pp. 715-735, (1996); Fisher Ronald J., Toward a Social-psychological Model of Intergroup Conflict, Conflict and Social Psychology, pp. 109-112, (1993); Fox J., The Influence of Religious Legitimacy on Grievance Formation by Ethnoreligious Minorities, Journal of Peace Research, 36, 3, pp. 289-307, (1999); Fox J., Do Religious Institutions Support Violence or the Status Quo?, Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 22, 2, pp. 119-139, (1999); Franzosi R., Mobilization and Counter-Mobilization Processes: From the ""Red Years"" (1919-1920) to the ""Black Years"" (1921-1922) in Italy, Theory and Society, 26, 2-3, pp. 275-304, (1997); Franzosi R., Narrative Analysis - Or Why (and How) Sociologists Should be Interested in Narrative, Annual Review of Sociology, 24, pp. 517-554, (1998); Franzosi R., Mohr J.W., New Directions in Formalization and Historical Analysis, Theory and Society, 26, 2-3, pp. 133-160, (1997); Geertz C., The Interpretation of Cultures, 2nd Edn., (1993); Greenacre M., The Theory and Application of Correspondence Analysis, (1984); Gurr T.R., Minorities at Risk: A Global View of Ethnopolitical Conflicts, (1993); Gurr T.R., Why Minorities Rebel: A Global Analysis of Communal Mobilization and Conflict since 1945, International Political Science Review, 14, 2, pp. 161-201, (1993); Gurr T.R., Peoples against States: Ethnopolitical Conflict and the Changing World System, International Studies Quaterly, 38, pp. 347-377, (1994); Gurr T.R., Ethnopolitical Rebellion: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the 1980s with Risk Assessments for the 1990s, American Journal of Political Science, 41, 4, pp. 1079-1103, (1997); Gurr T.R., Moore W.H., Ethnopolitical Rebellion: A Cross-sectional Analysis of the 1980s with Risk Assessment for the 1990s, American Journal of Political Science, 41, 4, pp. 1079-1103, (1997); Hardin R., One for All: The Logic of Group Conflict, (1995); Hobsbawm E.J., 'Nations and Nationalism since 1789: Programme, Myth, Reality', 5th Edn., (1990); Jaggers K., Gurr T.R., Tracking Democracys Third Wave with the Polity III Data, Journal of Peace Research, 32, 4, pp. 469-482, (1995); Lebart L., Salem A., Berry L., Exploring Textual Data, (1998); Litvinoff M., Et al., World Directory of Minorities, (1997); Mahoney J., Nominal, Ordinal, and Narrative Appraisal in Macrocausal Analysis, American Journal of Sociology, 104, 4, pp. 1154-1196, (1999); Des Netumieres F., Méthodes de régression et analyse factorielle, Histoire et Mesure, Special Issue 'Penser et Mesurer la Structure' [Thinking and Measuring Structure], 12, 3-4, pp. 271-298, (1997); Schaeffer R., Warpaths, Politics of Partition, (1990); Skocpol T., States and Social Revolutions, (1979); Stavenhagen R., The Ethnic Question: Conflicts, Development, and Human Rights, (1990); Thompson E.P., Customs in Common, (1991); Tilly C., From Mobilization to Revolution, (1978); Tilly C., To Explain Political Processes, American Journal of Sociology, 100, 6, pp. 1594-1610, (1995); Tilly C., James S.

In a variable environment, however, the coexistence of varying preferences no longer requires optimality, but is identified with the mathematical property of viability: a state of the population is viable if there exists at least one solution starting from it and remaining in the set of constraints until a given time horizon (or forever).The coexistence kernel of two competitors with varying preferences is computed for the case of scalar and 2 × 2 Leslie matrices, with either measurable or differentiable preferences. The homologue of indifference curves is the regulation map, the correspondence associating the set of viable preferences to a given state of the population.Among these viable trajectories, some are also optimal in the sense of dominance discounted in time. These viable optimal solutions are obtained as specific trajectories in an auxiliary dynamic system, and the associated maximal values constitute one boundary of the viability kernel of this auxiliary system (theorem). Hence, the perpetuation of varying preferences allows the diversity of economic preferences, as shown here using the example of the comparative history of fertility from mid-nineteenth century to nowadays in France and England. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Birth fluctuations; Discrete time; Leslie matrix; Preferences; Viability theory","","","","","","","","Aubin J.-P., Dynamic Economic Theory: A Viability Approach, (1997); Bonneuil N., Contextual and structural factors in fertility behavior, Population English Version, pp. 69-92, (1990); Bonneuil N., Turbulent dynamics in a 17th century population, Mathematical Population Studies, 2, 4, pp. 289-311, (1990); Bonneuil N., Capital accumulation, inertia of consumption and norms of reproduction, Journal of Population Economics, 7, pp. 49-62, (1994); Bonneuil N., Transformation of the French Demographic Landscape, 1806-1906, (1994); Bonneuil N., Computing the viability kernel in large state dimension, Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 323, 2, pp. 1444-1454, (2006); Bonneuil N., Saint-Pierre P., Beyond optimality: managing children, assets, and consumption over the life cycle, Journal of Mathematical Economics, 44, 3-4, pp. 227-241, (2008); Cannarsa P., Frankowska H., Some characterizations of optimal trajectories in control theory, SIAM Journal of Control and Optimization, 29, pp. 1322-1347, (1991); Hansson I., Stuart C., Malthusian selection of preferences, The American Economic Review, 80, 3, pp. 529-544, (1990); Hastings A., Food web theory and stability, Ecology, 69, pp. 1665-1668, (1988); Law R., Morton D., Permanence and the assembly of ecological communities, Ecology, 77, 3, pp. 762-775, (1996); Nagumo M., Über die Lage der integralkurven gewöhnlicher Differentialgleichungen, Proceedings of the Physical and Mathematical Society of Japan, 24, pp. 551-559, (1942); Robson A.J., Samuelson L., The evolution of intertemporal preferences, The American Economic Review, pp. 496-500, (2007); Rogers A.R., Evolution of time preferences by natural selection, The American Economic Review, 84, 3, pp. 460-481, (1994); Saint-Pierre P., Approximation of the viability kernel, Applied Mathematics and Optimisation, 29, pp. 187-209, (1994); Vincent T.L., Brown J.S., Evolution under nonequilibrium dynamics, Mathematical Modelling in Science and Technology, 8, pp. 766-771, (1986); Williamson M., Are communities ever stable?, Colonization, Succession and Stability, pp. 353-371, (1987); Wrigley E.A., Schofield R.S., The Population History of England 1541-1871.

The Ramsey model, augmented with minimal consumption and sustainability criteria, becomes a viability problem. The framework allows for a clear picture of optimal viable, optimal non-viable, and viable non-optimal paths.

The econometric analysis of viability sets enhances the role of technological progress in ensuring Brundtland sustainability.

Specific aspects of these theories are presented in several different areas to show their concrete applications in history and historical demo-economy, and a parallel is established with novelist Tanizaki's fictional technique. In connection with this, McCloskey's 1991 comparison of storytelling with deterministic chaos is discussed and a critique of other models concerned with unpredictability in human affairs provided. Finally, the shapings of social and historical time are described in terms of the viable strategies at the heart of evolutionary processes involving human agents interacting with a variety of constraints.

If on the other hand she married Itakura, she would be held up to public ridicule.

The set of those which do is here delineated (the viability kernel tube), and the operations at any time necessary to control trajectories so as they remain in this set are identified (the regulation map).

Instead of imposing a univocal relationship between population pressure and level of knowledge, the way technology will change is not determined, it is only constrained. This leads to regard any situation as associated to a set of reachable futures. When no possibility is left for systems to avoid extinction, systems are no longer viable. Hence, the control-phase space can be divided into regions corresponding to gradual danger or security. This point of view allows the introduction of ideas such as incentives to create or to use new knowledge, gives a role to the threatening power of Malthusian checks and leaves space for a specific variety of behaviors. The Boserupian theme then appears indirectly, emerging from the constraints imposed by the inertia of technological change. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Study design: The Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging, 2006–2014. Methods: The transitions between non-dependence and difficulties in activities of daily living —instrumental (IADL) or not (ADL)—are distinguished between stability, deterioration, death, or recovery in multilevel logistic regressions. Results: Controlling for other covariates, women are more likely to remain without difficulty than men, dependants are more likely out of the labor force or unemployed, city dwellers are more likely dependent. Subjective health helps predict health two years later, as grip power, score of cognition, depression, cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases, and the number of difficulties in IADL (but not in ADL). Dependants with difficulties in IADL reporting no caregiver survive longer but are less likely to recover. Difficulties in ADL overwhelm any other available determinant. The Gompertz-like increase in the death rate with age no longer holds true for ADL dependants. Cardiac and cerebrovascular pathologies and smoking and drinking favor the transition to disability. Conclusions: Socio-economic and medical factors identify a multifactorial determination of the risk to dependence and changes in dependence status, controlling for each effect and selection bias. © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health","Aging; Difficulties in activities of daily living; Mortality at old age; Multilevel logistic model; Transitions to dependency","Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Health Status; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; South Korea; adult; aging; elderly care; health risk; logistics; longitudinal gradient; mortality; public health; socioeconomic conditions; adult; age; aged; Article; caregiver; cerebrovascular disease; cognition; controlled study; daily life activity; death; dependence living; depression; deterioration; disability; drinking; employment; female; grip strength; heart disease; human; human activities; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; scoring system; sex difference; smoking; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; South Korea; survival rate; unemployment; urban population; daily life activity; health status; middle aged; socioeconomics; very elderly","","","","","FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions; Marie Curie; European Commission, EC; Université Catholique de Louvain, UCL","Funding text 1: This study is supported by 'MOVE-IN Louvain’ project of Université catholique de Louvain , cofunded by the Marie Curie Actions of the European Commission. ; Funding text 2: This study is supported by 'MOVE-IN Louvain’ project of Université catholique de Louvain, cofunded by the Marie Curie Actions of the European Commission.","Nakazawa A., Nakamura K., Kitamura K., Yoshizawa Y., Association between activities of daily living and mortality among institutionalized elderly adults in Japan, J Epidemiol, 22, 6, pp. 501-507, (2012); Hardy S.E., Allore H.G., Guo Z., Gill T.M., Explaining the effect of gender on functional transitions in older persons, Gerontology, 54, 2, pp. 79-86, (2008); van Houwelingen A.H., Cameron I.D., Gussekloo J., Putter H., Kurrle S., Craen A.J.M., de), Blom J.W., Disability transitions in the oldest old in the general population.

Such a set is calculated in the two-locus haploid model, as well as the corresponding fitnesses at any time which make this maintenance possible. The dependence of the C-viability kernel on the set U of admissible fitnesses and on the recombination rate r is studied. Notably, the C-viability kernel varies rapidly in the neighborhood of equal fitness of AB and ab; it becomes empty when ab has a fitness below a certain function, which is delineated, of the recombination rate. The properties of the two-locus model under constraints, out of equilibrium and with unpredictable selection are thus presented. © Springer-Verlag 2000.","Protected polymorphism; Two-locus two alleles; Viability theory","Alleles; Animals; Computer Simulation; Genotype; Haplotypes; Humans; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Genetic; allele; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genotype; haplotype; human","","","","","","","Allard R.W., Genetic changes associated with the evolution of adaptedness in cultivated plants and their wild progenitors, Journal of Heredity, 79, pp. 225-238, (1988); Aubin J.P., Viability Theory, (1991); Barker J.S.F., East P.D., Weir B.S., Temporal and microgeographic variation in allozyme frequencies in a natural population of Drosophila buzzatii, Genetics, 112, pp. 577-611, (1986); Bonneuil N., Population paths implied by the mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences among mitochondrial sequences, Annals of Human Genetics, 62, pp. 61-73, (1998); Bonneuil N., Mullers K., Viable populations in prey-predator systems, Journal of Mathematical Biology, 35, pp. 261-293, (1997); Doebeli M., De Jong G., A simple genetic model with non-equilibrium dynamics, Journal of Mathematical Biology, 36, pp. 550-556, (1998); Ewens W.J., Mathematical Population Genetics, (1979); Christiansen F.B., Feldman M.W., Subdivided populations: A review of the oneand two-locus deterministic theory, Theoretical Population Biology, 7, pp. 13-38, (1975); Doyen L., Saint-Pierre P., Scale of viability and minimal time of crisis, Set-Valued Analysis, 5, pp. 227-246, (1997); Feldman M.W., Equilibrium studies of two-locus haploid populations with recombination, Theoretical Population Biology, 2, pp. 299-318, (1971); Felsenstein J., The effect of linkage on directional selection, Genetics, 52, pp. 349-363, (1965); Fox G.A., Hastings A., Inferring selective history from multilocus frequency data: Wright meets the Hamiltonian, Genetics, 132, pp. 277-288, (1992); Garcia-Martinez J., Castro J.A., Ramon M., Latorre A., Moya A., Mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies in natural and experimental populations of Drosophila subobscura, Genetics, 149, pp. 1377-1382, (1998); Gavrilets S., One-locus two-allele models with maternal (parental) selection, Genetics, 149, pp. 1147-1152, (1998); Hastings A., Disequilibrium, selection, and recombination: Limits in two-locus, two-allele models, Genetics, 98, pp. 659-668, (1981); Hastings A., Stable cycling in discrete-time genetic models, Proc.

In this essay I review various answers to the question of the driving force that motivates action and that propels a sequence, continuous or discontinuous. These answers underpin narrative strategies intended to solve the problem of human agency and thereby to provide the basis for historical narratives. I argue that both continuous and discontinuous conceptions of history have to do with the restrictive concept of trajectory. Most of our familiar concepts such as trajectory, equilibrium, optimum, probability, and sensitivity to initial conditions are taken from mathematics and physics, but how well adapted are they to dealing with the time of actors, whose actions are intermingled with uncertainty? I shall present alternative concepts of dynamics, ones that no longer lead toward just one particular future or that reflect a single past. On this basis I suggest reorganizing our view of historical time along the principles of maintenance, acquisition, and victory. Historical sources trace back not to one story or one process that is plausible or that appeals to common sense, but to a whole family of processes. From the past, we can obtain sets of constraints that circumscribe sets of stories rather than a single scenario. I shall then propose a topology of the time of action based on my alternative conception of dynamics, a topology made of what I call viability kernels, capture basins, and victory domains. © Wesleyan University 2010.","Connectedness;

Viability is the property for a state x that there exists a trajectory starting from x and satisfying the constraints until the time horizon. To obtain this, connection matrices must be selected at each time and each visited state among a specific set, the regulation map, which is carefully defined and built. Two examples, Sampson's monks and Padgett and Ansell' Florentines, illustrate the viability approach of dynamic networks. Notably, the relationship with centrality is studied.

The arbitrage involves subjective satisfaction with the quality of life, anticipated survival, and consumption profiles.

Measles is responsible for 31% of deaths of children 6 months to 9 years old. Under the mortality conditions of the period studied, a 6-month-old child has a 15% chance of dying from measles at some point. Children with siblings have a higher mortality risk during measles epidemics than children without siblings. Since the risk of infection seems equal in these two groups, the difference is probably due to more severe infection among multiple cases with close contact.

In spite of the noisy appearance of its evolution, the trajectory of If looks ordered, as if it were confined alternatively to two given zones, looping in each of them for a while, then suddenly jumping from the low one to the higher one, or slowly whirling down from the high to the low one. An attempt is made to explain this general temporal structure by using a simulation model based on the autoregulation model (the so-called European Marriage Pattern), putting into play a choice of the spouse function, a fertility function, modalities of marriage and remarriage, under the environmental forcing of the reconstructed mortality conditions. The correspondence between reconstruction and simulation turns out to be quite good, not only for the population size or the Coale index, but also for the marriage series, quite independently of the reconstruction. A second simulation with simulated mortality conditions shows a bifurcation point: as the mean frequency of crisis increases, the state of the system leaves the lower level and concentrates more and more in the higher level. Thus, not only does the autoregulator model appear validated by empirical data, but its bi-modal structure is revealed, depicting the dynamic response of a traditional community both to the environment and to the endogeneous demographic process. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Conversely, waiting too long leads to losing elderly patients who could have been saved by ventilators. As age and sex are major determinants of mortality by Covid-19 and have the merit, in contrast to other priority criteria, of being immediately available to health professionals, the criterion is the minimization of the mean mortality rate weighted by age- and sex-specific life expectancies. The dynamics is a queuing process involving mortality and return home flows and competition between ages. The result is the determination of an optimal threshold age that can guide triage. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Covid-19; Intensive care unit; M/M/c; Queueing theory; Triage","","","","","","","","Alvarez F., Argente D., Lippi F., A Simple planning problem for COVID-19 lockdown: EIEF Working Paper 20/05, (2020); Angus D.C., Seymour C.W., Coopersmith C.M., Et al., A framework for the development and interpretation of different sepsis definitions and clinical criteria, Crit.

Hazard rates modeling the instantaneous risk of catching the disease were estimated under the exponential distribution and with satisfactory goodness of fit. This class of models shows that the hypothesis of the absence of parental imprinting cannot be rejected for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.","","allele; article; gene segregation; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genome imprinting; genotype; HLA system; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; onset age; priority journal","","","","","","","Abel L., Bonney G.E., A time-dependent logistic hazard function for modelling variable age of onset in analysis of familial diseases, Genet Epidemiol, 7, pp. 391-407, (1990); Baur M.P., Neugebauer M., Deppe H., Sigmund M., Luton T., Mayr W.R., Alber E.D., Population analysis on the basis of deduced haplotypes from random families, Histocompatibility Testing 1984, pp. 677-755, (1984); Bonney G.E., Regressive logistic models for familial disease and other binary traits, Biometrics, 42, pp. 611-625, (1986); Clerget-Darpoux F., Babron M.C., Testing genetic models for IDDM by the MASC method, Genet Epidemiol, 6, pp. 59-64, (1989); Clerget-Darpoux F., Babron M.C., Deschamps I., Hors J., Complementation and maternal effect in insulin-dependent diabetes, Ann Hum Genet, 49, pp. 42-48, (1991); Clerget-Darpoux F., Babron M.C., Prum B., Lathrop G.M., Deschamps I., Hors J., A new method to test genetic models in HLA associated diseases: The MASC method, Ann Hum Genet, 42, pp. 247-258, (1988); Clerget-Darpoux F., Dizier M.H., Bonaite-Pellie C., Babron M.C., Hochez J., Martinez M., Discrimination between genetic models for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, Genet Epidemiol, 3, 1 SUPPL., pp. 313-318, (1986); Cox D.R., Oakes D., Analysis of Survival Data, (1984); Cudworth A.G., Woodrow J.C., Evidence for HLA linked in juvenile diabetes mellitus, BMJ, 3, pp. 133-135, (1975); Deschamps I., Hors J., Clerget-Darpoux F., Gardais E., Robert J., Marcelli-Barge A., Lestradet H., Et al., Excess of maternal HLA-DR3 antigens in HLA DR3, 4 positive type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients, Diabetologia, 33, pp. 425-430, (1990); Elston R.C., Ascertainment and age of onset in pedigree analysis, Hum Hered, 23, pp. 105-112, (1973); Hodge S.E., Rotter J.I., Lange K., A three-allele model for heterogeneity of juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes, Ann Hum Genet, 43, pp. 349-409, (1980); Khalil I., D'Auriol L., Gobet M., Morin L., Lepage V., Deschamps I., Sik Park M., Et al., A combination of HLA-DQβ Asp57 negative and HLA Arg52 confers susceptibility to IDDM, J Clin Invest, 85, pp. 1315-1319, (1990); Louis E.J., Thomson G., Three allele synergistic mixed model for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Diabetes, 35, pp. 958-963, (1986); Margaritte-Jeannin P., Clerget-Darpoux F., Hors J., Deschamps I., Testing parental imprinting in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by the marker-association-segregation-χ<sup>2</sup> method, Am J Hum Genet, 56, pp. 1080-1087, (1995); Risch N., Segregation analysis incorporating linkage markers.
