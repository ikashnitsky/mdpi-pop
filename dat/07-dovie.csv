The results intimate the lack of geriatric infrastructure, hence the inadequacy of geriatric care provision for older adults. Systemic problems or gaps existent in Ghana led to private individuals taking advantage of the situation, turning it into an opportunity for service providers. Thus, the evolution of recreational/residential homes in Ghana is situated along three distinct patterns or forms namely the occasional, the adult day care center and residential archetypes. Collectively, these constitute formal and informal care facilities. These are often privately owned and at a cost. The nature of quality of care may be affected by the types of homes available, especially in the globalized cultural setting. A growing number of older adults resort to care homes as an alternative measure. These are discussed from two viewpoints. First, geriatric data generation, the absence of which impedes healthcare provision. Second, cash-for-care policies may exacerbate existing inequalities in care with negative consequences for health and well-being. In short, policies for aging populations are being implemented across Ghana with too little known about their consequences for inequalities in health and well-being in later life. The paper sought to address this knowledge gap by exploring a significant infrastructure by undertaking a systematic examination of how recent policy developments for aging exacerbate or reduce inequalities in health and well-being among older adults. The paper concludes that social policy for aging societies' specific key pillars (healthcare and social care research) offers opportunities for analyzing and understanding internal dynamics including the effects of policy implementation for inequalities in health and well-being at older ages, therefore enabling the identification of strategies to improve older adults' circumstances, without which older adult population will far outpace elder care provision. © Copyright © 2019 Dovie.","adjustment; geriatric care; healthcare; institutional care homes; loneliness; old age; older adults; social interaction","","","","","","University of Ghana-Carnegie Next Generation of Academics, (UGFD/cc/061/2014-2015)","This research work was supported by the University of Ghana-Carnegie Next Generation of Academics in Africa Project, Legon-Accra.

Using qualitative explorative approach, the scope of the research is to examine opportunities that focus on healthy aging in order to enhance healthcare infrastructure in Ghana in preparation for an increased number of older adults. The paper mainly finds that improved healthcare solicitation and the social world of older adults are intricately linked. The healthcare needs of older adults are met through diverse mechanisms-the Pensioners' Medical Scheme and ceragim concept. These depict a transformation in healthcare access and delivery with implications for wider healthcare, solidarity and efficiency. Active ageing strategies therefore facilitate the provision of supplementary healthcare access by seeking health solutions independently, including the creation of awareness about the challenges and the concomitant health resource opportunities for older adults. These have the tendency for the development of an acumen for healthcare-related resilience. I argue that health-related challenges depict opportunities for smarter solutions and mutual growth, further showing that aging is gain and a human development issue that fosters the emergence of an integrated healthcare system. Crucially, the paper reveals that health-related challenges are used to leverage entry and participation in the healthcare products' market and by extension access to quality and holistic healthcare services. This encompasses innovative healthcare infrastructural resources that Ghanaian older adults patronize. These health resources are worth pursuing and may need to be incorporated into the National Policy on Ageing, with envisaged universal coverage in focus. © 2019 by the authors.","Active aging; Healthcare;

The findings show that the onset of offending in later life is embedded in diverse scenarios including a survival strategy pertaining to engagement in economic activities for survival with retirement planning implications. Correspondingly, the crimes committed are violent, namely, murder, causing physical harm, food poisoning, and those that are non-violent, namely, narcotics dealings, petty thievery in nature. Among others, cognitive impairment/dementia and poverty are contributory factors to the incarnation of older offenders between one month and 27 years. The older offenders were involved in second line criminal activities, namely, the sale of stolen goods obtained from first liners. Compliance with prison rules incentivised reduced prison sentence years, fostered peace of mind. Tipping colleague inmates to execute allotted prison work is another coping strategy resulting from inability to do same. Imprisonment induced Christianity-oriented reformation, served as an integrative factor between criminality and serving prison sentence(s). Also worth reiterating is the fact that imprisonment may induce stigmatisation and isolation-related loneliness, while serving as an antidote to the pangs of loneliness with consequences for recidivism among older offenders. Gerontological offending has debilitating effects on older adults and is associated with the social isolation of an age cohort that is already predisposed to witchcraft accusations. The conduction of cognitive impairment/dementia tests on older offenders may moderate the sentence they receive. © 2023 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

A total of 300 individuals aged between 13 years and 60+ participated in the study. Data were collected utilising questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that individuals who had experienced two or more childhood adversities were more likely to have poorer physical health and mental health functioning in older ages compared to those with no childhood adversities. These may predispose experiencers to detrimental health and other situational consequences. The findings show the direct influence of childhood experiences on later life especially from diverse dimensions including health. Quintessentially, childhood experiences of poverty, starvation, family disintegration, neglect, abandonment, abuse, etc., predispose experiencers to detrimental health and other situational consequences. A distinct interaction exists between childhood experiences and those of old age. The findings have implications for social acceptability for both children and older adults. These are suggestive of the fact that social policies aimed at promoting old age quality need to go beyond the stage of old age to targeting early childhood social conditions. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Anna Wanka, Tabea Freutel-Funke, Sabine Andresen and Frank Oswald individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Adu-Gyamfi J., Young people’s participation in policy formulation and implementation: A case study of the national youth policy of Ghana, (2013); Adu-Gyamfi J., Can children and young people be empowered in participatory initiatives?: Perspectives from young people’s participation in policy formulation and implementation in Ghana, Children and Youth Services Review, 35, pp. 1766-1772, (2013); Afifi T.O., Fortier J., MacMillan H.L., Gonzalez A., Kimber M., Georgiades K., Duncan L., Taillieu T., Davila I.G., Struck S., Examining the relationships between parent experi-ences and youth self-reports of slapping/spanking: A population-based cross-sectional study, BMC Public Health, 19, (2019); Ahn H.J., Garandeau C.F., Rodkin P.C., Effects of classroom embeddedness and density on the social status of aggressive and victimized children, The Journal of Early Adolescence, 30, pp. 76-101, (2012); Akpalu D.A., Adoption of children and the contribution of the OSU Children’s home in Ghana, Journal of Children and Youth Services Review, 29, 8, pp. 1070-1084, (2007); Alastalo H., von Bonsdorff M.B., Raikkonen K., Et al., Early life stress and physical and psychosocial functioning in late adulthood, PLoS ONE, 8, (2013); Alwin D.F., Integrating varieties of life course concepts, Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 67B, 2, pp. 206-220, (2012); Alwin D.F., Thornton A., Family origins and the schooling process: Early versus late influence of parental characteristics, American Sociological Review, 49, pp. 784-802, (1984); Amato P.R., Children of divorced parents as young adults, Cop-ing with divorce, single parenting, and remarriage, pp. 147-163, (1999); Amato P.R., Nonresident fathers and children’s well-being: A meta-analysis, Journal of Marriage and Family, 61, pp. 557-573, (1999); Balkin E.J., Kollerup M.G., Kymre I.G., Martinsen B., Gankaer M., Ethics and the impossibility of the consent form: Ethnography in a Danish nursing home, Journal of Ageing Stud-ies, 64, (2023); Barnes L.L., Wilson R.S., Everson-Rose S.A., Et al., Effects of early-life adversity on cognitive decline in older African Americans and Whites, Neurology, 79, pp. 2321-2327, (2012); Bjorkqvist K., Lagerspetz K.M., Kaukiainen A., Do girls manipulate and boys fight?

For the study, simple random sampling was undertaken in selecting 361 respondents, while ten participants were selected through purposive sampling. The authors made use of mixed methods, including the interview survey method. The data were subjected to bivariate, correlation and thematic analysis. Concerning the results, younger people turn out to be comparatively more digitally active and more digitally skilled than older people, which is indicative of the fact that there is a generational gap between the two distinct generations in terms of being in a technologically savvy position. This was influenced significantly by the era in which they were born, as each generation comes with its own technological innovations, the phenomena of socialization and social interaction with self-organization as the focus. It is concluded that digital literacy, expositions and exploits are significant in relation to how they shape generational interactions, including the adaptation to digital device utilization in later life. © 2019, University of Zagreb.

Methods: The sample for the study consisted of 442 respondents using a multi-stage sampling technique. Results: The context in which houses are situated affects social support networks, physical and mental health outcomes. House ownership is then a precondition that enables social contact within neighborhoods. A Cramer’s V test value of 0.750 suggests a strong association between house ownership and health outcomes. Conclusion: House acquisition and ownership can potentially improve overall physical, and mental health and wellbeing. © 2019 by the author.
