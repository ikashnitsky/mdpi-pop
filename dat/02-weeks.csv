A review of the literature indicates a number of contrasting definitions of what vulnerability means, as well as numerous conflicting perspectives on what should or should not be included within the broad assessment of vulnerability in cities. This paper reports on the findings from a project in which a GIS methodology has been developed to assess urban vulnerability through a spatial analytical procedure. First, we highlight the deficiencies of current GIS approaches to urban vulnerability analysis and discuss the ill-structured nature of the vulnerability problem. We then propose a working definition for vulnerability assessment in which vulnerability is thought of as a spatial decision problem under the conditions of uncertainty. Next, we present a methodology to incorporate this definition into a GIS framework that combines elements from the techniques of spatial multicriteria analysis and fuzzy logic. The application of this methodology is then illustrated with a case study from Los Angeles County. The results suggest that the proposed methodology may provide a new approach for analyzing vulnerability that can add to our understanding of human/hazards interaction.","","United States; earthquake; GIS; natural hazard; spatial analysis; urban area; vulnerability","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (BCS-0095641, BCS-0117863)","This research has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (BCS-0117863 and BCS-0095641).

Accra, Ghana, implements a rationing system to distribute limited piped water resources within the city, and privately-vended sachet water-sealed single-use plastic sleeves-has filled an important gap in urban drinking water security. This study utilizes household survey data from 2,814 Ghanaian women to analyze the sociodemographic characteristics of those who resort to sachet water as their primary drinking water source. In multilevel analysis, sachet use is statistically significantly associated with lower overall self-reported health, younger age, and living in a lower-class enumeration area. Sachet use is marginally associated with more days of neighborhood water rationing, and significantly associated with the proportion of vegetated land cover. Cross-level interactions between rationing and proxies for poverty are not associated with sachet consumption after adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic, socioeconomic, health, and environmental factors. These findings are generally consistent with two other recent analyses of sachet water in Accra and may indicate a recent transition of sachet consumption from higher to lower socioeconomic classes. Overall, the allure of sachet water displays substantial heterogeneity in Accra and will be an important consideration in planning for future drinking water demand throughout West Africa. © 2013 Stoler et al.","","Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drinking Water; Family Characteristics; Female; Ghana; Humans; Middle Aged; drinking water; article; controlled study; data analysis; environmental factor; female; geographic distribution; Ghana; health status; health survey; human; poverty; sachet water consumption; socioeconomics; urban area; water analysis; water management; water supply; women's health; adult; cross-sectional study; family size; middle aged","","Drinking Water, ","","","United States Agency for International Development; World Health Organization; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD054906); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","","Progress on sanitation and drinking water: 2010 update, (2010); World Urbanization Prospects: The 2009 Revision, (2010); Drinking water: Equity, safety and sustainability, (2011); Fink G., Gunther I., Hill K., The effect of water and sanitation on child health: evidence from the demographic and health surveys 1986-2007, International Journal of Epidemiology, 2011, pp. 1-9, (2011); Nsiah-Gyabaah K., The looming national dilemma of water crisis in peri-urban areas in Ghana, (2001); Van-Rooijen D.J., Spalthoff D., Raschid-Sally L., Domestic water supply in Accra: How physical and social constraints to planning have greater consequences for the poor, (2008); National Water Sector Assessment: Ghana, (2005); Stoler J., Fink G., Weeks J.R., Appiah Otoo R., Ampofo J.A., Et al., When urban taps run dry: Sachet water consumption and health effects in low income neighborhoods of Accra, Ghana, Health & Place, 18, pp. 250-262, (2012); Thompson J., Porras I.T., Wood E., Tumwine J.K., Mujwahuzi M.R., Et al., Waiting at the tap: Changes in urban water use in East Africa over three decades, Environment and Urbanization, 12, pp. 37-52, (2000); Sanitation and Water: Sixth Report of Session 2006-07, House of Commons, (2007); The Millennium Development Goals Report 2008, (2008); Human Development Report 2006: Beyond scarcity: Power, poverty and the global water crisis, (2006); Clasen T.F., Scaling up household water treatment among urban populations, (2009); Hill A.G., Darko R., Seffah J., Adanu R.M.K., Anarfi J.K., Et al., Health of urban Ghanaian women as identified by the Women's Health Study of Accra, International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics, 99, pp. 150-156, (2007); Final report on the Women's Health Study of Accra, Wave II, (2011); Weeks J.R., Getis A., Stow D., Hill A.G., Rain D., Et al., Connecting the dots between health, poverty and place in Accra, Ghana, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 102, pp. 932-941, (2012); Weeks J.R., Getis A., Hill A.G., Agyei-Mensah S., Rain D., Neighborhoods and fertility in Accra, Ghana: An AMOEBA-based approach, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 100, pp. 558-578, (2010); Krieger N., Overcoming the absence of socioeconomic data in medical records: validation and application of a census-based methodology, American Journal of Public Health, 82, pp. 703-710, (1992); Krieger N., Williams D., Moss N., Measuring social class in US public health research: concepts, methodologies and guidelines, Annual Review of Public Health, 18, pp. 341-378, (1997); Lynch J., Kaplan G., Socioeconomic Position, Social Epidemiology, pp. 13-35, (2000); Poverty and Environment Indicators, (2008); Weeks J.R., Hill A.G., Stow D.A., Getis A., Fugate D., Can we spot a neighborhood from the ground?

Researchers in the US have been able to create estimates of how many unauthorised immigrants come from each country, but there has been little research on the geographical origins of immigrants from within Mexico. In this research we make use of a unique unduplicated file of people detained at or near the border by the US Border Patrol during the years 1999 to 2006. By focusing especially on the population aged 20-34, we are able to create a migration propensity index, which is the ratio of detainees from each state in Mexico to the population aged 20-34 in that state. The analysis of this index confirms the few other sources of information suggesting that migration from Mexico to the US is increasingly occurring from the more southern, indigenous states. A multiple regression analysis of the migration propensity index and state-level variables finds that the death rate from accidents and violence among men aged 20-34 is the single most important predictor of a state's migration propensity index. This is related to a variety of factors indicating that migrants come from states with the poorest economic infrastructure. We discuss the implications of these shifts for both receiving and sending communities. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Migration propensity; Undocumented immigrants; US-Mexico border","Mexico [North America]; United States; border region; illegal immigrant; immigrant population; international migration; migration determinant; population migration","","","","","","","Anguiano Tellez M.E., Emigrantes Indocumentados y Deportados Residentes en el Estado de Mexico, Papeles de Poblacion, 36, pp. 133-161, (2003); Astorga L., (1999); Bledsoe C., Houle R., Sow P., High fertility Gambians in low fertility Spain: the dynamics of child accumulation across transnational space, Demographic Research, 16, pp. 375-412, (2007); On integrating immigrants in Germany, Population and Development Review, 32, pp. 597-599, (2006); Burt J.E., Barber G.M., Elementary Statistics for Geographers, (1996); Castaneda J., Ex Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants, (2007); Castles S., Miller M.J., The Age of Migration, (2003); Cohen J., The Culture of Migration in Southern Mexico, (2005); Coleman D., Immigration and ethnic change in low-fertility countries: a third demographic transition, Population and Development Review, 32, pp. 401-446, (2006); Cornelius W.A., Impacts of Border Enforcement on Mexican Migration: The View from Sending Communities, Introduction: does border enforcement deter unauthorized immigration?, pp. 1-15, (2007); Cornelius W., Borger S., Sawyer A., Keyes D., Appleby C., Parks K., Lozada G., Hicken J., Controlling Unauthorized Immigration From Mexico: The Failure of 'Prevention through Deterrence' and the Need for Comprehensive Reform, (2008); Cornelius W., Fitzgerald D., Fischer P.L., Mayan Journeys: The New Migration from Yucatán to the United States, (2008); Davis K., The theory of change and response in modern demographic history, Population Index, 29, pp. 345-366, (1963); Donato K.M., Patterson E., Crossing the Border: Research from the Mexican Migration Project, Women and men on the move: undocumented border crossing, pp. 111-130, (2004); Durand J., Massey D.S., Zenteno R.M., Mexican immigration to the United States: continuities and changes, Latin American Research Review, 36, pp. 107-127, (2001); Durand J., Massey D.S., Crossing the Border: Research from the Mexican Migration Project, What we learned from the Mexican Migration Project, pp. 1-16, (2004); Fox J., Rivera-Salgado G., Indigenous Mexican Migrants in the United States, Building civil society among indigenous migrants, pp. 1-25, (2004); Hoefer M., Rytina N., Baker B.C., (2008); Levitch M., (2007); Marcelli E.A., Cornelius W.A., The changing profile of Mexican migrants to the United States: new evidence from California and Mexico, Latin American Research Review, 36, 3, pp. 105-131, (2001); Marks A., A harder look at visa overstayers, Christian Science Monitor, (2002); Massey D., An evaluation of international migration theory: the North American case, Population and Development Review, 20, pp. 699-752, (1994); Massey D., Arango J., Hugo G., Kouaouci A., Pellegrino A., Taylor J.E., Theories of international migration: a review and appraisal, Population and Development Review, 19, pp. 431-466, (1993); Massey D., Espinosa K., What's driving Mexico-U.S. migration?

The findings suggest that recent older immigrants are, in fact, more isolated than elders in other migration/residence statuses. However, immigration seems to exert an overall low level of influence on isolation, whereas ethnicity independently appears to exert a greater influence. © 1983, Sage Publications.

The high level of indoor tanning by this age group may be due, in part, to the large number of tanning facilities in US cities. This study examined how facilities are distributed throughout one large county. Based on ecological models, it was predicted that tanning facilities are more likely to be located within certain neighborhoods based on the neighborhood's distributions of demographic factors, including income, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, age, and sex. We also explored whether selected aspects of the built environment, including the numbers of high schools and fitness centers, would predict the number of tanning facilities. The number of tanning facilities within 605 census tracts of San Diego County was examined through geographic information systems mapping. Results from multivariate Poisson log-linear regression indicated that higher numbers or proportions of the following variables within a census tract were significantly, positively correlated with the number of tanning facilities: fitness centers, teenagers 15-19 years, females 15-24 years, females 25-29 years, and non-Hispanic Whites. Results from additional analyses using a 1000-foot buffer zone around each census tract boundary showed that higher relative distributions of the following variables were significantly, positively correlated with the number of tanning facilities: high schools, fitness centers, females 15-24 years, females 25-29 years, and non-Hispanic Whites. These findings suggest a relationship exists between the numbers of tanning facilities and certain built-environmental and demographic characteristics within census tracts. Determining this relationship is important for developing future interventions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ecological model; Geographic information systems; Indoor tanning; Skin cancer","Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Beauty Culture; California; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fitness Centers; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Sex Distribution; Skin Neoplasms; Ultraviolet Rays; adolescent; adult; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; geographic information system; health center; human; population research; prevalence; skin cancer; ultraviolet radiation; United States","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA093532)","Acknowledgements Supported by grants #R01CA93532 and K05CA10051 from the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute.

This study examines vulnerability in relation to flooding, environmental degradation, social status, demographics, and health in the slums of Accra, Ghana, by utilizing a place-based approach informed by fieldwork, remote sensing, census data, and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The study objectives are threefold: (1) to move slums from a dichotomous into a continuous classification and examine the spatial patterns of the gradient, (2) to develop measures of vulnerability for a developing world city and model the relationship between slums and vulnerability, and (3) to assess if the most vulnerable individuals live in the worst slums. A previously developed slum index is utilized, and four new measures of vulnerability are developed through principal components analysis (PCA), including a novel component of health vulnerability based on child mortality. Visualizations of the vulnerability measures assess spatial patterns of vulnerability in Accra. Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial, and GWR model the ability of the slum index to predict the four vulnerability measures. The slum index performs well for three of the four vulnerability measures, but is least able to predict health vulnerability, underscoring the complex relationship between slums and child mortality in Accra. Finally, quintile analysis demonstrates the elevated prevalence of high vulnerability in places with high slum index scores. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","geographically weighted regression; health; slums; vulnerability","Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra; child mortality; demography; environmental degradation; flooding; health status; least squares method; principal component analysis; regression analysis; social status; spatial analysis; urban system; visualization; vulnerability","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD054906); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This research was funded by grant number R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (‘Health, Poverty and Place in Accra, Ghana’, John R.

While this unit of analysis is acceptable to many social science researchers, defining what a neighborhood is has been left up to the individual researcher. In many cases a proxy such as the census tract, ZIP Code or other pre-defined unit of analysis is used. Using a pre-defined unit of analysis reduces the amount of work involved and allows for comparisons to be made between the phenomenon under study (i.e., health, wealth, race) and the information for which the unit was created (i.e., census demographic variables). While allowing for a more straightforward, simpler study, predefined units do not always represent socially meaningful areas that are of symbolic significance to residents or the actual neighborhood boundaries that residents would use to describe their neighborhood. In addition, the choice of the neighborhood unit can affect the results of any study because of the modified areal unit problem (MAUP) (Openshaw and Taylor 1979). Therefore, choosing the appropriate neighborhood boundaries is an important part of any neighborhood study. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Census Tract; Drainage Canal; Enumeration Area; Symbolic Significance; Taxi Driver","","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Funding text 1: This research was supported by Grant Number R01HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Neighborhoods, however, are difficult to define both in theory and in practice, and are often drawn to follow existing administrative boundaries or sampling schemes, or must be set arbitrarily due to a lack of sufficient data. Given the role of neighborhood context in influencing health outcomes, it is crucial that the area of influence surrounding the unit of analysis (be it a person, household, etc.) be properly defined. As already discussed in previous chapters, if we do not identify neighborhoods correctly, we cannot properly evaluate neighborhood effects. Defining neighborhoods is a challenge across the social sciences; investigations of the role of neighborhood context in decision making and shaping of individual-level outcomes are seen in public health, geography, demography, and sociology with no consistent approach to identifying and evaluating neighborhood effects. In this chapter, we outline several types of neighborhood definitions from the literature, and then, using data from the Women’s Health Study of Accra, implement a spatial model together with a simulation approach to examine how two alternative neighborhood definitions affect modeling of individual-level health outcomes. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Land Cover; Land Cover Change; Neighborhood Context; Neighborhood Effect; Spatial Autocorrelation","","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; United States Agency for International Development, USAID; World Health Organization, WHO; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Funding text 1: This research was funded in part by grant number R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“Health, Poverty and Place in Accra, Ghana,” John R.

Population growth is impacting the natural environment, mostly through land cover and land use change (LCLUC), and particularly associated with agriculture expansion and urbanization. Monitoring LCLUC is necessary in order to understand the overall dynamics of population, LCLU and quality of life. However, extensive cloud cover in the region complicates satellite-based monitoring of LCLUC. Our objectives are to evaluate an innovative “dense stack” approach to image classification with extremely cloudy, multi-temporal Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery, map and quantify LCLU within southern Ghana for circa 2000 and circa 2010, examine LCLU changes, and assess the utility of the approach for monitoring human-induced change. Maximum value composite images (derived from the dense stacks) provide unique information for classifying the LCLU classes of interest, and accuracy assessment results indicate effective overall classification of the six LCLU classes mapped using semi-automated methods. A product we developed and refer to as the spectral variability vegetation index (SVVI) plays a major role in discriminating three natural vegetation classes and agriculture. Derived circa 2000 and circa 2010 LCLU maps indicate that approximately 26% of the study area exhibited LCLU change during the study period. Sixty-two percent (62%) of the changes are associated with conversion to Agriculture, with 33% from Secondary Forest, 26% from Savanna, and 3% from Forest. During the same period, 18% of circa 2000 land classified as Agriculture was fallow or abandoned by circa 2010. Change to Built represented 6% of the LCLU change, which includes 5% from Agriculture and 1% from Secondary Forest circa 2000. Freely available Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery and the time-series classification methods developed here may be used to further monitor LCLU change in the region and throughout the world, particularly in cloud-prone equatorial areas. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Africa; Dense time stacks; Ghana; Land cover land use change; Landsat; Population; Temporal compositing","Ghana; Agriculture; Classification (of information); Economics; Forestry; Land use; Population statistics; Vegetation; Africa; Compositing; Dense-time; Ghana; Land cover land use changes; LANDSAT; Population; accuracy assessment; agricultural extension; anthropogenic effect; cloud cover; economic development; environmental monitoring; image classification; land cover; land use change; population growth; satellite imagery; urbanization; vegetation index; Image classification","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (G00009708)","This work was supported by the Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science (IDS) program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NASA award number G00009708 .

This fact alone provides a rationale for this volume, but there are also broad policy and programmatic reasons for our interest in the demography, health and well-being of urban centers in low income countries. Cities in developing countries are the power-houses of national economic growth, not least because they contain some of the most skilled, best educated and economically productive people in their respective countries. Despite these advantages, there are major threats to the future success of such cities, including those related to governance, provision of water, sanitation and housing, as well as the emergence of stark inequalities in income, wealth, and health. These issues offer challenges to our knowledge and understanding of the processes of urbanization and economic growth, provoking comparisons with the late nineteenth and early twentieth century transitions in health, mortality, fertility and economic activity in the industrializing cities of northwest Europe and North America. Today’s high income countries are struggling with the administration and financing of their modern welfare states, while leaders in low income countries are casting around for equitable solutions that produce full employment and rising incomes without leaving large sections of the population impoverished and resentful of the success of their neighbors. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","African City; Land Cover Class; Neighborhood Context; Reproductive Health; Satellite Imagery","","","","","","","","Adanu R.M.K., Seffah J., Anarfi J., Lince N., Blanchard K., Sexual and reproductive health in Accra, Ghana.

Because the availability of commercial indoor tanning facilities may influence use, data are needed on the number and density of such facilities. Methods: In March 2006, commercial indoor tanning facilities in 116 large U.S. cities were identified, and the number and density (per 100,000 population) were computed for each city. Bivariate and multivariate analyses conducted in 2008 tested the association between tanning-facility density and selected geographic, climatologic, demographic, and legislative variables. Results: Mean facility number and density across cities were 41.8 (SD=30.8) and 11.8 (SD=6.0), respectively. In multivariate analysis, cities with higher percentages of whites and lower ultraviolet (UV)index scores had significantly higher facility densities than those with lower percentages of whites and higher UV index scores. Conclusions: These data indicate that commercial indoor tanning is widely available in the urban U.S., and this availability may help explain the high usage of indoor tanning. © 2009 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.","","Beauty Culture; Commerce; European Continental Ancestry Group; Humans; Melanoma; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasms, Squamous Cell; Skin Neoplasms; Sunbathing; Ultraviolet Rays; United States; Urban Population","","","","","NIH National Cancer Institute, (R01CA093532); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (K05CA100051); National Cancer Institute, NCI","The authors wish to thank Dr. George Belch, Dr. Jean Forster, Dr. Todd Gilmer, Dr. Martin Weinstock, Ami Hurd, Latrice Pichon, Justin Shepard, and Debra Rubio for their help with this study.

While child marriage in Niger is clearly normative in the sense that it is commonly practiced, the social and contextual factors that contribute to it are still unclear. Methods: Here, we tested the importance of village-level factors as predictors of young age at marriage for a group of married adolescent girls (N = 1031) in the Dosso district of rural Niger, using multi-level and geographic analyses. We aggregated significant individual level factors to determine whether, independent of a girl's own sociodemographic characteristics, the impact of each factor is associated at the village level. Finally, we tested for spatial dependence and heterogeneity in examining whether the village-level associations we find with age at marriage differ geographically. Results: The mean age of marriage for girls in our study was 14.20 years (SD 1.8). Our statistical results are consistent with other literature suggesting that education is associated with delayed marriage, even among adolescent girls. Younger ages at marriage are also associated with a greater age difference between spouses and with a greater likelihood of women being engaged in agricultural work. Consistent with results at the individual level, at the village level we found that the proportion of girls who do agricultural work and the mean age difference between spouses were both predictive of a lower age at marriage for individual girls. Finally, mapping age at marriage at the village level revealed that there is geographical variation in age at marriage, with a cluster of hot spots in the Hausa-dominated eastern area where age at marriage is particularly low and a cluster of cold spots in the Zarma-dominated western areas where age at marriage is relatively high. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that large-scale approaches to eliminating child marriage in these communities may be less successful if they do not take into consideration geographically and socially determined contextual factors at the village level. © 2020 The Author(s).","Early marriage; Hot spot analysis; Niger; Social norms; Spatial analysis, geographically weighted regression","Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Female; Geography; Humans; Marriage; Niger; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Spatial Analysis; adolescent; age; child; epidemiology; female; geography; human; marriage; Niger; rural population; socioeconomics; spatial analysis","","","","","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1066462); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (K01HD087551–01); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This work was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Grant # OPP1066462 and NICHD Grant # K01HD087551–01.

To do this, we assessed the village-level normative and network factors associated with adolescent birth (birth taking place before age 20 years) in rural Honduras and evaluated the geographic dispersion of these patterns. We used full population data from 24,937 people in 176 villages (81% of the eligible population) to assess prevalence and patterns of adolescent childbearing among women. We modeled the predictors of adolescent births among women younger than 21 years. After accounting for individual demographic characteristics, one of the strongest predictors of adolescent birth within the population was village-level collective norms about the acceptability of adolescent childbearing, based on aggregating normative measures from the entire population. The proportion of women in the village who had given birth as an adolescent was also strongly associated with an individual girl's likelihood of having given birth as an adolescent. We used full village-level network analyses to calculate social cohesion within the village. Normative pressure was strongly associated with the likelihood of an adolescent birth in villages with high cohesion (high network density) and was not associated or had a weak association in villages with low cohesion. On the other hand, the longer a girl had lived in the village, the stronger the association between the overall proportion of women in that village who gave birth as adolescents and the girl's own likelihood of having done so. Spatial analyses suggest that levels of adolescent births vary spatially across villages, as do the village-level normative factors associated with them. © 2019 The Authors","Adolescent fertility; Honduras; Social cohesion; Social networks; Social norms; Spatial analysis","adolescent; article; child; female; fertility; girl; Honduras; human; pregnancy; prevalence; social network; social norm; spatial analysis","","","","","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1098684); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (K01HD087551); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Funding provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , grant number OPP1098684 , and NICHD grant number K01HD087551 .

For this reason there have been few serious attempts to quantify the geographic distribution of the Muslim population within the United States. Several recent surveys have provided a narrowing range of estimates of the likely size of the national U.S. population and, importantly, have provided a means for estimating the percentage of African Americans who are Muslim. Using these survey data in combination with 1990 PUMS data and recently released Census 2000 data on ancestry, language, and place of birth, I have produced estimates of the Muslim population by state. My overall national estimate based on this technique is 3.4 million Muslim as of 2000, which is slightly higher than, but close to the range of estimates generated from all recent surveys except one. The Muslim Population is currently growing at a rate of about 3.5 percent per year which is almost three times the national rate. I use these estimates at the state level to show that there are clusters of Muslims in the New York-New Jersey region, the Washington, D.C. region, the Great Lakes region, and large populations also in California and Texas. The Muslim population in Texas appears to be growing rapidly, whereas the California population is not.","Geographic distribution; Growth rate; Muslims; Population size; United States","United States; census; estimation method; ethnic minority; population distribution","","","","","","","Fact Sheet: U.S. Muslim Population, (1991); Austin A.D., African Muslims in Antebellum America: A Sourcebook, (1984); Bagby I., Perl P., Froehle B., The Mosque in America: A National Portrait, (2001); Belt D., The world of Islam, National Geographic, (2002); Ghayur M.A., Muslims in the United States: Settlers and visitors, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 454, pp. 150-163, (1981); Goldstein S., Kosmin B., Religious and ethnic self-identification in the United States 1989-90: A case study of the Jewish population, Population Association of America, (1991); Haddad Y.Y., A Century of Islam in America, (1986); Haddad Y.Y., Muslims in America, The Muslim World, 76, pp. 93-122, (1986); Kosmin B., Research Report: The National Survey of Religious Identification 1989-90, (1991); Kosmin B., Lachman S., One Nation Under God: Religion in Contemporary American Society, (1993); Kosmin B., Mayer E., Profile of the U.S. Muslim Population, (2001); Levtzion N., Muslims and Chiefs in West Africa, (1968); Lovell E.K., A survey of the Arab-Muslims in the United States and Canada, Islam in North America: A Sourcebook, (1992); McCloud A.B., African American Islam, (1995); Nyang S., Islam in the United States of America: A review of sources, Islam in North America: A Sourcebook, (1992); Nyang S.S., Islam in the United States of America, (1999); Oatling R.N., Americans facing toward Mecca, Time, (1988); Phillipp T., Muslims, The Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, (1980); Rashid S., Islamic influence in America: Struggle, flight, community, Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, 19, pp. 7-31, (1999); Smith T.W., Estimating the Muslim Population in the United States, (2001); Stone C., Estimate of muslims living in America, The Muslims of America, (1991); Weekes R.A., Muslim Peoples: A World Ethnographic Survey, (1984); Weeks J.R., The demography of Islamic nations, Population Bulletin, 43, pp. 1-53, (1988)","J.R.

A total of 661 principals and 415 teachers in schools with a ninth and/or tenth grade completed surveys examining teacher and course characteristics. Principals reported that approximately half of the FLE teachers in the state held credentials in home economics. Teacher reports concerning academic prepara tion indicated that home economics teachers were significantly more likely than teachers in all other areas except nursing to have obtained preservice training in family life, and to have attended continuing education courses and conferences on the subject. However, home economics teachers were significantly less likely than their colleagues in health, physical education, and nursing to have acquired preservice training in health. Teachers from all disciplines provided coverage of numerous FLE topics in their curricula, with home economics teachers handling significantly longer courses and being more likely to address communication, decisionmaking, marriage, and family issues than teachers from the other areas. FLE programs tended not to be broadly evaluated, but home economics teachers differed significantly from their colleagues in their greater use of measures of student satisfaction.

Urban areas were and are the primary sites for “settling out” and most midwestern cities, from small to large, have a growing number of Chicanos among their inhabitants. Despite the disruption of the Detroit community by urban renewal, there is a wide diversity of organizations, associations, and agencies that function within the Chicano community of that city. The degree of integration of Chicanos seems to be related to the community’s ability to create, maintain, and expand its organizational life. One of the principal implications of this integration is its potential for changes in reproductive behavior among Chicanos, which in turn may affect the abilities of the Mexican American to advance economically. © 1979 by Taylor and Francis.

In this paper we explore the pattern of child mortality inequalities (as a proxy for overall health levels) within a large sub-Saharan African city - Accra, Ghana - and then we examine the extent to which existing residential patterns by ethnicity may be predictive of any observed intra-urban inequalities in child mortality. We find that the spatial variability in child mortality in Accra is especially associated with the pattern of residential separation of the Ga from other ethnic groups, with the Ga having higher levels of mortality than other ethnic groups. Being of Ga ethnicity exposes a woman and her children to characteristics of the places in Accra where the Ga live, in which one-room dwellings and poor infrastructure predominate. At the individual level, we find that regardless of where a woman lives, if she is of Ga ethnicity and/or is non-Christian, and if she is not married, her risks of having lost a child are elevated.

We also utilize GIS technology to measure the association of adverse health and mortality outcomes with neighborhood ecology. We approached this in variety of ways, including multivariate analysis of imagery classification and census data. A key element in the research has been to obtain in-person interviews from 3200 female respondents in the city, and then relate health data obtained from the women to the ecology of the neighborhoods in which they live. Detailed maps are a requirement for these field-based activities. However, commercially available street maps of Accra tend to be highly generalized and not very useful for the kind of health and social science research being undertaken by this project. The purpose of this paper is to describe street maps that were created for the project's office in downtown Accra and used to locate households of respondents. They incorporate satellite imagery with other geographic layers to provide the most important visual interpretation of the linkage between imagery and neighborhoods. Ultimately, through a detailed analysis of spatial disparities in health in Accra, Ghana, we aim to provide a model for the interpretation of urban health inequalities in cities of urbanizing and often poor countries. © 2012 Gregory M.

Two approaches to aggregating census enumeration areas (EAs) based on image-derived measures of vegetation objects were tested: (a) merging adjacent EAs according to vegetation measures, and (b) image segmentation. Both approaches exploit readily available functions within commercial GEOBIA software. Image-derived neighborhood maps were compared to a reference map derived by spatial clustering of slum index values (from census data), to provide a relative assessment of potential map utility. A size-constrained iterative segmentation approach to aggregation was more successful than standard image segmentation or feature merge techniques. The segmentation approaches account for size and shape characteristics, enabling more realistic neighborhood boundaries to be delineated. The percentage of vegetation patches within each EA yielded more realistic delineation of potential neighborhoods than mean vegetation patch size per EA. © 2010 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","","Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra; Iterative methods; Population statistics; Satellite imagery; Surveys; Vegetation; Census enumerations; Derived neighborhoods; Geographic object-based image analysis; Geographic objects; Iterative segmentation; Multi-spectral imagery; QuickBird satellite imagery; Spatial clustering; cluster analysis; image analysis; low income housing; multispectral image; neighborhood; patch size; QuickBird; satellite imagery; software; urban system; vegetation mapping; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Baatz M., Schape A., Multiresolution segmentation-an optimization approach for high quality multi-scale image segmentation, Angewandte Geographische Informationsverarbeitung, 10, pp. 12-23, (2000); Benz U.C., Hofmann P., Willhauck G., Lingenfelder I., Heynen M., Multi-resolution, object-oriented fuzzy analysis of remote sensing data for GIS-ready information, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 58, 3-4, pp. 239-258, (2004); Bjorgo E., Using very high spatial resolution multispectral satellite sensor imagery to monitor refugee camps, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 21, 3, pp. 611-616, (2000); Boulet G., Chehbouni A., Braud I., Vauclin M., Haverkamp R., Zammit C., A simple water and energy balance model designed for regionalization and remote sensing data utilization, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 105, 1-3, pp. 117-132, (2000); Brunner P., Bauer P., Eugster M., Kinzelbach W., Using remote sensing to regionalize local precipitation recharge rates obtained from the Chloride Method, Journal of Hydrology, 294, 4, pp. 241-250, (2004); Duque J.C., Anselin L., Rey S.J., The Max-P-Region Problem, (2007); Duque J.C., Ramos R., Surinach J., Supervised regionalization methods: A survey, International Regional Science Review, 30, 3, pp. 195-220, (2007); Giada S., De Groeve T., Ehrlich D., Soille P., Information extraction from very high resolution satellite imagery over Lukole refugee camp, Tanzania, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 24, 22, pp. 4251-4266, (2003); 2000 Population and Housing Census: Summary Report of Final Results, (2002); Castilla G., Hay G.J., Geographic Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA): A new name for a new discipline, Object-Based Image Analysis - Spatial Concepts for Knowledgedriven Remote Sensing Applications, pp. 75-90, (2008); Lo C.P., Faber B.J., Integration of landsat thematic mapper and census data for quality of life assessment, Remote Sensing of Environment, 62, 2, pp. 143-157, (1997); Montgomery M.R., Hewett P.C., Urban poverty and health in developing countries: Household and neighborhood effects, Demography, 42, 3, pp. 397-425, (2005); Openshaw S., The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, (1983); Rashed T., Remote sensing of within-class change in urban neighborhood, Computers, Environment and Urban Systems; Ridd M.K., Exploring a V-I-S (vegetation-impervious surface-soil) model for urban ecosystem analysis through remote sensing: Comparative anatomy for cities, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 16, 12, pp. 2165-2185, (1995); Sampson R.J., Morenoff J.D., Gannon-Rowley T., Assessing ""neighborhood effects"": Social processes and new directions in research, Annual Review of Sociology, 28, pp. 443-478, (2002); Stow D., Lopez A., Lippitt C., Hinton S., Weeks J., Object-based classification of residential land use within Accra, Ghana based on QuickBird satellite data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 28, 22, pp. 5167-5173, (2007); Talen E., Constructing neighborhoods from the bottom up: The case for resident-generated GIS, Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 26, 4, pp. 533-554, (1999); Tian G., Liu J., Xie Y., Yang Z., Zhuang D., Niu Z., Analysis of spatio-temporal dynamic pattern and driving forces of urban land in China in 1990s using TM images and GIS, Cities, 22, 6, pp. 400-410, (2005); State of the World's Cities 2006/7, (2006); Warren D., Explorations in neighborhood differentiation, Sociological Quarterly, 19, 2, pp. 310-331, (1978); Weeks J.R., Hill A.G., Getis A., Stow D., Ethnic residential patterns as predictors of intra-urban child mortality inequality in Accra, Ghana, Urban Geography, 27, 6, pp. 526-548, (2006); Weeks J.R., Hill A., Stow D., Getis A., Fugate D., Can we spot a neighborhood from the air?

Monitoring forest cover change is critical for assessing ecosystem changes and targeting conservation efforts. Yet the most biodiverse forests on the planet are also the most difficult to monitor remotely due to their frequent cloud cover. To begin to reconcile this problem, we develop and implement an effective and efficient approach to mapping forest loss in the extremely cloud-prevalent southern Ghana region using dense time series Landsat 7 and 8 images from 1999 to 2018, based on median value temporal compositing of a novel vegetation index called the spectral variability vegetation index (SVVI). Resultant land-cover and land-use maps yielded 90 to 94% mapping accuracies. Our results indicate 625 km                             2                              of forest loss within the 9800-km                             2                              total mapping area, including within forest reserves and their environs between circa 2003 and 2018. Within the reserves, reduced forest cover is found near the reserve boundaries compared with their interiors, suggesting a more degraded environment near the edge of the protected areas. A fully protected reserve, Kakum National Park, showed little forest cover change compared with many other less protected reserves (such as a production reserve—Subri River). Anthropogenic activities, such as mining, agriculture, and built area expansion, were the main land-use transitions from forest. The reserves and census districts that are located near large-scale open pit mining indicated the most drastic forest loss. No significant correlation was found between the magnitudes of forest cover change and population density change for reserves and within a 1.5-km buffer surrounding the reserves. While other anthropogenic factors should be explored in relation to deforestation, our qualitative analysis revealed that reserve protection status (management policies) appears to be an important factor. The mapping approach described in this study provided a highly accurate and effective means to monitor land-use changes in forested and cloud-prone regions with great promise for application to improved monitoring of moist tropical and other forests characterized by high cloud cover.                          © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deforestation;

This is almost certainly due to an increase in the number of undocumented immigrants using the area as a gateway to the interior of the United States. In this research, we use the tools of geographic information systems (GIS) to measure the scope and extent of this impact, focusing on the creation of illegal trails and the impact of illegal campsites and campfires on the environment of the Descanso Ranger District within the national forest. Our findings suggest that between the start of Operation Gatekeeper in late 1994 and the end of the study period in 1999, there were 772 meters of new trail created per 1,000 unauthorized immigrants, accompanied by 656 square meters of area disturbed per 1,000 immigrants, fifty kilograms of litter left behind per 1,000 immigrants, eleven illegal campfires per 1,000 immigrants, and 1.7 hectares burned by wildfires attributed to illegal immigrants. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Although several remote sensing techniques have been used successfully for urban change analysis, most of these focus on change 'between' classes measured in a discrete, crisp way through which each pixel is assigned to a label indicating either a change or no change in the class to which the pixel originally belonged. In many major cities, such as Cairo, change also occurs within classes (e.g. vertical growth of buildings, increase in housing density, decrease in open spaces) and is reflected by an aggregation of land cover and urban materials. None of these materials may seem important in isolation. Rather, the significance of these urban land covers arises from the way they interweave with each other to structure the morphology of the urban place. In this paper, a 'soft' approach is presented to identify and measure the composition of changing morphology from multi-temporal, multi-spectral satellite images. SMA is demonstrated to be capable of deriving spatially continuous variables quantified at the sub-pixel level. These variables represent measures that can be compared across urban places and at different time periods. They can be integrated readily into a wide range of applications and models concerned with physical, economic and/or socio-demographic phenomena in the city. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","Africa; Cairo [Egypt]; Eastern Hemisphere; Egypt; North Africa; World; Economic and social effects; Mathematical models; Remote sensing; Satellites; Spectrum analysis; Multi-spectral satellite images; Spectral mixture analysis (SMA); Urban morphology; Urban places; image analysis; land use change; metropolitan area; pixel; remote sensing; spectral analysis; urban morphology; Urban planning","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (BCS-0095641); Andrew W.

It is likely, however, that most people experience climate change in situ, so understanding the role of population dynamics remains critical. How a given number of people, in a given location and with varying population characteristics may exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change or how, conversely, they may be vulnerable to climate change impacts are basic questions that remain largely unresolved [6]. This paper explores where and to what extent population dynamics intersect with high exposure to climate change. Specifically, in Eastern Africa's Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), a climate change/health vulnerability hotspot we have identified in prior research [7], we model child undernutrition vulnerability indices based on climate variables, including proxy measures (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery, at a 5-km spatial resolution. Results suggest that vegetation changes associated with precipitation decline in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa can help predict deteriorating child health. © 2016 IEEE.","Climate; Lake Victoria Basin (LVB); NDVI; stunting; undernutrition; vulnerability","East African Lakes; Lake Victoria; Climate models; Dynamics; Lakes; Population dynamics; Satellite imagery; Surveys; Climate change impact; Complex relationships; Population characteristics; Precipitation data; Socioeconomic aspects; Spatial resolution; Sub-saharan africa; Vulnerability index; child health; climate effect; health survey; NDVI; nutritional status; population dynamics; precipitation assessment; spatial analysis; vulnerability; Climate change","","","","","","","Waterlow J.C., Introduction.

The most recent (2008) Ghana Demographic and Health Survey estimates the TFR in the Greater Accra Region to be down to 2.5 (compared to 4.0 for the country as a whole). Within the core metropolis of the Greater Accra Region—the Accra Metropolitan Assembly or Accra Metropolis, our data (described below) suggest that fertility has dropped to near replacement level as of 2008–2009. Within Accra, as throughout the nation, this has been accomplished especially through a delay in marriage and reductions in exposure within marriage, accompanied by an increase in the use of abortion and modern contraceptives. At the same time, reported levels of abortion and contraceptive utilization remain substantially below what would be expected in order to achieve Accra’s low fertility. Thus, the exact proximate determinants of the decline remain a bit murky. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fertility Decline; Fertility Level; Fertility Transition; Geographically Weighted Regression; Total Fertility Rate","","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; United States Agency for International Development, USAID; World Health Organization, WHO; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Funding text 1: This research was funded in part by grant number R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“Health, Poverty and Place in Accra, Ghana,” John R.

Previous studies have not identified a variable distance effect on malaria prevalence from UA.This study examines the relationships between self-reported malaria information for 3,164 women surveyed in Accra, Ghana, in 2003, and both household characteristics and proximity to sites of UA. Malaria self-reports are associated with age, education, overall health, socioeconomic status, and solid waste disposal method. The odds of self-reported malaria are significantly higher for women living within 1 km of UA compared with all women living near an irrigation source, the association disappearing beyond this critical distance. Malaria prevalence is often elevated in communities within 1 km of UA despite more favorable socioeconomic characteristics than communities beyond 1 km. Neighborhoods within 1 km of UA should be reconsidered as a priority for malaria-related care.

We evaluated psychosocial, built-environmental, and policy-related correlates of adolescents' indoor tanning use. Methods. We developed 5 discrete data sets in the 100 most populous US cities, based on interviews of 6125 adolescents (aged 14-17 years) and their parents, analysis of state indoor tanning laws, interviews with enforcement experts, computed density of tanning facilities, and evaluations of these 3399 facilities' practices regarding access by youths. After univariate analyses, we constructed multilevel models with generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Results. In the past year, 17.1% of girls and 3.2% of boys had used indoor tanning. The GLMMs indicated that several psychosocial or demographic variables significantly predicted use, including being female, older, and White; having a larger allowance and a parent who used indoor tanning and allowed their adolescent to use it; and holding certain beliefs about indoor tanning's consequences. Living within 2 miles of a tanning facility also was a significant predictor. Residing in a state with youth-access legislation was not significantly associated with use. Conclusions. Current laws appear ineffective in reducing indoor tanning; bans likely are needed. Parents have an important role in prevention efforts.","","Adolescent; Age Factors; California; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Psychology; Public Policy; Residence Characteristics;

Geographic information systems (GIS) enable users to simultaneously display a number of environmental data layers and use spatial statistics to explore the relationships between contextual and individual-level variables. This makes GIS a potentially powerful tool in substance use research. One area where geography has a striking influence on health is at the US/Mexico border, where the confluence of drug trafficking routes, migration, and income inequalities form unique environmental influences on drug use scenes. In this chapter, we describe some of the spatial and environmental issues, such as migration, neighborhood characteristics, and proximity to services, which may affect drug use behaviors and risks. A number of practical methods to measure geographical indicators are also described, focusing on a case study of injection drug use in the Mexico/US border city of Tijuana, Mexico. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Netherlands","","","","","","","978-140208508-6","","","English","Geogr. and Drug Addict.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855518038"

Based on requirements from several fields of scientific inquiry, Nightsat should be capable of producing a complete cloud-free global map of lights on an annual basis. We have used a combination of high-resolution field spectra of outdoor lighting, moderate resolution colour photography of cities at night from the International Space Station, and high-resolution airborne camera imagery acquired at night to define a range of spatial, spectral, and detection limit options for a future Nightsat mission. The primary findings of our study are that Nightsat should collect data from a near-synchronous orbit in the early evening with 50 to 100 m spatial resolution and have detection limits of 2.5E-8Watts cm-2sr-1 m-1 or better. Although panchromatic low-light imaging data would be useful, multispectral low-light imaging data would provide valuable information on the type or character of lighting; potentially stronger predictors of variables such as ambient population density and economic activity; and valuable information to predict response of other species to artificial night lighting. The Nightsat mission concept is unique in its focus on observing a human activity, in contrast to traditional Earth observing systems that focus on natural systems.","","Geographic information systems; Imaging systems; Mapping; Satellite imagery; Global map; Global observation; High-resolution airborne camera imagery; airborne sensing; human settlement; multispectral image; photography; satellite mission; spatial resolution; Remote sensing","","","","","Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologia dell; NASA Johnson Spaceflight Center; NOAA-NESDIS; World Health Organization; Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University; University of Southern California; Ames Research Center; San Diego State University; University of Denver; University of Colorado; Flinders University","{Earth Observation Group, NOAA-NESDIS National Geophysical Data Center, Boulder, Colorado 80305, USA {Dipartimento di Astronomia, Università di Padova, Padova 2-35122, Italy §Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologia dell’Inquinamento Luminoso (ISTIL), Thiene 13-36016, Italy ""NASA Johnson Spaceflight Center, Houston, Texas 77058, USA **Cirrus Digital Systems, Tiburon, California 94920, USA {{Department of Geography, University of Denver, Denver, Colorado 80208, USA; Department of Geography, Population and Environmental Management, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia {{Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, Palisades, New York 10964-8000, USA §§NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California 94035, USA """"The Urban Wildlands Group, P.O.

This paper proposes an alternative classification scheme for urban mapping based on a gradient approach for the southern portion of the West African country of Ghana. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM. +) and European Remote Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are used to generate a pattern based definition of the urban context. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is used to classify a Landsat scene into Built, Vegetation and Other land covers. Landscape metrics are estimated for Built and Vegetation land covers for a 450 m uniform grid covering the study area. A measure of texture is extracted from the SAR imagery and classified as Built/Non-built. SMA based measures of Built and Vegetation fragmentation are combined with SAR texture based Built/Non-built maps through a decision tree classifier to generate a nine class urban context map capturing the transition from unsettled land at one end of the gradient to the compact urban core at the other end. Training and testing of the decision tree classifier was done using very high spatial resolution reference imagery from Google Earth. An overall classification agreement of 77% was determined for the nine-class urban context map, with user's accuracy (commission errors) being lower than producer's accuracy (omission errors). Nine urban contexts were classified and then compared with data from the 2000 Census of Ghana. Results suggest that the urban classes appropriately differentiate areas along the urban gradient. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Landscape pattern; Urban gradient; Urban mapping","Ghana; Decision trees; Geodetic satellites; Mapping; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Urban planning; Vegetation; Decision tree classifiers; Enhanced thematic mappers; European remote sensing satellites; Landscape pattern; Spectral mixture analysis; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Urban mapping; Very high spatial resolutions; ERS; GIS; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; landscape change; mapping method; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; urban area; urban growth; Urban growth","","","","","National Aeronautic and Space Administration Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science Program, (G00009708); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This research was funded by grant number R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and by National Aeronautic and Space Administration Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science Program grant G00009708 .

The nonspatial variables are available directly from censuses but the spatial component requires an accurate location of the villages to which the census data refer and then appropriate decomposition of the data into spatial and nonspatial components. We use IRS satellite imagery to classify the built area in a rural governorate in Egypt and then assign village-level census data to the centroids of those polygons and incorporate the data into a GIS. We then employ measures of global and local spatial statistics to conclude that in 1976 the combination of female illiteracy, proportion married, and spatial clustering accounted for 39% of the variation in fertility in Menoufia. In 1986 those same factors explained 51% of the variation in fertility. In 1976 about one third and in 1986 about half of the explained variability was due to the spatial component ('diffusion') and the other half due to a combination of demographic characteristics. Furthermore, between 1976 and 1986 there was a clear north-to-south drift of fertility, with lower fertility being clustered in the north and higher fertility clustered in the south.","","Egypt; Menoufia; fertility; GIS; remote sensing; spatial variation","","","","","","","Arriaga E.E., Population Analysis With Microcomputers, (1994); Bracken I., Martin D., Linkage of the 1981 and 1991 UK Censuses using surface modelling concepts, Environment and Planning A, 27, pp. 379-390, (1995); Chen D., Getis A., Point Pattern Analysis (PPA), (1998); Chesnais J.-C., The Demographic Transition: States, Patterns, and Economic Implications, (1992); Chou Y.-H., Exploring Spatial Analysis in Geographic Information Systems, (1996); Cleland J., Wilson C., Demand theories of the fertility transition: An iconoclastic view, Population Studies, 41, pp. 5-30, (1987); Cliff A.D., Ord J.K., Spatial Processes: Models and Applications, (1981); Coale A., The demographic transition, International Population Conference, Liege 1973, 1, pp. 53-72, (1973); Davis K., The world demographic transition, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 237, pp. 1-11, (1945); Davis K., The theory of change and response in modern demographic history, Population Index, 29, pp. 345-366, (1963); Easterlin R., Crimmins E., The Fertility Revolution: A Supply - Demand Analysis, (1985); Entwisle B., Casterline J., Sayed H.A.-A., Villages as contexts for contraceptive behavior in rural Egypt, American Sociological Review, 54, pp. 1019-1034, (1989); Firebaugh G., Structural determinants of urbanization in Asia and Latin America, 1950-1970, American Sociological Review, 44, pp. 199-215, (1979); Gadalla S., Is There Hope?

During the study period 1.5% of the study area transitioned to Built, an increase of 56% Built area since 2000, while population increased by 33%. Most (84% of total study area) of this change to Built involved conversion from Agriculture al land use and occurred predominantly in suburban and periurban areas zones of the Accra and Kumasi metropolitan areas. While total population and amount of Built LCLU variables co-vary strongly at the census district level at the beginning and end of the study period, change in population and Built are less strongly correlated. In fact, we observe that new Built development increased at a greater rate than population growth within peri-urban areas of Accra and Kumasi, frequently occurring as spaced residential land use composed of large houses with minimal urban infrastructure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Ghana; Land cover and land use change; Landsat; Population growth; Urbanization","Ghana; land cover; land use change; Landsat; metropolitan area; population growth; urbanization","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (G00009708)","This work was supported by the Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science (IDS) program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NASA award number G00009708 .

The urban environment can be defined by classifying images and then combining that information with census data to create a quantitative index of the urban-rural continuum. This is based on the premise that variability in the built environment is associated with variability in human behavior, and that this variability captures the nature of urbanness in human societies. The chapter begins with a justification of the use of the built environment as a signature of urban places. It continues with an overview of how satellite images can be used to distill information about the urban environment, and of the role that geographic information systems (GIS) play in the analysis. It then illustrates this approach to understanding the urbanness of places using data from Egypt. Variables derived from satellite images are combined with census data to improve our understanding of the spatial variability in human behavior in the context of the urban-rural continuum. Finally, ways in which this type of analysis could be used to measure and understand phenomena such as urban sprawl and multinucleation of metropolitan areas are suggested. © 2004 Tony Champion and Graeme Hugo.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-135191496-3; 978-075463588-8","","","English","New Forms of Urbanization: Beyond the Urban-Rural Dichotomy","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082629695"

While gendered beliefs promoting motherhood are a known risk factor, their association with adolescent childbirth within the social networks of Central American communities is unknown. Methods This was a cross-sectional study looking at adolescent childbirth amongst women ages 15-20 years (N = 2990) in rural Honduras, using reproductive health data on all individuals ≥15 years of age (N = 24 937 of 31 300 population) including social network contacts, all of whom were interviewed as part of the study. The outcome, adolescent childbirth, was defined as having had a child < age 20 years. Predictors included whether a woman's social contact had an adolescent childbirth and the social contact's reported perception of community support for adolescent childbirth. Results While girls who identified a father in the village as a social contact had a lower likelihood of adolescent childbirth regardless of whether or not they reported being in a partnership, this finding did not hold for girls who identified mothers. There was an association between a social contact's report of norms supporting adolescent childbirth and a girl's risk of adolescent childbirth; however, village-level aggregate norms attenuated that relationship. Independent significant associations were found between a girl's risk of adolescent childbirth and both a social contact's adolescent childbirth and the village proportion of women who had had an adolescent childbirth. The association between social contacts' adolescent childbirth and a girl's risk of adolescent childbirth across relationships was more robust for stronger relationships and when the social contact was closer in age to the girl. Conclusions If, as this evidence suggests, a strong driver of adolescent childbirth is the frequency of the occurrence of adolescent childbirth both within the greater community and within a girl's proximal social network, the challenge for intervention strategies is to encourage norms that prevent adolescent childbirth without stigmatising those who have had an adolescent childbirth. Programmatic efforts to counter prevailing norms that limit a woman's role to motherhood, and that support and encourage strong norms for girls' education may play an important role in addressing this situation. © 2020 The Author(s).","","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fathers; Female; Honduras; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Reproductive Health; Rural Population; Social Networking; Stereotyping; Young Adult; adolescent; adolescent pregnancy; adult; age; cross-sectional study; father; female; Honduras; human; pregnancy; reproductive health; rural population; social network; stereotyping; young adult","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (K01HD087551); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1098684); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Funding: Funding provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, grant number OPP1098684, and NICHD grant number K01HD087551.","Neal S., Harvey C., Chandra-Mouli V., Caffe S., Camacho A.V., Trends in adolescent first births in five countries in Latin America and the Caribbean: Disaggregated data from demographic and health surveys, Reprod Health, 15, (2018); Caffe S., Plesons M., Camacho A.V., Brumana L., Abdool S.N., Huaynoca S., Et al., Looking back and moving forward: Can we accelerate progress on adolescent pregnancy in the Americas, Reprod Health, 14, (2017); Sabonge K., Wulf D., Remez L., Prada E., Drescher J., Early childbearing in Honduras: A continuing challenge, (2006); Statcompiler, (2016); Azevedo J.P., Lopez-Calva L.F., Perova E., Is the baby to blame?: An inquiry into the consequences of early childbearing; Goicolea I., Marianne W., Ohman A., San Sebastian M., Risk factors for pregnancy among adolescent girls in Ecuador's Amazon basin: A case-control study, Rev Panam Salud Publica, 26, pp. 221-228, (2009); Guijarro S., Naranjo J., Padilla M., Gutierez R., Lammers C., Blum R.W., Family risk factors associated with adolescent pregnancy: Study of a group of adolescent girls and their families in Ecuador, J Adolesc Health, 25, pp. 166-172, (1999); Secretaría de Salud [Honduras], Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) e ICF International, Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Demografía 2011-2012, (2013); Shakya H.B., Weeks J., Christakis N.A., Do village-level normative and network factors help explain spatial variability in adolescent childbearing in rural Honduras?, Social Science & Medicine Population Health; Rodriguez J., High adolescent fertility in the context of declining fertility in Latin America, (2011); Angelini V., Mierau J., Late-life health effects of teenage motherhood, Demogr Res, 39, pp. 1081-1104, (2018); Ganchimeg T., Ota E., Morisaki N., Laopaiboon M., Lumbiganon P., Zhang J., Et al., Pregnancy and childbirth outcomes among adolescent mothers: A World Health Organization multicountry study, BJOG, 121, pp. 40-48, (2014); Sagili H., Pramya N., Prabhu K., Mascarenhas M., Rani P.R., Are teenage pregnancies at high risk?

Yet issues of spatial heterogeneity in these complex environments may obscure unique elements of neighborhood life that may be protective or harmful to human health. Resident perceptions of neighborhood effects on health may help to fill gaps in our interpretation of household survey results and better inform how to plan and execute neighborhood-level health interventions. Objective: We evaluate differences in housing and socioeconomic indicators and health, environment, and neighborhood perceptions derived from the analysis of a household survey and a series of focus groups in Accra, Ghana. We then explore how neighborhood perceptions can inform survey results and ultimately neighborhood-level health interventions. Design: Eleven focus groups were conducted across a socioeconomically stratified sample of neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana. General inductive themes from the focus groups were analyzed in tandem with data collected in a 2009 household survey of 2,814 women. In-depth vignettes expand upon the three most salient emergent themes. Results: Household and socioeconomic characteristics derived from the focus groups corroborated findings from the survey data. Focus group and survey results diverged for three complex health issues: malaria, health-care access, and sense of personal agency in promoting good health. Conclusion: Three vignettes reflecting community views about malaria, health-care access, and sense of personal agency in promoting good health highlight the challenges facing community health interventions in Accra and exemplify how qualitatively derived neighborhood-level health effects can help shape health interventions. © 2015 Marta M.

While there are many reasons for the fact that fertility decline is slow in Africa, we hypothesize that the relationship between fertility and urbanization is obscured by the fact that urbanization takes place along a gradient. In the most urban places (e.g., neighborhoods of the largest cities), fertility is apt to be very low, but most urban residents are residing in places that are somewhere along a continuum from completely rural to the most urban possible. All previous attempts to define that urban gradient and relate it to fertility levels rely in one form or another on census data. Because sub-Saharan-African countries are among the least prolific in terms of census gathering, a measure that relies solely on satellite imagery to gage a place's position along the urban gradient could be extremely useful. This paper describes a methodology for doing this and then uses data from the West African country of Ghana to examine how spatial patterns of land cover are associated with fertility. Satellite imagery and landscape metrics are used to create an urban context definition based on landscape patterns using a gradient approach. Census data are used to model the association between urban context and fertility through ordinary least square regression and spatial autoregressive models. Results indicate that there are significant differences in fertility between different urban contexts.

This paper examines patterns of fertility among these refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who have exhibited high levels of reproduction since their arrival. Data are drawn from sample surveys in San Diego and San Francisco, CA. Fertility levels were found to exceed five chidren per ever-married woman, a level that is consistent with perceptions of ideal family size in the homeland. Fertility levels were significantly higher among rural second-wave refugees than in the more urban first-wave groups. One explanation for the high fertility is that couples have migrated from areas where fertility is high, and they have not yet adapted their reproductive behavior to the low fertility environment of the United States. This possibility is reinforced by a general gender preference for boys and exacerbated by the fact that, while a majority of women are aware of methods of fertility control, access is still limited by cultural and financial barriers, and the motivation to use family planning still appears to be relatively low. The data suggest that this refugee population will continue to put pressure on maternal and child health resources, and that continued residence in the United States could lead to desires to limit family size, thus increasing demand for methods of fertility control.","","Adult; Age Factors; Asian Americans; Attitude; Cambodia; Contraception; Female; Fertility; Human; Laos; Male; Pregnancy; Reproduction; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; United States; Urban Population; Vietnam; family planning; female; fertility; human; human experiment; male; pregnancy; priority journal; refugee; united states","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD015699)","","","","","","","","","","","00333539","","PHRPA","2495548","English","PUBLIC HEALTH REP.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024362362"

We develop and test approaches for semiautomatically and more frequently identifying the type and date of LCLUC from time series of Landsat ETM+ imagery from 2000 to 2014. Clouds, cloud shadows, and scan line corrector-off create missing data in ETM+ images. Forty-one dates of ETM+ images that partially contain missing data were utilized. The general approach is to conduct a per-pixel supervised classification on each image of a Landsat time series after masking missing data. Spatial, temporal, and logical filters are applied to correct for misclassification and missing data. Each image is classified into three general classes: 1) Built; 2) Natural Vegetation; 3) and Agriculture, with expansion of Built being our main focus. Reference data for Change-to- Built were independently selected from all available high-spatial resolution satellite images (e.g., Quickbird, GeoEye, Worldview, and Google Earth imagery), and the type and beginning time of LCLUC was recorded. Results show that the temporal-filtered product identified both the location and the start of Change-to-Built more precisely and accurately than the nonfiltered and other filtered products. Based on reference data, 40% of the Change-to-Built samples were correctly identified without filtering; whereas, when a temporal filter was applied, 80% were correctly identified with low amounts of false positive Change-to-Built pixels. The temporal-filtered product has the highest temporal precision and accuracy (mean time difference = 2.1years) in identifying the start of Change-to-Built. © 2015 IEEE.","imagery; Land cover and land use change (LCLUC); Landsat ETM+; multitemporal; time series","Ghana; Image classification; Land use; Pixels; Satellite imagery; Time series; Discrete analysis; High spatial resolution; Landsat time series; Misclassifications; Natural vegetation; Scan line correctors; Supervised classification; Temporal precision; image classification; land cover; land use change; Landsat thematic mapper; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; time series analysis; Time series analysis","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science Program, (G00009708)","This work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science Program under Grant G00009708.","Codjoe S.N.A., Integrating remote sensing, GIS, census, and socioeconomic data in studying the population-land use/cover nexus in Ghana: A literature update, Afr.

It is a population that is young, is experiencing high fertility, late onset of prenatal care, and is characterized by low socioeconomic status. Thus, it presents a high risk profile with respect to infant mortality. Using linked birth and infant death records for the San Diego metropolitan area for the period 1978-1985 infant mortality rates (IMRs) were calculated for Indochinese refugee groups from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in comparison with other ethnic groups. We found, surprisingly, that Indochinese refugees as a group had an IMR below that for non-Hispanic Whites and substantially below that for Blacks. In general, IMRs for Indochinese refugees were similar to those for other Asian groups. These findings held even after controlling for birth weight and onset of prenatal care. The timing and causes of death suggest areas in which the IMR could drop to even lower levels with improved community outreach programs, especially among refugee groups from Laos (Hmong and Lao) who exhibited the unusual pattern of higher post-early neonatal than early neonatal mortality. © 1991.","birth weight; Indochinese refugees; infant mortality; prenatal care","Birth Weight; California; Cambodia; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Human; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Laos; Prenatal Care; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Vietnam; USA, California, San Diego; ethnic refugees; fertility impact; immigrant group; Indochinese group; infant mortality; metropolitan area; population characteristics; prenatal care; socio-economic status; urban area; adaptation; article; birth weight; cambodia; caucasian; child death; comparative study; environmental factor; ethnic difference; ethnic group; fertility; fetus outcome; human; immigrant; infant; infant mortality; infant welfare; laos; negro; normal human; prenatal care; refugee; risk factor; social status; united states; viet nam","","","","","HealthC are Deliverya nd Assistance","Acknowledgements--Trheisse arcwh ass upportebdy Grant No. MCJ-060551fr omt heD ivisiono f Maternaal ndC hild Health,B ureauo f HealthC are Deliverya nd Assistance.

We use census data from Accra, Ghana, to create an index that applies the UN-Habitat criteria for a place to be a slum. We use this index to identify neighborhoods on a continuum of slum characteristics and on that basis are able to locate the worst slums in Accra. These do include the areas with a local reputation for being slums, lending qualitative validation to the index. We show that slums also have footprints that can be identified from data classified from satellite imagery. However, variability among slums in Accra is also associated with some variability in the land cover characteristics of slums. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.","Accra; Ghana; GIS; Remote sensing; Slums","Accra; Africa; Ghana; Greater Accra; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa; Geographic information systems; Satellite imagery; Urban planning; developing world; land cover; neighborhood; qualitative analysis; satellite imagery; urban population; Ghana; Slums; Remote sensing","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Acknowledgments This research was supported by grant number R21 HD046612-01 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

In this study we utilize spatial, structural, and contextual features (e.g., PanTex, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Line Support Regions, Hough transforms and others) calculated at multiple spatial scales from high spatial resolution satellite data to map slum areas and compare these estimates to three field based slum maps: one from the UN Habitat/Accra Metropolitan Assembly (UNAMA) and two census data derived maps based on the UN Habitat definition of a slum, a simple slum/non-slum dichotomy map, and a slum index map. When comparing the remotely sensed derived slum areas to the UNAMA slum definition results indicate an overall accuracy of 94.3% and a Kappa of 0.91. When compared to the dichotomous, census derived slum maps the results are not as accurate. This reduced accuracy is due to the substantial over prediction of slums, especially if only one criterion was missing, using the census data. In relation to the slum index, the remote sensing estimates of slums were significantly correlated with an r2 of 0.45 and when population density was taken into account, the correlation increased to an r2 of 0.78. Overall, the remote sensing methodology provides a reasonable estimate of slum areas and variations within the city. © 2015 IEEE.","","Ecosystems; Hough transforms; Housing; Maps; Population statistics; Surveys; Contextual feature; High spatial resolution; Histogram of oriented gradients; Overall accuracies; Population densities; Spatial extent; Spatial features; Support regions; Remote sensing","","","","","","","Tools and Methods for Estimating Population at Risk from Natural Disasters and Complex Humanitarian Crises, (2007); Graesser J., Cheriyadat A., Vatsavai R.R., Chandola V., Long J., Bright E., Image based characterization of formal and informal neighborhoods in an urban landscape, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 5, 4, pp. 1164-1176, (2012); Weeks J.R., Hill A., Stow D., Getis A., Fugate D., Can we spot a neighborhood from the air?

The Time Use and Health Study in Accra collected information on incomes, current health status, and health care use from 5,484 persons in 1,250 households, each repeatedly sampled on a rolling basis for a period of 13 weeks. Data collection took place during September 2008-March 2010 to capture seasonal variations. The study found that incomes varied widely between households, and that a high fraction of persons lived below the poverty line. Despite this level of income poverty and an overall remarkably high burden of treatable disease, no systematic differences in self-reported and objectively measured health conditions were detected across socioeconomic groups.

However, the expansion of cities in sub-Saharan Africa is following a different trajectory than cities in the rest of the world, especially in Europe and North America. Indeed, urbanization on the African subcontinent has not been preceded by economic development and industrialization. The objective of this study is to improve our understanding of the process of urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa by comparing and contrasting two major cities of Ghana, Accra and Kumasi. We combined remote sensing methods and spatial metrics to compare the growth, built-up density, land use composition, and fragmentation of Accra and Kumasi between 2000 and 2010. Results show that Accra and Kumasi grew at an annual rate of 4.5% and 6% respectively. Residential land use constituted the major addition in both cities. Accra, the capital city of Ghana, added the most non-residential built-up land. Moreover, growth in both cities was compact, with new built-up land use occurring adjacent to existing urban land at the beginning of the study period in 2000. Finally, the urban-rural interface located within a 2 km buffer beyond the urban core experienced the greatest amount of fragmentation between 2000 and 2010 for both cities. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Ghana; land cover; land use; remote sensing; spatial metrics; Urbanization","","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (G00009708)","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [Grant Number: G00009708].","Aguilera F., Valenzuela L.M., Botequilha-Leitao A., Landscape metrics in the analysis of urban land use patterns: a case study in a Spanish metropolitan area, Landsc Urban Plan, 99, 3-4, pp. 226-238, (2011); Benza M., Weeks J.R., Stow D.A., Lopez-Carr D., Clarke K.C., A pattern-based definition of urban context using remote sensing and GIS, Remote Sens Environ, 183, pp. 250-264, (2016); Cohen B., Urbanization in developing countries: current trends, future projections, and key challenges for sustainability, Technol Soc, 28, 1-2, pp. 63-80, (2006); Dickson K.B., The Ghanaian town: its nature and function, (1971); Doan P., Oduro C.Y., Patterns of population growth in peri‐urban Accra, Ghana, Int J Urban Reg Res, 36, 6, pp. 1306-1325, (2012); Herold M., Couclelis H., Clarke K.C., The role of spatial metrics in the analysis and modeling of urban land use change, Comput Environ Urban Syst, 29, 4, pp. 369-399, (2005); Hess J.B., Imagining architecture: the structure of nationalism in Accra, Ghana, Africa Today, 47, 2, pp. 35-58, (2000); McGarigal K., Cushman S.A., Ene E., FRAGSTATS v4: Spatial Pattern Analysis Program for Categorical and Continuous Maps, (2012); Montgomery M.R., The urban transformation of the developing world, Science, 319, 5864, pp. 761-764, (2008); Oduro C.Y., Ocloo K., Peprah C., Analyzing growth patterns of Greater Kumasi metropolitan area using GIS and multiple regression techniques, J Sustain Dev, 7, 5, (2014); Owusu G., Indigenes’ and migrants’ access to land in peri-urban areas of Accra, Ghana, Int Dev Planning Rev, 30, 2, pp. 177-198, (2008); Owusu G., Agyei-Mensah S., A comparative study of ethnic residential segregation in Ghana’s two largest cities, Accra and Kumasi, Popul Environ, 32, 4, pp. 332-352, (2011); Owusu G., Yankson P.W., (2017); Schneider A., Woodcock C.E., Compact, dispersed, fragmented, extensive?

This would suggest that in Egypt we would find that Cairo was well ahead of the rest of the nation in its fertility transition. The data suggest otherwise and highlight the fact that many parts of Cairo are still experiencing high levels of fertility. Population geographers have generally examined differences only between urban and nonurban areas, but incorporating census tract level data from the 1996 and 1986 censuses of Egypt into a geographic information system, we are able to show that there are substantial intraurban geographic variations in fertility within the greater Cairo area. These spatial patterns are indicative of underlying clusters of differences in human reproduction that have important implications for understanding the decline of fertility within Cairo and the spread of that decline throughout the remainder of Egypt. © 2004 by Association of American Geographers.","Cairo; Egypt; Fertility transition; Geographic information systems (GIS); Spatial analysis","Africa; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt; North Africa; demographic transition; GIS; spatial analysis; urban population","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Andrew W.

Because local geography influences disease risk, we explored the spatial distribution of HIV among injection drug users (IDUs). From 2006-2007, 1,056 IDUs were recruited using respondent-driven sampling and then followed for eighteen months. Participants underwent semiannual surveys, mapping, and testing for HIV, tuberculosis, and syphilis. Using average nearest neighbor and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics, locations where participants lived, worked, bought drugs, and injected drugs were compared with HIV status and environmental and behavioral factors. Median age was thirty-seven years; 85 percent were male. Females had higher HIV prevalence than males (10.2 percent vs. 3.4 percent; p = 0.001). HIV cases at baseline (n = 47) most strongly clustered by drug injection sites (Z score = -6.173, p < 0.001), with a 16-km 2 hotspot near the Mexico-U.S. border, encompassing the red-light district. Spatial correlates of HIV included syphilis infection, female gender, younger age, increased hours on the street per day, and higher number of injection partners. Almost all HIV seroconverters injected within a 2.5-block radius of each other immediately prior to seroconversion. Only history of syphilis infection and female gender were strongly associated with HIV in the area where incident cases injected. Directional trends suggested a largely static epidemic until July through December 2008, when HIV spread to the southeast, possibly related to intensified violence and policing that spiked in the latter half of 2008. Although clustering allows for targeting interventions, the dynamic nature of epidemics suggests the importance of mobile treatment and harm reduction programs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","HIV;

MESMA models mixed pixels as linear combinations of pure spectra, called endmembers, while allowing the types and number of endmembers to vary on a per-pixel basis. A total of 63 two-, three-, and four-endmember models were applied to a Landsat TM image for Los Angeles County, and a smaller subset of these models was chosen based on fraction and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) criteria. From this subset, an optimal model was selected for each pixel based on optimization for maximum area coverage. The resultant endmember fractions were then mapped into four main components of urban land cover: Vegetation, Impervious surfaces, Soil, and Water/Shade. The mapped fractions were validated using aerial photos. The results showed that a majority of the image could be modeled successfully with two- or three-endmember models. The validation results indicated the robustness of MESMA for deriving spatially continuous variables quantified at the sub-pixel level. These parameters can be readily integrated into a wide range of applications and models concerned with physical, economic, and/or socio-demographic phenomena that influence the morphological patterns of the city.","","California; Los Angeles; United States; Data reduction; Mapping; Morphology; Demography; image classification; Landsat thematic mapper; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; urban morphology; Photogrammetry","","","","","","","Adams J.B., Smith M.O., Johnston P.E., Spectral mixture modeling: A new analysis of rock and soil types at the Viking Lander site, Journal of Geophysical Research, 91, pp. 8098-8112, (1986); Adams J.B., Smith M.O., Gillespie A.R., Imaging spectroscopy: Interpretation based on spectral mixture analysis, Remote Geochemical Analysis: Elemental and Mineralogical Composition, pp. 145-166, (1993); Allen J.P., Turner E., The Ethnic Quilt: Population Diversity in Southern California, (1997); Boardman J.W., Kruse F.A., Green R.O., Mapping target signatures via partial unmixing of AVIRIS data, Summaries of the Fifth JPL Airborne Earth Science Workshop, pp. 23-26, (1995); Church R.L., ReVelle C.T., The maximal covering location problem, Papers of Regional Science Association, 32, pp. 101-118, (1974); Elmore A.J., Mustard J.F., Manning S.J., Lobell D.B., Quantifying vegetation change in semiarid environments: Precision and accuracy of spectral mixture analysis and the normalized difference vegetation index, Remote Sensing of Environment, 73, pp. 87-102, (2000); Forster B.C., An examination of some problems and solutions in monitoring urban areas from satellite platforms, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 6, 1, pp. 139-151, (1985); Gordon P., Richardson H.W., Review essay: Los Angeles, city of angels?

Design/methodology/approach A multimethod approach is used which comprises quadrant analysis, ANOVA tests and structural equation modeling techniques. A questionnaire was designed for data collection. Findings The main finding is the support found for the proposed model at different scales. Results of the multimethod approach provide specific guidelines to departments using this approach to improve student learning outcomes and satisfaction. Practical implications The paper provides a conceptual model and supporting tools that can be used by other academic departments or higher education institutions to assist in the evaluation of how students perceive their learning outcomes and satisfaction with their undergraduate program. Originality/value The value of this multimethod approach is that it is simple to implement, and at the same time provides a richness of information for diagnosis and decisionmaking. The model was tested with data collected in different undergraduate programs and different countries, allowing the authors not only to find support for the model, but also to consider cultural differences among student perceptions. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Assessment; Gap analysis; Learning; Spain; Students","","","","","","","","Andreassen T.W., Lindestad B., Customer loyalty and complex services: the impact of corporate image on quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty for customers with varying degrees of service expertise, International Journal of Service Industry Management, 9, 1, pp. 7-23, (1998); Astin A.W., Student involvement: a developmental theory for higher education, Journal of College Student Development, 40, 5, pp. 518-529, (1999); Bitner M.J., Hubbert A.R., Rust R.T., Oliver R.L., Encounter satisfaction versus overall satisfaction versus quality, Service Quality: New Directions in Theory and Practice, pp. 72-94, (1994); Bitner M.J., Faranda W.T., Hubbert A.R., Zeithaml V.A., Customer contributions and roles in service delivery, International Journal of Service Industry Management, 8, 3, pp. 193-205, (1997); Braxton J., Reworking the Student Department Puzzle, (2000); Bryant B.E., Van Amburg D., Federal agencies government-wide customer satisfaction report for the general services administration, (2000); Chin W.W., PLS-Graph User's Guide.

Understanding the role of population dynamics remains critical. How a given number of people, in a given location and with varying population characteristics may exacerbate or mitigate the impacts of climate change or how, conversely, they may be vulnerable to climate change impacts are basic questions that remain largely unresolved [4]. This paper explores where and to what extent population dynamics intersect with high exposure to climate change. Specifically, in Eastern Africa's Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), a climate change/health vulnerability hotspot we have identified in prior research [5], we model child malnutrition vulnerability indices based on climate variables at a 5km spatial resolution. © 2015 IEEE.","climate; LVB; malnutrition; stunting; vulnerability","","","","","","","","Waterlow J.C., Introduction.

Our purpose in this article is to evaluate the way in which neighborhood context might shape reproductive behavior in Accra. In the process, we introduce several important innovations to the understanding of intraurban fertility levels in a sub-Saharan African city: (1) Despite the near explosion of work on neighborhoods as a spatial unit of analysis, very little of this research has been conducted outside of the richer countries; (2) we characterize neighborhoods on the basis of local knowledge of what we call vernacular neighborhoods; (3) we then define what we call organic neighborhoods using a new clustering tool-the AMOEBA algorithm-to create these neighborhoods; and (4) we then we evaluate and explain which of the neighborhood concepts has the largest measurable contextual effect on an individual woman's reproductive behavior. Multilevel regression analysis suggests that vernacular neighborhoods are more influential on a woman's decision to delay marriage, whereas the organic neighborhoods based on socioeconomic status better capture the factors that shape fertility decisions after marriage. © 2010 by Association of American Geographers.","Accra; AMOEBA; Fertility; Multilevel analysis; Neighborhoods","Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra; algorithm; fertility; innovation; marriage; neighborhood; population decline; population growth; regression analysis; reproductive behavior; socioeconomic status; womens health","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This research was supported by Grant R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

In Accra, Ghana, municipal water is rationed to meet demand, and the gap in water services is increasingly being filled by private water vendors selling packaged ""sachet"" water. Sachets extend drinking water coverage deeper into low-income areas and alleviate the need for safe water storage, potentially introducing a health benefit over stored tap water. We explore correlates of using sachets as the primary drinking water source for 2093 women in 37 census areas classified as slums by UN-Habitat, and links between sachet water and reported diarrhea episodes in a subset of 810 children under five. We find that neighborhood rationing exerts a strong effect on a household's likelihood of buying sachet water, and that sachet customers tend to be the poorest of the poor. Sachet use is also associated with higher levels of self-reported overall health in women, and lower likelihood of diarrhea in children. We conclude with implications for sachet regulation in Accra and other sub-Saharan cities facing drinking water shortages. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Diarrhea; Drinking water; Poverty; Sachets; Sub-Saharan Africa","Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra; Sub-Saharan Africa; drinking water; sachet water; tap water; unclassified drug; diarrheal disease; drinking water; health impact; low income population; neighborhood; poverty; water supply; water use; adult; article; child; controlled study; diarrhea; female; Ghana; health status; human; lowest income group; male; poverty; priority journal; self report; storage; water management; water supply","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD054906); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This research was funded in part by Grant number R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“Health, Poverty and Place in Accra, Ghana,” John R.

We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature between 2004-2014 in order to: summarize recent seroprevalence estimates of Chagas disease among Latin American migrants, in both endemic and non-endemic settings; compare seroprevalence estimates in migrants to countrywide prevalence estimates; and identify risk factors for Chagas disease among migrants. A total of 320 studies were screened and 23 studies were included. We found evidence that the prevalence of Chagas disease is higher than expected in some migrant groups and that reliance on blood donor screening prevalence estimates underestimates the burden of disease. Overall there is a dearth of high quality epidemiologic studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in migrants, especially among intra-regional migrants within Latin America. Given that this zoonotic disease cannot likely be eradicated, improved surveillance and reporting is vital to continuing control efforts. More accurate health surveillance of both Latin American migrants and the Chagas disease burden will help countries appropriately scale up their response to this chronic disease. Overall, improved estimates of Chagas disease among migrants would likely serve to highlight the real need for better screening, diagnostics, and treatment of individuals living with the disease. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","American trypanosomiasis; Chagas disease; Immigration; Migration; Neglected tropical disease; Systematic review","Chagas Disease; Humans; Latin America; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Transients and Migrants; Latin America; Chagas disease; disease control; disease prevalence; disease treatment; epidemiology; health status; immigrant population; immigration; risk factor; Argentina; Article; Australia; blood donor; Brazil; Canada; Chagas disease; Chile; China; Colombia; cross-sectional study; disease eradication; Ecuador; El Salvador; endemic disease; ethnic group; France; health survey; Honduras; human; infection risk; Italy; Japan; Latin American; Mexico; migrant; Nicaragua; Peru; Portugal; risk factor; screening test; seroprevalence; South and Central America; Spain; Switzerland; systematic review; United Kingdom; United States; Chagas disease; migration; prevalence; risk factor","","","","","NIH-funded, (P30 AI036214); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, (T32DA023356); National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA; National Institute on Aging, NIA; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; National Cancer Institute, NCI; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (P30AI036214); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK; University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States, UC MEXUS; Center for AIDS Research, University of Washington, CFAR; University of California, San Diego, UCSD; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Funding text 1: Erin Conners was supported by a UC MEXUS dissertation research grant titled “The Potential Role of Migration in Chagas Disease Expansion” and the University of California, San Diego, Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH-funded program (P30 AI036214 ), which is supported by the following NIH Institutes and Centers: NIAID , NCI, NIMH, NIDA, NICHD, NHLBI, NIA, NIGMS, and NIDDK.; Funding text 2: Erin Conners was supported by a UC MEXUS dissertation research grant titled “The Potential Role of Migration in Chagas Disease Expansion” and the University of California, San Diego, Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH-funded program (P30 AI036214), which is supported by the following NIH Institutes and Centers: NIAID, NCI, NIMH, NIDA, NICHD, NHLBI, NIA, NIGMS, and NIDDK.","Alarcon de Noya B., Diaz-Bello Z., Colmenares C., Ruiz-Guevara R., Mauriello L., Zavala-Jaspe R., Suarez J.A., Abate T., Naranjo L., Paiva M., Rivas L., Castro J., Marques J., Mendoza I., Acquatella H., Torres J., Noya O., Large urban outbreak of orally acquired acute Chagas disease at a school in Caracas, Venezuela, J.

The objectives of this study were to analyze digital number histograms of image objects and evaluate classifications measures exploiting characteristic signatures of such histograms. Two histograms matching classifiers were evaluated and compared to the standard nearest neighbor to mean classifier. An ADS40 airborne multispectral image of San Diego, California was used for assessing the utility of curve matching classifiers in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach. The classifications were performed with data sets having 0.5 m, 2.5 m, and 5 m spatial resolutions. Results show that histograms are reliable features for characterizing classes. Also, both histogram matching classifiers consistently performed better than the one based on the standard nearest neighbor to mean rule. The highest classification accuracies were produced with images having 2.5 m spatial resolution. © 2013 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","","California; San Diego; United States; Classification (of information); Graphic methods; Image analysis; Land use; Central tendencies; Characteristic signature; Classification accuracy; Geographic object-based image analysis; Multispectral images; Object-based image classification; San Diego , California; Statistical measures; accuracy assessment; data set; histogram; image classification; land cover; land use; nearest neighbor analysis; spatial resolution; Image classification","","","","","","","Blashke T., Object based image analysis for remote sensing, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 65, pp. 2-16, (2009); Brunelli R., Milch O., Histograms analysis for image retrieval, Pattern Recognition, 34, pp. 1625-1637, (2001); Castilla G., Hay G.J., Ruiz J.R., Size-controlled region merging (SCRM): An automated delineation tool for assisted photointerpretation, Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, 74, 4, pp. 409-419, (2008); Cleve C., Kelly M., Kearns F.R., Moritz M., Classifi-cation of the wildland-urban interface: A comparison of pixeland object-based classifications using high-resolution aerial photography, Computers, Environments and Urban Systems, 32, pp. 317-326, (2008); Congalton R.G., Green K., Assessing the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Data: Principles and Practices, (2009); Coulter L., Stow D., Weeks J., Hope A., Tsou M., Jankowski P., A Border Security Spatial Decision Support System Driven by Remotely Sensed Data Inputs, (2009); Foody G., On the compensation for chance agreement in image classification accuracy assessment, Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, 47, 3, pp. 343-351, (1992); Goodchild M.F., Integrating GIS and remote sensing for vegetation analysis and modeling: Methodological issues, Journal of Vegetation Science, 5, pp. 615-626, (1994); Haralick R.M., Shapiro L.G., Image segmentation techniques, Computer Vision Graphics and Image Processing, 29, pp. 100-132, (1985); Kruse F.A., Lefkoff A.B., Boardman J.W., Heidebrecht K.B., Shapiro A.T., Barloon P., Goetz A.F.H., The spectral image processing system (SIPS)-Interactive visualization and analysis of imaging spectrometer data, Remote Sensing of Environment, 44, pp. 145-163, (1993); Mitchell S.W., Distance to second cluster as a measure of classification confidence, Remote Sensing of Environment, 112, 5, pp. 2615-2626, (2008); Pontius Jr. R.G., Millones M., Death to Kappa: Birth of quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement for accuracy assessment, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 32, 15, pp. 4407-4429, (2011); Qui G., Feng X., Fang J., Compression histogram representations for automatic colour photo categorization, Pattern Recognition, 37, pp. 2177-2193, (2004); Saykol E., Gudukbay U., Ulusoy O., A histogram-based approach for object-based query-by-shape-and-color in image and video databases, Image and Vision Computing, 23, pp. 1170-1180, (2005); Stow D., Toure S.I., Lippitt C.D., Lippitt C.L., Lee C., Frequency distribution signatures and classification of withinobject pixels, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 15, pp. 49-56, (2012); Swain M.J., Ballard D.H., Color indexing, International Journal of Computer Vision, 7, pp. 11-32, (1991); van der Meer F., The effectiveness of spectral similarity measures for the analysis of hyperspectral imagery, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 8, pp. 3-17, (2006); Walter F., Object-based classification of remote sensing data for change detection, Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, 58, 2, pp. 225-238, (2004); Wu S., Silvan-Cardenas J., Wang L., Per-field urban land use classification based on tax parcel boundaries, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 28, 12, pp. 2777-2801, (2007)","","","American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","00991112","","PERSD","","English","Photogramm.

Little is known, however, about the spatial or health characteristics of cities in this region or about the spatial inequalities in health within them. In this article we show how we have been creating a data-rich field laboratory in Accra, Ghana, to connect the dots between health, poverty, and place in a large city in West Africa. Our overarching goal is to test the hypothesis that satellite imagery, in combination with census and limited survey data, such as that found in demographic and health surveys (DHSs), can provide clues to the spatial distribution of health inequalities in cities where fewer data exist than those we have collected for Accra. To this end, we have created the first digital boundary file of the city, obtained high spatial resolution satellite imagery for two dates, collected data from a longitudinal panel of 3,200 women spatially distributed throughout Accra, and obtained microlevel data from the census. We have also acquired water, sewerage, and elevation layers and then coupled all of these data with extensive field research on the neighborhood structure of Accra. We show that the proportional abundance of vegetation in a neighborhood serves as a key indicator of local levels of health and well-being and that local perceptions of health risk are not always consistent with objective measures. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Africa; Ghana; health; neighborhood; remote sensing","Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra; demographic survey; health risk; health survey; informal settlement; neighborhood; population growth; poverty; public health; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; urban area","","","","","Medical School; School of Public Health; United States Agency for International Development, USAID; World Health Organization, WHO; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; University of Ghana, UG","This research was funded in part by grant number R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“Health, Poverty and Place in Accra, Ghana,” John R.

High-risk groups, particularly low-income immigrants from Mexico and Southeast Asia, show unexpectedly favorable perinatal outcomes and seem to be “superior health achievers”. Immigrant women overall were much less likely than the native-born to be in the labor force during their pregnancies: less than a quarter, compared to 42% of the US-born. Among the immigrants, this was especially the case among the Indochinese refugees, while Central American immigrant women were more likely to be in the job market than any other foreign-born group. The foregoing has documented significant differences in a wide range of maternal risk factors by nativity and ethnicity for the pregnant women in the Comprehensive Perinatal Program sample. A maximum-likelihood logistic regression analysis on this dichotomized dependent variable identified ten variables as significant determinants of infant health outcomes. © 1999 by Hiram E.

Determining the cause–effect relationship is challenging because the temporal resolution of population data is limited by decadal censuses for most countries. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship and relative timing between population change and land use change based on a case study of northern Taiwan from 1990 to 2015. A unique dataset on population was acquired from annually-updated governmental-based population registers maintained at the district level, and land-use expansion data (Residential, Employment, and Transportation Corridor categories) were derived from dense time series of Landsat imagery. Linear regression was applied to understand the general relationship between population and land use and their changes. The strongest relationships were found between population and areal extent of Residential land use, and between population change and Residential areal change. Lagged correlation analysis was implemented for identifying the time lag between population growth and land use change. Most districts exhibited Residential and Employment expansion prior to population growth, especially for districts in the periphery of metropolitan areas. Conversely, the core of metropolitan areas exhibited population growth prior to Residential and Employment expansion. Residential and Employment expansion were deemed to be drivers of population change, so population change was modeled with ordinary least square and geographically weighted regression with Residential and Employment expansion in both synchronized and time lag manners. Estimated population growth was found to be the most accurate when geographic differences and time lags from urban land use expansion were both incorporated. © 2022 by the authors.","land use change; population change; urbanization","","","","","","STUF United Fund Inc.; Yin Chin Foundation","This study was funded by Yin Chin Foundation from the USA, STUF United Fund Inc., the Long Jen-Yi Travel fund, the William and Vivian Finch Scholarship, and a doctoral stipend through San Diego State University.","Seto K.C., Fragkias M., Guneralp B., Reilly M.K., A Meta-Analysis of Global Urban Land Expansion, PLoS ONE, 6, (2011); Sustainable Cities, Human Mobility and International Migration: Report of the Secretary-General, (2018); Zhao M., Cheng C., Zhou Y., Li X., Shen S., Song C., A global dataset of annual urban extents (1992–2020) from harmonized nighttime lights, Earth Syst.

Two semi-automated feature detection approaches for detecting and mapping newly constructed buildings based on QuickBird very high spatial resolution satellite imagery were analyzed: (1) post-classification comparison; and (2) bi-temporal layerstack classification. Feature Analyst software based on a spatial contextual classifier and ENVI Feature Extraction that uses a true object-based image analysis approach of image segmentation and segment classification were evaluated. Final map products representing new building objects were compared and assessed for accuracy using two object-based accuracy measures, completeness and correctness. The bi-temporal layerstack method generated more accurate results compared to the post-classification comparison method due to less confusion with background objects. The spectral/spatial contextual approach (Feature Analyst) outperformed the true object-based feature delineation approach (ENVI Feature Extraction) due to its ability to more reliably delineate individual buildings of various sizes. Semi-automated, object-based detection followed by manual editing appears to be a reliable and efficient approach for detecting and enumerating new building objects. A bivariate regression analysis was performed using neighborhood-level estimates of new building density regressed on a census-derived measure of socio-economic status, yielding an inverse relationship with R 2 = 0.31 (n = 27; p = 0.00). The primary utility of the new building delineation results is to support spatial analyses of land cover and land use and demographic change. © 2011 by the authors.","Change detection; ENVI feature extraction; Feature analyst; New building delineation; Quickbird","Economics; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; Accuracy measures; Background objects; Bivariate; Change detection; Comparison methods; Demographic changes; Feature analyst; Feature delineation; Feature detection; High spatial resolution; Inverse relationship; Land cover; Multi-temporal; New building delineation; Object based; Object based image analysis; Post classification; Quickbird; QuickBird satellite imagery; Satellite image datas; Semi-automated; Socio-economic status; Software-based; Spatial analysis; Very high spatial resolutions; Buildings","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD054906)","","Singh A., Digital change detection techniques using remotely-sensed data, Int.

In a variety of studies census tracts or ZIP codes have been used as proxies for neighborhoods because the boundaries are pre-defined units for which other data are readily available. However these spatial units can be arbitrary and do not account for social-cultural behaviors and identities that are significant to residents. In this study for the city of Accra, Ghana, our goal was to create a neighborhood map that represented the boundaries generally agreed upon by the residents of the city using the smallest available census unit, the enumeration area (EA), as the base unit. This neighborhood map was then used as the basis for mapping spatial variations in health within the city. The first step in demarcating the boundaries was to identify features that limit a person's movement including the major roads, drainage features, and railroad tracks that people use to partially define their neighborhood boundaries. Once an initial set of boundaries were established, they were iteratively modified by walking the neighborhoods, talking to residents, public officials, and others. The resulting neighborhood map consolidated 1723 EAs into 108 neighborhoods covering the entire Accra metropolitan area. Results indicated that the team achieved 71% accuracy in mapping neighborhoods when the neighborhood keyed to the survey EA was compared with the response given by the interviewees in the 2008-2009 Women's Health Survey of Accra when asked which neighborhood they lived in. © 2013 Ryan Engstrom.","Developing country; Health; Neighborhood","","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This research was supported by Grant Number R01HD054906 from the Ethel Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

This study assesses the correlation between satellite-derived land cover and census-derived socioeconomic variables in Accra, Ghana to determine whether the relationship between these variables is altered with a change in spatial resolution or scale. ASTER and Landsat TM satellite images are each used to classify land cover using spectral mixture analysis (SMA), and land cover proportions are summarized across Enumeration Areas in Accra and compared to socioeconomic data for the same areas. Correlation and regression analyses compare the SMA results with a Slum Index created from various socioeconomic data taken from the Census of Ghana, as well as to data derived from a ""hard"" per-pixel classification of a 2.4 m Quickbird image. Results show that the vegetation fraction is significantly correlated with the Slum Index (Pearson's r ranges from-0.33 to-0.51, depending on which image-derived product is compared), and the use of a spatial error model improves results (multivariate model pseudo-R 2 ranges from 0.37 to 0.40 by image product). We also find that SMA products derived from ASTER are a sufficient substitute for classification products derived from higher spatial resolution QB data when using land cover fractions as a proxy for slum presence, suggesting that SMA might be more cost-effective for deriving land cover fractions than the use of high-resolution imagery for this type of demographic analysis.","","Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra; ASTER; developing world; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; neighborhood; QuickBird; satellite imagery; spatial resolution","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This research was funded by grant number R01 HD054906 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“Health, Poverty and Place in Accra, Ghana,” John R.

Fine spatial resolution (FRes) commercial satellite image in conjunction with geographic object-based image change analysis (GEOBICA) methods have been used to generate detailed and accurate urban LCLU maps. The integration of a backdating approach improves LCLU change classification results for the first date of a bi-temporal image sequences. Conversely, moderate spatial resolution satellite images such as those from Landsat sensors may not allow for detailed urban land use and land cover mapping. The objective of this study is to test a new bi-temporal change identification approach that integrates image classification of fine spatial resolution satellite imagery at time-2 and moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery (Landsat) at time-1, in a backdating and GEOBICA framework for mapping urban land use change. We compare the results from this approach to those of a GEOBICA approach based on fine spatial resolution imagery in both periods. The overall accuracy of the time-1 Landsat image classification is 0.82 and that of the fine spatial resolution image is 0.87. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the areal change data estimated from the pixel-wise spatial overlay of bi-temporal FRes LCLU maps is 0.80 while that from overlaying a time-2 FRes-generated map to that from a Landsat time-1 image is 0.81. The proposed method can be used in areas that lack FRes data due to limited coverage in the early 2000s. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Backdating; Change detection; Fine spatial resolution; GEOBICA; Land cover; Land use; Landsat; Urban","Change detection; Image analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Land use; Mapping; Remote sensing; Backdating; Change analysis; Change detection; Fine spatial resolution; Geographic object-based image change analyse; Geographic objects; Land cover; LANDSAT; Object based; Objects-based; Spatial resolution; Urban; accuracy assessment; detection method; image analysis; image classification; land cover; land use change; Landsat; map; model; pixel; remote sensing; satellite sensor; spatial resolution; urban area; Landsat","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (G00009708)","This research was supported by the Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science (IDS) program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NASA award number G00009708 .

SMA offers a way of analyzing satellite imagery of urban areas that may be superior to more standard methods of classification. Mixing models are based on the assumption that the remotely measured spectrum of a given pixel can be modeled as a combination of pure spectra, called endmembers. SMA, using four image endmembers (vegetation, impervious surface, soil, and shade), was applied to an IRS-1C multispectral image in order to extract measures that describe the anatomy of the Greater Cairo region, Egypt, in terms of endmember fractions. The resulting fractions were then used to classify the urban scene into eight classes of natural and human-built features through a decision tree (DT) classifier. The accuracy of the DT classification was compared to the accuracies of two per-pixel supervised classifications of the IRS-1C image employing maximum likelihood (ML) and minimum distance-to-means (MDM) classifiers. Overall KAPPA accuracies were 0.88 for the DT classification based on SMA fractions, and 0.60 and 0.45 for the classifications conducted through ML and MDM respectively.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (BCS-0095641); Andrew W.

METHODS Decennial census data of Ghana are used to estimate rates of 5q0 in 2000 and in 2010 and to note changes between 2000 and 2010 for the neighborhoods of Accra. Remote sensing data and methods are then used to derive urban land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC) information for the same neighborhoods and during the same time period. Population and housing demographic characteristics are derived and summarized at the neighborhood level to serve as potential covariates of the measures of urban change. Regression analyses are utilized to evaluate the relationships between child mortality and neighborhood environmental factors. RESULTS Results indicate spatial variability in rates of 5q0 in Accra for the year 2000. Such variations are minimal in 2010 due to the dramatic decline in child mortality between 2000 and 2010. Under-five child mortality was 20% in 2000 and 12% in 2010. Nontraditional toilet types and water supply sources are associated with high rates of 5q0.CONCLUSIONS Less reliance on public and informal toilets as well as improving housing drinking water quality have the potential to reduce under-five child mortality in Ghana. CONTRIBUTION By analyzing an extensive list of exploratory variables derived by combining remote sensing and demographic data, this paper increases our understanding of the factors associated with under-five child mortality. © 2020, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research.","","","","","","","","","Achebe C., Things Fall Apart, (1958);

Knowledge of spatial patterns is essential to understanding the processes that link individual demographic outcomes to characteristics of a place. A significant limitation, however, is the lack of spatial data and methods that offer flexibility in data inputs. OBJECTIVE This paper tackles some of the issues in calculating intra-urban child mortality by combining multiple data sets in Accra, Ghana and applying a new method developed by Rajaratnam et al. (2010) that efficiently uses summary birth histories for creating local-level measures of under-five child mortality (5q0). Intra-urban 5q0 rates are then compared with characteristics of the environment that may be linked to child mortality. METHODS Rates of child mortality are calculated for 16 urban zones within Accra for birth cohorts from 1987 to 2006. Estimates are compared to calculated 5q0 rates from full birth histories. 5q0 estimates are then related to zone measures of slum characteristics, housing quality, health facilities, and vegetation using a simple trendline R2 analysis. RESULTS Results suggest the potential value of the Rajaratnam et al. method at the micro-spatial scale. Estimated rates indicate that there is variability in child mortality between zones, with a spread of up to 50 deaths per 1,000 births. Furthermore, there is evidence that child mortality is connected to environmental factors such as housing quality, slum-like conditions, and neighborhood levels of vegetation. © 2013 Jankowska, Benza & Weeks.","","","","","","","","","Population and health dynamics in Nairobi's informal settlements: Report of the Nairobi cross-sectional slums survey (NCSS) 2000, (2002); Antai D., Moradi T., Urban area disadvantage and under-5 mortality in Nigeria: The effect of rapid urbanization, Environmental Health Perspectives, 118, 6, pp. 877-883, (2010); Balk D., Pullum T., Storeygard A., Greenwell F., Neuman M., A spatial analysis of childhood mortality in West Africa, Population, Space and Place, 10, 3, pp. 175-216, (2004); Boadi K.O., Kuitunen M., Factors affecting the choice of cooking fuel, cooking place and respiratory health in the Accra metropolitan area, Ghana, Journal of Biosocial Science, 38, 3, pp. 403-412, (2006); Boutayeb A., The double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases in developing countries, Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 100, 3, pp. 191-199, (2006); Cameron L., Williams J., Is the relationship between socioeconomic status and health stronger for older children in developing countries?, Demography, 46, 2, pp. 303-324, (2009); Cleveland W.S., Loader C., Smoothing by local regression: Principles and methods., (1996); Dunn J.R., Cummins S., Placing health in context, Social Science & Medicine, 65, 9, pp. 1821-1824, (2007); Elbers C., Lanjouw P., Mistiaen J., Ozler B., Simler K., Are neighbours equal?

This paper explores the hypothesis that premaritally (i.e. illegitimately) conceived legitimate births will be associated with higher levels of infant death rates than postmaritally conceived legitimate births. Data on births and deaths of children born to women in the marriage cohort of 1966 in California are examined and the hypothesis is substantiated. Differences in deaths due to immaturity are found to account for almost two-thirds of the differences in infant death rates by conception status. © 1976.","","Adolescent; Adult; California; Female; Human; Illegitimacy; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; age; fatality; immaturity; infant mortality; pregnancy","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Acknowledgements-This research was supported by a contract with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Responses were obtained from 80% of the superintendents, 45% of the principals and 39% of the FLE teachers who were sent questionnaires. While most superintendents reported the existence of an FLE program in at least one district school, the surveys revealed that less than one‐fourth of ninth graders and less than one‐third of 10th graders received such instruction during the 1981–1982 academic year. District decisions to offer FLE were reported to be most strongly influenced by school faculty and administrators while the decision not to offer FLE was most strongly influenced by clergy and special interest groups. More than half of the FLE teachers who returned surveys taught FLE as a unit within another course. Teachers generally covered a variety of curriculum topics, with units/courses most likely to address human development, physiology and sexual disease and least likely to deal with value‐laden topics such as premarital intercourse, sexual behavior and sexual preference. However, the greater number of class hours devoted to FLE, the greater the chance that these issues were covered in the curriculum. Finally, the data reveal that evaluation of FLE courses was relatively limited in scope and was largely subjective in many schools. 1984 American School Health Association","","Adolescent; Adult; California; Family; Female; Health Education; Humans; Male; Public Opinion; Questionnaires; Schools; adolescent; adult; article; family; female; health education; human; male; public opinion; questionnaire; school; standard; United States","","","","","","","Somerville R., Introduction to family life and sex education., (1972); Carrera M., Training the sex educator: Guidelines for teacher training institutions, Am J Public Health, 2, pp. 233-243, (1972); Hottois J., Milner N., The sex education controversy., (1975); Kirby D., Alter J., Scales P., An analysis of U.S. sex education programs and evaluation methods., (1979); Yarber W., McCabe G., Teacher characteristics and the inclusion of sex education topics in grades 6–8 and 9–11, J Sch Health, 51, 4, pp. 288-291, (1981); Orr MT, Sex education and contraceptive education in U.S. public high schools, Fam Plann Perspect, 14, 6, pp. 304-313, (1982); Gallup G., Teens Claim Sex Education Classes Helpful.

We apply the G∗i statistic to dasymetrically mapped data from the 1976, 1986 and 1996 censuses of Egypt to show that there were very distinct spatial patterns in fertility over time in this predominantly rural region of the Nile Delta. The spatial filtering technique allows us to conclude as well that the spatial component became more important over time as a predictor of fertility levels. Improvements in education represent a key feature of the changing rural social environment driving these spatial changes in fertility. There is evidence as well that increases in contraceptive utilization contributed to this change, but we are unable to evaluate its spatial component. Nonetheless, the research illustrates and illuminates the underlying conceptual framework that demographic behavior is a joint function of who people are and where they are. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","","","","","","","","","Anselin L., Rey S.J., Properties of tests for spatial dependence in linear regression models, Geogr Anal, 23, pp. 112-131, (1991); Arriaga E.E., Population Analysis with Microcomputers, (1994); El-Zanaty F.H., Way A.A., Egypt Demographic and Health Survey, (2001); Entwisle B., Casterline J.B., Sayed H., Villages as contexts for contraceptive behavior in rural Egypt, Am Sociol Rev, 54, pp. 1019-1034, (1989); Fargues P., State policies and the birth rate in Egypt: From socialism to liberalism, Popul Dev Rev, 23, pp. 115-138, (1997); Gadalla M.S., Is There Hope?

Consumption of drinking water packaged in plastic sachets has soared in West Africa over the last decade, but the long-term implications of these changing consumption patterns remain unclear and unstudied. This paper reviews recent shifts in drinking water, drawing upon data from the 2003 and 2008 Demographic and Health Surveys, and provides an overview of the history, economics, quality, and regulation of sachet water in Ghana's Accra-Tema Metropolitan Area. Given the pros and cons of sachet water, we suggest that a more holistic understanding of the drinking water landscape is necessary for municipal planning and sustainable drinking water provision. © IWA Publishing 2012.","Africa;
