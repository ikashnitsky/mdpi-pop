We use data from the American Time Use Survey to examine mothers’ and fathers’ momentary affect during childcare activities. We observe a gender imbalance in the emotional rewards of childcare: Fathers report more happiness, less stress, and less tiredness than mothers. We introduce the “care context”—defined as the type of childcare activity, when and where it takes place, who is present, and how much care is involved—as an explanation for these gender differences in parents’ affect. The analysis reveals that most dimensions of the care context vary between mothers and fathers. We also find that the care context fully accounts for differences in mothers’ and fathers’ happiness, partially explains differences in stress, and does little to explain differences in tiredness. Thus, the gender imbalance in the emotional rewards of childcare is partially due to parents’ highly gendered engagement with their children. © The Author(s) 2019.","childcare; father–child relationship; gender and family; household labor; mother–child relationship","","","","","","Population Research Institute; Brown University; Pennsylvania State University, PSU; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2C-HD041020, P2C-HD041025, T-32HD007514)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We acknowledge assistance provided by the Population Research Institute and the Predoctoral Family Demography Traineeship both at The Pennsylvania State University and the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University, all of which are supported by grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (P2C-HD041025, T-32HD007514, and P2C-HD041020 respectively).","Abraham K.G., Maitland A., Bianchi S.M., Nonresponse in the American Time Use Survey: Who is missing from the data and how much does it matter?, Public Opinion Quarterly, 70, pp. 676-703, (2006); Allard M.D., Bianchi S., Stewart J., Wright V.R., Comparing childcare measures in the ATUS and earlier time-diary studies, Monthly Labor Review, 130, pp. 27-36, (2007); Amato P.R., Children’s adjustment to divorce: Theories, hypotheses, and empirical support, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 55, pp. 23-38, (1993); Berk S., The Gender Factory: The Apportionment of Work in American Households, (1985); Bianchi S.M., Maternal employment and time with children: Dramatic change or surprising continuity?, Demography, 37, pp. 401-414, (2000); Bianchi S.M., Family change and time allocation in American families, ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 638, pp. 21-44, (2011); Bittman M., England P., Sayer L., Folbre N., Matheson G., When does gender trump money?

We evaluated the pre-diagnostic cost and health seeking behaviour of new adult pulmonary TB patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. Methods This descriptive study, part of a randomised controlled trial conducted in three rural Tuberculosis Units from Dec 2012 to Dec 2015, collected data on number of health facilities, dates of visits prior to the initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment, and direct OOP medical costs associated with TB diagnosis. Logistic regression analysis examined the factors associated with delays in treatment initiation and OOP expenditures. Results Of 880 TB patients interviewed, 34.7% presented to public health facilities and 65% patients sought private health facilities as their first point of care. The average monthly individual income was $77.79 (SD 57.14). About 69% incurred some pre-treatment costs at an average of $39.74. Overall, patients experienced a median of 6 days (3-11 IQR) of time to treatment initiation and 21 days (10-30 IQR) of health systems delay. Age 40 years (aOR: 1.73; CI: 1.22-2.44), diabetes (aOR: 1.63; CI: 1.08-2.44) and first visit to a private health facility (aOR: 17.2; CI: 11.1-26.4) were associated with higher direct OOP medical costs, while age 40 years (aOR: 0.64; CI: 0.48-0.85) and first visit to private health facility (aOR: 1.79, CI: 1.34-2.39) were associated with health systems delay. Conclusion The majority of rural TB patients registering at PHCs visited private health facilities first and incurred substantial direct OOP medical costs and delays prior to diagnosis and anti-tuberculosis treatment initiation. This study highlights the need for PHCs to be made as the preferred choice for first point of contact, to combat TB more efficiently.

In this study, we use life history calendar data to investigate the relationship between changes in residence and timing of premarital sexual debut among young people in urban Kenya. By age 18, 64 percent of respondents had initiated premarital sex, and 45 percent had moved at least once between the ages of 12 and 18. Results of the event history analysis show that girls and boys who move during early adolescence experience the earliest onset of sexual activity. For adolescent girls, however, other dimensions of migration provide protective effects, with greater numbers of residential changes and residential changes in the last one to three months associated with later sexual initiation. To support young people's ability to navigate the social, economic, and sexual environments that accompany residential change, researchers and policymakers should consider how various dimensions of migration affect sexual activity. © 2012 The Population Council, Inc.","","Adolescent; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Kenya; Male; Proportional Hazards Models; Sexual Behavior; Urban Population; Young Adult; Kenya; gender disparity; life history; policy making; population migration; sexual behavior; urban population; adolescent; adult; article; female; human; interview; Kenya; male; migration; proportional hazards model; sexual behavior; urban population","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD041020)","","Adegbola O., Babatola O., Premarital and extramarital sex in Lagos, Nigeria,, The Continuing HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Africa: Responses and Coping Strategies, pp. 19-44, (1999); Akresh I.R., Dietary assimilation and health among Hispanic immigrants to the United States,, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 48, 4, pp. 404-417, (2007); Axinn W.G., Pearce L.D., Ghimire D., Innovations in life history calendar applications,, Social Science Research, 28, 3, pp. 243-264, (1999); Balan J., Browning H.L., Jelin E., Litzler L., A computerized approach to the processing and analysis of life histories obtained in sample surveys,, Behavioral Science, 14, 2, pp. 105-120, (1969); Baumer E.P., South S.J., Community effects on youth sexual activity,, Journal of Marriage and Family, 63, 2, pp. 540-554, (2001); Beegle K., De Weerdt J., Dercon S., Orphanhood and human capital destruction: Is there persistence into adulthood?, Demography, 47, 1, pp. 163-180, (2010); Belli R.F., The structure of autobiographical memory and the event history calendar: Potential improvements in the quality of retrospective reports in surveys,, Memory, 6, 4, pp. 383-406, (1998); Belli R.F., Callegaro M., The emergence of calendar interviewing: A theoretical and empirical rationale,, Calendar and Time Diary Methods in Life Course Research, pp. 31-52, (2009); Birdthistle I., Floyd S., Nyagadza A., Mudziwapasi N., Gregson S., Glynn J.R., Is education the link between orphanhood and HIV/HSV-2 risk among female adolescents in urban Zimbabwe?, Social Science & Medicine, 68, 10, pp. 1810-1818, (2009); Brockerhoff M., Biddlecom A.E., Migration, sexual behavior and the risk of HIV in Kenya,, International Migration Review, 33, 4, pp. 833-856, (1999); Browning C.R., Leventhal T., Brooks-Gunn J., Sexual initiation in early adolescence: The nexus of parental and community control,, American Sociological Review, 70, 5, pp. 758-778, (2005); Case A., Ardington C., The impact of parental death on school outcomes: Longitudinal evidence from South Africa,, Demography, 43, 3, pp. 401-420, (2006); Cohen J.H., The Culture of Migration in Southern Mexico, (2004); Dixon-Mueller R., How young is 'too young'?

This study applied social exchange theory to premarital relationships in order to investigate the linkages between a variety of young women's resources-including employment and material transfers from male partners-and sexual behaviors. Data on the first month of premarital relationships (N = 551 relationships) were collected from a random sample of young adult women ages 18-24 in Kisumu, Kenya, using a retrospective life history calendar. Consistent with the hypotheses, results showed that young women's income increases the likelihood of safer sexual activities, including delaying sex and using condoms consistently. Material transfers from the male partner displayed the opposite effect, supporting the view that resources obtained within the relationship decrease young women's negotiating power. © National Council on Family Relations, 2011.","Adolescent sexual behavior; AIDS; Decision making; Social exchange; Transactional sex","","","","","","","","Agarwal B., Bargaining"" and gender relations: Within and beyond the household., Feminist Economics, 3, pp. 1-51, (1997); Axinn W.G., Pearce L.D., Ghimire D., Innovations in life history calendar applications., Social Science Research, 28, pp. 243-264, (1999); Baumeister R.F., Vohs K.D., Sexual economics: Sex as female resource for social exchange in heterosexual interactions., Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8, pp. 339-363, (2004); Belli R.F., Callegaro M., The emergence of calendar interviewing., Calendar and time diary methods in life course research, pp. 31-52, (2009); Biddlecom A., Gregory R., Lloyd C.B., Mensch B.S., Associations between premarital sex and leaving school in four sub-Saharan African countries., Studies in Family Planning, 39, pp. 337-350, (2008); Bittman M., England P., Folbre N., Sayer L., Matheson G., When does gender trump money?

Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted in 1997 with stakeholders in eight countries -three in Asia (Bangladesh, India and Nepal), three in the Middle East and Africa (Jordan, Ghana and Senegal) and two in Latin America and the Caribbean (Jamaica and Peru). Results: While all but two of the countries have adopted the ICPD definition of reproductive health and all have initiated policy reforms to reflect a new focus, less has been accomplished in implementing integrated reproductive health programs. Several challenges face all eight countries as they continue to design reproductive health programs: improving knowledge and support among stakeholders; planning for integration and decentralized services; developing human resources; improving quality of care; and maintaining a long-term perspective regarding the implementation of the Cairo agenda. Conclusions: The next critical steps needed for moving from policy formulation to program implementation are to help countries set priorities for establishing integrated reproductive health interventions, to increase financing for services and to develop strategies for delivering them.","","","","","","","","","Mitra S.N., Et al., Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 1996-1997, (1997); Revised 1990 Estimates of Maternal Mortality: A New Approach by WHO and UNICEF, (1996); Health and Population Sector Strategy, (1997); 1997 World Population Data Sheet, (1997); Measham A.R., Heaver R.A., Supplement to India's Family Welfare Programme: Moving to a Reproductive and Child Health Approach, (1996); Pradhan A., Et al., Nepal Family Health Survey, 1996, (1997); Nepal Family Health Survey, 1996, (1997); Reproductive Health Strategy, (1996); Annual Report, 1996/97, (1997); Jordan Population and Family Health Survey, 1997, Preliminary Report, (1998); Nsheiwat M.I., Al-Khalidi Z., Maternal mortality study, Jordan's Health Status: Findings from the Epidemiological Studies and Strategies for Future Surveillance System, (1997); National Population Strategy in Jordan; World Development Report 1997, (1997); Women of the World: Laws and Policies Affecting Their Reproductive Lives, (1997); National Reproductive Health Service Policy and Standards, (1996); Ndiaye S., Ayad M., Gaye A., Enquête Démographique et de Santé au Sénégal (EDS-III), 1997, (1997); Ndiaye S., Diouf P.D., Ayad M., Enquête Démographique et de Santé au Sénégal (EDS-II), 1992/93, (1994); Programme National en Santé de la Reproduction, 1997-2001, (1997); Programme National en Santé de la Reproduction, 1997-2001, (1997); McFarlane C.P., Et al., Reproductive Health Survey, Jamaica, 1997, Preliminary Report, (1996); National Plan of Action on Population and Development (1995-2015), (1995); Becker J., Leitman E., Introducing sexuality within family planning: The experience of three HIV/STD prevention projects from Latin America and the Caribbean, Quality/Calidad/Qualité, 8, (1997); Encuesta Demográfica y de Salud Familiar, 1996, (1997); Programma de Salud Reproductiva y Planificacion Familiar (1996-2000), (1996); Hardee K., Yount K.M., From Rhetoric to Reality: Delivering Reproductive Health Promises Through Integrated Services, (1995); Integration of Health Care Delivery, Report of a WHO Study Group, (1996)","","","Alan Guttmacher Institute","","","","","","01622749","","","","English","Int.

Kin and affine networks, organized around the marriage institution, are shown to improve the individual's labor market outcomes, while at the same time increasing his social obligations, in Kisumu. Caste-based networks, also kept in place by the marriage institution, are shown to shape career choices in Bombay. Although the marriage institution may have demonstrated a significant degree of flexibility in transplanting traditional (rural) networks to the city, we argue that these networks will ultimately break down in the face of economic globalization. © 2004 by the European Economic Association.","","","","","","","","","Chandavarkar R., The Origins of Industrial Capitalism in India: Business Strategies and The Working Classes in Bombay, 1900-1940, (1994); Gore M.S., Immigrants and Neighborhoods: Two Aspects of Life in a Metropolitan City, (1970); Levi-Strauss C., The Elementary Structures of Kinship, (1969); Luke N., Munshi K., Does Marriage Influence Individual Behavior in Urban Africa?

Using unique micro-level data from Iraq, we create measures of cumulative exposure to violence since conception for children ages two to five based on their date of birth and geographic location. We examine the relationship between height-for-age z-scores, a measure of chronic malnutrition, and four indicators of violence in a regression framework, adjusting for potential confounders and trends. We find that a child exposed to the maximum number of violent incidents is likely to experience a 0.5 standard deviation reduction in height-for-age z-score compared to a child who is exposed to no incidents. Each type of attack we evaluate is negatively associated with height-for-age. Further analysis reveals that the associations are the strongest for children in the northern and central regions where the bulk of the violent incidents occurred. Contrary to our expectation, the associations are similar for boys and girls. Our findings suggest that, in addition to efforts aimed at decreasing violent conflict in Iraq in general, the government and its development partners should focus relief, recovery, and reconstruction efforts in the central and northern regions of the country. © 2020 The Authors","Children; Conflict; Iraq; Nutrition; Violence","age; Article; assessment of humans; catering service; child; child nutrition; chronic disease; conflict; controlled study; date of birth; female; geographic distribution; height for age z score; human; incidence; Iraq; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; nutritional status; parameters concerning the fetus, newborn and pregnancy; priority journal; sanitation; sex difference; social status; trend study; violence; water supply","","","","","","","Akombi B.J., Agho K.E., Hall J.J., Wali N., Renzaho A.M.N., Merom D., Stunting, wasting and underweight in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14, 8, pp. 1-18, (2017); Akresh B.R., Bhalotra S., Leone M., Osili U.O., War and Stature : Growing up during the Nigerian civil war, The American Economic Review, 102, 3, pp. 273-277, (2012); Akresh R., Lucchetti L., Thirumurthy H., Wars and child health : Evidence from the Eritrean – Ethiopian conflict, Journal of Development Economics, 99, 2, pp. 330-340, (2012); Allotey P., Reidpath D.D., The health of refugees: Public health perspectives from crisis to settlement, (2019); Berman E., Condra L.N., Felter J.H., Shapiro J.N., ESOC – Iraq civil war dataset codebook for version 3.0, (2012); Berman E., Shapiro J.N., Felter J.H., Can hearts and minds Be Bought ?

In Uttar Pradesh (UP), India, local status hierarchies of gender, caste, and generation shape the nature of relationships that community-based distributors (CBDs) create with their clients. In this case study of an ""ideal"" distributor, we uncover the conflicting expectations that many CBDs experience: to comply with project objectives without violating local social norms that limit interactions across status boundaries. Our CBD responded to these dual pressures with varying strategies, often perpetuating social distance and restricting information and services for men, adolescents, and other marginalized populations. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Adolescent; Adult; Community Health Aides; Community Health Services; Family Planning Services; Female; Hierarchy, Social; Humans; India; Male; Rural Population; Social Environment; Socioeconomic Factors; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; article; community care; family planning; female; health auxiliary; human; India; male; methodology; organization and management; psychological aspect; rural population; social dominance; social environment; socioeconomics; standard; task performance","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R24HD041020)","","Aggarwal O., Sharma A.K., Chhabra P., Study in sexuality of medical college students in India, Journal of Adolescent Health, 26, pp. 226-229, (2000); Arends-Kuenning M., How do family planning workers' visits affect women's contraceptive behavior in Bangladesh?, Demography, 38, pp. 481-496, (2001); Bertrand J., McBride M.E., Mangani N., Baughman N.C., Kinuani M., Community based distribution of contraceptives in Zaire, International Family Planning Perspectives, 19, 3, pp. 84-91, (1993); Bertrand J.T., Pineda M.A., Santiso R., Hearn S., Characteristics of successful distributors in the community-based distribution of contraceptives in Guatemala, Studies In Family Planning, 11, 9-10, pp. 274-285, (1980); Betancourt R., Gleason S., The allocation of publicly-provided goods to rural households in India: On some consequences of caste, religion, and democracy, World Development, 28, pp. 2169-2182, (2000); Bloom S.S., Tsui A.O., Plotkin M., Bassett S., What husbands in Northern India know about reproductive health: Correlates of knowledge about pregnancy and maternal and sexual health, Journal of Biosocial Science, 32, pp. 237-251, (2000); Chege J., Sanogo D., Askew I., An Assessment of the Community Based Distribution Programs In Ghana, (2000); Cornish F., Ghosh R., The necessary contradictions of 'community-led' health promotion: A case study of HIV prevention in an Indian red light district, Social Science & Medicine, 64, pp. 496-507, (2007); Das Gupta M., Life course perspectives on women's autonomy and health outcomes, American Anthropologist, 97, pp. 481-491, (1995); Deshpande A., Assets versus autonomy?

Using new data from Kisumu, Kenya, and controlling for selection into marriage, we find that marriage significantly increases employment levels and incomes in our sample of migrants. At the same time, marriage increases the remittances that migrants send to the extended family, consistent with the view that the benefits of the network come with additional social obligations. These obligations appear to be borne disproportionately by high-ability individuals, who consequently defer marriage. The negative selection into marriage that we uncover has consequences for the future viability of the urban networks, with implications for long-term growth and distribution in this economy. © 2006 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Johnson S., Robinson J., The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation, American Economic Review, 91, pp. 1369-1401, (2001); Adepoju A., Mbugua W., The African family: An overview of changing forms, Family, Population and Development in Africa, (1997); Angrist J.D., Estimation of limited dependent variable models with dummy endogenous regressors: Simple strategies for empirical practice, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 19, 1, pp. 2-16, (2001); Ayot H.O., A History of the Luo-abasuba of Western Kenya, (1979); Bloch F., Ryder H., Two-sided search, marriages, and matchmakers, International Economic Review, 41, 1, pp. 93-115, (2000); Botticini M., Siow A., Why dowries?, American Economic Review, 93, 4, pp. 1385-1398, (2003); Brockerhoff M.P., An Urbanizing World.

Information is needed about sugar daddy partnerships - and about age and economic asymmetries more generally - to determine how common they are and whether they are related to unsafe sexual behavior. METHODS: The sample compris ed 1,052 men aged 21-45 who were surveyed in Kisumu, Kenya, in 2001. Data on these men and their 1,614 recent nonmarital partnerships were analyzed to calculate the prevalence of sugar daddies and sugar daddy relationships, as well as a range of age and economic disparities within nonmarital partnerships. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess relationships between condom use at last sexual intercourse and various measures of age and economic asymmetry. RESULTS: The mean age difference between nonmarital sexual partners was 5.5 years, and 47% of men's female partners were adolescents. Fourteen percent of partnerships involved an age difference of at least 10 years, and 23% involved more than the mean amount of male-to-female material assistance. Men who reported at least one partnership with both these characteristics were defined as sugar daddies and made up 5% of the sample; sugar daddy relationships accounted for 4% of partnerships. Sugar daddy partnerships and the largest age and economic asymmetries we constructed were associated with decreased odds of condom use. CONCLUSIONS: Although sugar daddy relationships are not as pervasive as generally assumed, age and economic asymmetries in nonmarital partnerships are relatively common. All these types of asymmetries are associated with nonuse of condoms.

One challenge is measuring the occurrence of foetal loss, which is difficult to recognize and report in survey research. This study uses the length of the birth interval as a proxy for foetal loss; foetal loss restarts the clock on time to conception and lengthens the birth interval. We use Demographic and Health Survey data on second births to women in 17 sub-Saharan African countries. Results show that longer second birth intervals are significantly related to lower odds of a male second birth and to feminine sex ratios at birth. These findings suggest that high levels of foetal loss, which could signal underlying poor maternal health in a population, have dramatic effects on the sex ratio at birth. © 2021 Population Investigation Committee.","birth interval; foetal loss; maternal stress; miscarriage; sex ratio; spontaneous abortion; sub-Saharan Africa","Africa South of the Sahara; Birth Intervals; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Parturition; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Sex Ratio; Sub-Saharan Africa; abortion; birth interval; demographic survey; maternal health; research; sex ratio; Africa south of the Sahara; birth; epidemiology; family planning; female; human; male; newborn; pregnancy; prenatal care; sex ratio","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2CHD041025); Pennsylvania State University, PSU, (P2C HD041025); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","The authors would like to thank Jennifer Van Hook, as well as the editor and anonymous reviewers, for helpful comments.

Methods: Using longitudinal survey data from the Tsogolo la Thanzi project (2009–2012) in Malawi, this study employed logistic regression analysis to investigate the influence of young women’s emotions, expectations, and a standard measure of fertility preferences on pregnancy and modern contraceptive use. Results: Young women experienced high unmet need; across survey waves, over three-quarters of women who desired a child in more than 2 years were not currently using modern contraceptives and over three-quarters of women who thought a pregnancy in the next month would be bad news (garnered from a measure of emotions surrounding pregnancy) were not currently using modern contraceptives. In regression models including all three measures of fertility preferences, each was significantly associated with the likelihood of a future pregnancy. The standard measure and emotions measure were significantly associated with modern contraceptive use. Discussion: Emotions and expectations surrounding pregnancy and childbirth appear to be distinct and salient aspects of fertility preferences in addition to the standard measure. A better understanding of the multidimensional nature of fertility preferences will help individuals define and achieve their reproductive goals and obtain appropriate services. Furthermore, future research should incorporate new measures of fertility preferences into surveys internationally. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Contraceptives; Fertility intentions; Fertility preferences; Malawi; Pregnancy","Adolescent; Family Planning Services; Female; Fertility; Fertility Clinics; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Malawi; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult; adolescent; family planning; female; fertility; human; longitudinal study; Malawi; organization and management; procedures; socioeconomics; young adult","","","","","Jenny Trinitapoli and Sara Yeatman, (R01-HD058366, R01-HD077873); Pennsylvania State University for Population Research Infrastructure, (P2C HD041025, T32 HD007514); Population Research Institute; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (T32HD007514)","This study uses data from Tsogolo la Thanzi, a research project designed by Jenny Trinitapoli and Sara Yeatman, and funded by Grants R01-HD058366 and R01-HD077873 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).

Early-life malnutrition has been shown to affect long-term health and income. One hypothesized channel linking early-life malnutrition and long-term outcomes is cognitive development. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the relationship between nutritional status and cognitive achievement in middle childhood. Study design As part of the South India Community Health Study (SICHS), we collected educational attainment and anthropometric data from 1,194 children in rural Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, India, and assessed their math and reading skills. We analyzed the relationship between continuous and binary anthropometric measures of nutritional status and three measures of cognitive achievement (reading, math, and grade level), adjusting for potential confounders, using a regression framework. Results Lower height-for-age and weight-for-age and their corresponding binary measures (stunting, underweight) were associated with lower reading scores, lower math scores, and lower grade level, with the exception of the association between weight-for-age and reading, which was marginally significant. A stunted child had one-third of a grade disadvantage compared to a non-stunted counterpart, whereas an underweight child had one-fourth of a grade disadvantage compared to a non-underweight counterpart. Lower BMI-for-age was associated with grade level and marginally associated with lower math scores, and its binary measure (thinness) was marginally associated with lower math scores. Conclusions Acute and chronic malnutrition in middle childhood were negatively associated with math scores, reading scores, and educational attainment. Our study provides new evidence that cognitive achievement during middle childhood could be an important mechanism underlying the association between early-life malnutrition and long-term wellbeing. © 2019 Acharya et al.

Using unique life-history calendar data from a population-based sample of youths aged 18-24 in urban Kenya, we estimated the prevalence and correlates of concurrency. In the sixth month before the survey, 3.5 per cent of females and 4.0 per cent of males were engaged in concurrent sexual partnerships. In the previous 9.5 years, males experienced more concurrent partnerships than females and they were of shorter duration. Using survival analysis, we find that the characteristics of initial partnerships affect entry into a second (concurrent) relationship. For females, geographic separation from a partner increases the risk of concurrency, while concurrency is positively associated with the duration of the initial relationship for males. For both sexes, the perception of partner infidelity increases the risk, suggesting that concurrency expands individuals' sexual networks and bridges additional networks involving partners' other sexual partners. © 2010 Population Investigation Committee.","Concurrency; Kenya; Sexual behaviour; Sexual networks; Survival analysis; Youth","Kenya; demographic survey; life history trait; perception; sexual behavior; social network; urban population; young population","","","","","Department of Sociology; Population Studies and Training Center; UTRA; University of Chi-cago; Brown University; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (21-HD 053587, R21HD053587, R24HD041020)","2 The data on which the analyses in this paper are based came from the Urban Life among Youth in Kisumu Project, directed by Nancy Luke, Brown University, Shelley Clark, McGill University, and Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu, Director, African Institute for Development Policy (AFIDEP), P.O Box 1 14688-00800, Westlands, Nairobi, Kenya.

A framework of competing commitment predicts that new relationships affect remittances depending on the extent to which they substitute for the benefits provided by origin families. Analyses of data from urban migrants in Kenya show that serious nonmarital sexual partners substitute for psychosocial support from the rural family and that material transfers migrants give to these partners significantly reduce remittances. The findings have implications for the ways scholars conceive of competition, the nature of exchange, and substitution of support across intimate relationships. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

Informal exchange relationships are widespread in many African contexts and are believed to contribute to rising levels of HIV infection, particularly among adolescent girls. In this article, I use the term ""informal exchange relationships"" to designate nonmarital sexual partnerships where material items are given by a male to his female partner. I use the umbrella term ""transfers"" to describe the items that are given, whether monetary or nonmonetary. The major aim of this article is to determine if a market for unsafe sexual activity among informal relationships exists in a high HIV/AIDS environment, with money and gifts traded for sex without a condom. The article is divided into five sections. The second section lays out a conceptual framework that characterizes the properties of a market for unsafe sexual behavior, which leads to the testable prediction that condom use and transfers should be negatively correlated within partnerships. This section also describes the alternative view, which predicts the absence of such a relationship. The third section describes the empirical specification, data, and variables. The fourth section presents the estimates of the correlation between transfers and condom use in three parts: (1) the overall relationship between the level of transfers and the probability of condom use, (2) the relationship with monetary and nonmonetary transfers separately, and (3) the relationship between transfers and condom use across partnerships with females of different ages (adolescents vs. adults). The last section concludes. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

Communities are often defined as residential spaces, such as neighborhoods, or as social groupings, such as caste in India. Using data from a group of tea estates in South India, we attempt to address important methodological challenges in the identification of neighborhood effects on child health. We find significant neighborhood effects for weight for age at age one, including a protective role for community-level women's education, but none for birth weight.

HIV counseling and testing is considered an important component of HIV prevention and treatment. This paper examines the characteristics of young males and females at the time of first reported HIV test, including the influence of recent sexual partnerships, and investigates how HIV testing and the cumulative number of tests are associated with sexual behaviors within six months of testing. Methods. The study uses data from a random sample of youth aged 18-24 years living in Kisumu, Kenya, who were interviewed using a 10-year retrospective life history calendar. Cox regression models were used to examine the correlates of the timing of first HIV test. Variance-correction models for unordered repeated events were employed to examine whether having an HIV test in the previous six months and the cumulative number of tests predict unsafe sexual practices in a given month. Results. Sixty-four percent of females and 55% of males reported at least one HIV test in the last 10 years and 40% of females were pregnant the month of first test. Significant correlates of first HIV test included marital aspirations among non-pregnant females, unprotected sex in the previous six months among pregnant females, and concurrency in the previous six months among males. Having a recent HIV test was associated with a decreased likelihood of unprotected sex among ever-pregnant females, an increased likelihood of unprotected sex and ""risky"" sexual partnerships among never-pregnant females, and an increased likelihood of concurrency among males. Repeated HIV testing was associated with a lower likelihood of concurrency among males and involvement in ""risky"" sexual partnerships among males and never-pregnant females. Conclusions. The high rate of pregnancy at first test suggests that promotion of HIV testing as part of prevention of mother-to-child transmission is gaining success. Further research is warranted to examine how and why behavior change is influenced by client- versus provider-initiated testing. The influence of different sexual partnership variables for males and females suggests that interventions to assess risk and promote testing should be gender- and relationship-specific. The findings also suggest that encouraging repeat or routine testing could potentially increase the uptake of safer sexual behaviors. © 2010 Kabiru et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Adolescent; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Kenya; Male; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pregnancy; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Sexual Behavior; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; article; disease transmission; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Kenya; male; patient attitude; pregnancy; proportional hazards model; psychological aspect; retrospective study; sexual behavior; vertical transmission","","","","","Population Studies and Training Center; UTRA; Rockefeller Foundation, (2008 AR 001); William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, HF, (2006-8376); Brown University; University of Chicago; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R21-HD 053587, R24HD041020); Department of Sociology, University of Alabama at Birmingham","Funding for this research was provided by a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R21-HD 053587).

The study revealed that the wealthier men display great risky behavior than poorer men by abandoning condom use, thereby giving large disease transfers to their female partners. The survey aimed to accumulate information on male nonmarital sexual behavior not restricted to commercial sex and this information proved to be useful to analyze the relationship between male wealth and sexual behavior. It offered information about multiple sexual partnerships between respondents with details of both respondents of the partnership. The Kisumu survey also concluded that the informal exchange of money and gifts has become an expected practice in many African countries such that no woman agrees to have sex unless receiving some sort of transfer.","","Africa; East Africa; Kenya; Kisumu; Nyanza; Sub-Saharan Africa; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; condom use; disease transmission; gender role; health risk; human immunodeficiency virus; risk assessment; sexual behavior; socioeconomic status; survey","","","","","","","Ahmed S., Lutalo T., Wawer M., Serwadda D., Sewankambo N.K., Nalugoda F., Makumbi F., Wabwire-Mangen F., Kiwanuka N., Kigozi G., Kiddugavu M., Gray R., HIV Incidence and Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevalence Associated with Condom Use: A Population.

Studies, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Watkins S.C., Population Studies Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States","The authors examine the global diffusion of international population policy, which they consider a cultural item. The process of cultural diffusion is often seen as spontaneous: items of Western cultural are in demand because they are universally attractive. Yet cultural flows may also be directed, they may be unattractive to their intended recipients, and their acceptance may depend on persuasion and material incentives. The authors consider the range of responses of national elites to the new population policy adopted by the United Nations at Cairo in 1994. Strongly influenced by feminists, the Cairo Program of Action promotes gender equity and reproductive health and demotes previous concerns with population growth. The data are interviews with representatives of governmental and nongovernmental organizations involved in population and health in five developing countries. To interpret the interviews, the authors draw on two theoretical frameworks. The first emphasizes the attractiveness of new cultural items and the creation of a normative consensus about their value. The second emphasizes differentials in power and resources among global actors and argues that the diffusion of cultural items can be directed by powerful donor states. Interviews in Bangladesh, Ghana, Jordan, Malawi, and Senegal portray a mixed reception to Cairo: enthusiastic embrace of certain aspects of the Cairo policy by some members of the national elite and a realistic assessment of donor power by virtually all. Strategies of rhetoric and action appear to be aimed at maintaining and directing the flows of donor funds.","","population growth; population policy; United Nations","","","","","","","Barrett D., Frank D.J., Population control for national development: From world discourse to national policies, Constructing World Culture: International Nongovernmental Organizations Since 1875, (1999); Barrett D., Ong Tsui A., Policy as symbolic statement: International response to national population policies, Social Forces, 78, 1, pp. 213-233, (1999); Berelson B., The great debate on population policy: An instructive entertainment, International Family Planning Perspectives, 16, 4, pp. 126-138, (1975); Berkovitch N., The emergence and transformation of the international women's movement, Constructing World Culture: International Nongovernmental Organizations Since 1875, (1999); Bledsoe C., Banja F., Hill A.G., Reproductive mishaps and Western contraception: An African challenge to fertility theory, Population and Development Review, 24, 1, pp. 15-57, (1998); Boli J., Thomas G.M., World culture in the world polity, American Sociological Review, 62, 2, pp. 171-190, (1997); Boli J., Introduction, Constructing World Culture: International Nongovernmental Organizations Since 1875, (1999); Boli J., INGOs and the organization of world culture, Constructing World Culture: International Nongovernmental Organizations Since 1875, (1999); Bongaarts J., Watkins S.C., Social interactions and contemporary fertility transitions, Population and Development Review, 22, 4, pp. 639-682, (1996); Bordo M.D., James H., The International Monetary Fund: Its Present Role in Historical Perspective, (2000); Brown M.B., Africa's Choices: After Thirty Years of the World Bank, (1995); Chabbott C., Development INGOs, Constructing World Culture: International Nongovernmental Organizations Since 1875, (1999); Chase-Dunn C., Kawano Y., Brewer B.D., Trade globalization since 1795: Waves of integration in the world system, American Sociological Review, 65, 1, pp. 77-95, (2000); Chilowa W., Sustainable social and human development in Malawi: Towards poverty alleviation?, Bwalo, SPEC.

Demographers have developed various private response methods to minimize social desirability bias and improve the quality of reporting; however, these methods often limit the complexity of information collected. We designed a life history calendar-the Relationship History Calendar (RHC)-to increase the scope of data collected on sexual relationships and behavior while enhancing their quality. The RHC records detailed, 10-year retrospective information on sexual relationship histories. The structure and interview procedure draw on qualitative techniques, which could reduce social desirability bias. We compare the quality of data collected with the RHC with a standard face-to-face survey instrument through a field experiment conducted among 1,275 youth in Kisumu, Kenya. The results suggest that the RHC reduces social desirability bias and improves reporting on multiple measures, including higher rates of abstinence among males and multiple recent sexual partnerships among females. The RHC fosters higher levels of rapport and respondent enjoyment, which appear to be the mechanisms through which social desirability bias is minimized. The RHC is an excellent alternative to private response methods and could potentially be adapted for large-scale surveys. © 2011 Population Association of America.","Condom use; Data collection; Life history calendar; Sexual behavior; Survey methodology","","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Population Studies and Training Center; University of Chicago; UTRA; Brown University; Department of Sociology, University of Alabama at Birmingham; African Population and Health Research Center, APHRC; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R21HD053587, R24HD041020)","Funding for this research was provided by a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (R21-HD 053587), as well as supplementary funding from the Population Studies and Training Center, Department of Sociology, and UTRA at Brown University; the African Population and Health Research Center; and the Population Research Center at the University of Chicago.

We use qualitative data to explore the relocation decision-making process of married and unmarried partners. We find that, while many partners have educational and career aspirations of their own, the maintenance of the relationship is a strong priority that dictates how and when a tied move occurs. Furthermore, the decision-making process is varied and depends on the stage of the relationship. Tied movers at earlier points in their relationships often make independent decisions to join their graduate student partners after the student has already initiated the move. Some of those in more mature relationships follow a traditional mover–follower model, while others participate in joint decision-making about their destination. Finally, we find that over one-third of the tied movers are male, reflecting both increases in women's migration for graduate school and men's openness to ‘following’ career-oriented partners. This paper contributes to the study of family migration by developing a model focusing on individual and collective non-economic determinants of couples' decisions to migrate for skill development.

Two separate areas of research have examined supports that could alleviate these constraints and potentially increase fertility: institutional support in the form of public policies and domestic labor support from male partners. There are few studies considering the influence of both policy and domestic labor supports and no investigations of the interplay between these two support mechanisms. We develop and test a theoretical framework that considers how the combination of these supports could alleviate women's work-family constraints and increase fertility. Using the case of South Korea, a country with one of the most sustained lowest-low fertility rates in history, we examined the relationship between women's eligibility for parental leave and husbands' share of domestic labor and the transition to a second birth. Our analyses revealed that both supports, independently, had positive effects on the likelihood of a second birth. More importantly, we found that husbands' domestic labor had a positive influence on fertility only when women's access to parental leave was limited, suggesting that policy and domestic labor supports are substitutes and alleviate the same underlying work-family constraint in the Korean context. Our study underscores the importance of understanding the nature of work-family conflict across countries and how various supports-alone or in combination-could relieve women's constraints on childbearing and upturn lowest-low fertility. © The Author(s) 2020.

We use life history data collected in Kisumu, Kenya, to investigate how the timing and number of rural-to-urban moves are associated with premarital pregnancy. Among sexually experienced young women aged 18 to 24 (N = 226), 60 percent had moved at least once in the past 10 years and 38 percent had experienced a premarital pregnancy. Results of the event history analysis show that those who experienced one or two moves were at increased risk for premarital pregnancy compared to nonmovers. Also at increased risk were movers whose most recent move occurred in the past 7 to 12 months. Finally, those whose last move occurred at age 13 or younger were also at an elevated risk. Migration brings about specific risks and needs for youths, including the need for sexual and reproductive health education and services, which should be made available and accessible to new urban residents. © American Academy of Political & Social Science 2013.","adolescents; Africa; migration; premarital pregnancy; sexual behavior","","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (21-HD 053587); African Population and Health Research Center, APHRC","The data used in this analysis come from the Urban Life among Youth in Kisumu Project, directed by Nancy Luke, Brown University; Shelley Clark, McGill University; and Eliya Zulu, African Institute for Development Policy.

This study explored how various dimensions of socioeconomic status are associated with inconsistent condom use and how these associations vary by gender. We analyzed unique life history survey data from 261 young men and women in Kisumu, Kenya, and conducted analyses based on 959 person-months in which respondents had been sexually active in nonmarital relationships. Dependent variables were inconsistent condom use (not always using a condom) and never use of condoms. Condoms were used inconsistently in 57% of months and were never used in 31%. Corroborating existing literature, lower household wealth and lower educational attainment were associated with inconsistent condom use. Lower individual economic status (lower earned income, food insufficiency, and larger material transfers from partners) were also important determinants of inconsistent condom use. There were no significant differences in these associations by gender, with the exception of food insufficiency, which increased the risk of inconsistent condom use for young women but not for young men. None of these individual measures of socioeconomic status were associated with never use of a condom. The findings suggest that both household- and individual-level measures of socioeconomic status are important correlates of condom use and that individual economic resources play a crucial role in negotiations over the highest level of usage. The results highlight the importance of poverty in shaping sexual behavior, and, in particular, that increasing individual access to resources beyond the household, including ensuring access to food and providing educational and work opportunities, could prove to be effective strategies for decreasing the risk of HIV among youth. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","condom use; poverty; sexual behavior; socioeconomic status; sub-Saharan Africa; youth","Condoms; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Kenya; Male; Poverty; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Safe Sex; Sex Factors; Social Class; Urban Health; Young Adult; adult; article; condom; educational status; female; food deprivation; health hazard; household; human; income; juvenile; Kenya; life history; major clinical study; male; poverty; priority journal; sex difference; sexual behavior; social status; urban area","","","","","Population Studies and Training Center; UTRA; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R21HD053587); Brown University; University of Chicago; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Department of Sociology, University of Alabama at Birmingham","This paper us es data from the Urban Life among Youth in Kisumu Project directed by Nancy Luke, Brown University, Shelley Clark, McGill University, and Eliya Zulu, African Institute for Development Policy.

The special setting that we have chosen for the analysis - tea estates in the South Indian High Range - allows us to control nonparametrically for differences in income, access to health services, and patterns of morbidity across low caste and high caste households. In this controlled setting, low caste households spend more on their children's health than high caste households, reversing the pattern we would expect to find elsewhere in India. Moreover, health expenditures do not vary by gender within either caste group, in contrast once again with the male preference documented throughout the country. A simple explanation, based on differences in the returns to human capital across castes in the tea estates, is proposed to explain these striking results. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies (N range = 40,918–52,406 person-year observations), we found that female community directors outnumbered male directors in urban China but were much less common in rural areas. Female community directors had higher levels of human capital regardless of rural or urban location. Residents living in female-directed communities reported better mental health but not physical health or life satisfaction compared to those living in male-directed communities, and this association was most robust among rural women. For rural women, the mental health benefit of living in female-directed communities was partially explained by reduced personal experience of gender discrimination, suggesting that female leadership fosters ideational change toward women that lowers discriminatory behaviors among constituents. © American Sociological Association 2021.","adult health; China; community; gender discrimination; political leadership","Adult; China; Female; Humans; Leadership; Male; Mental Health; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population; adult; article; China; controlled study; drawing; female; human; human experiment; leadership; life satisfaction; major clinical study; male; mental health; panel study; personal experience; resident; rural area; sexism; China; rural population; socioeconomics; urban population","","","","","Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University, (P2C HD041020); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2CHD041025); City University of New York, CUNY; Pennsylvania State University, PSU, (P2C HD041025); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York under an Advanced Research Collaborative Fellowship to Hongwei Xu and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development under center grants to the Population Research Institute at the Pennsylvania State University (P2C HD041025) and the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University (P2C HD041020).

Background: Women are primary breadwinners in almost a third of heterosexual couples in the United States. Emerging research finds that female primary breadwinning (or men's economic dependency) is a threat to masculinity that has negative implications for men's midlife health. However, there is no quantitative evidence of the mechanisms linking men's economic dependency and health, particularly the role of stress, and whether men's gender ideology moderates this relationship. Method: Using two waves of Midlife in the United States data for men who remained with the same marital or cohabiting female partner between waves (N = 332), the authors estimate the relationship between men's economic dependency in Wave 1 and allostatic load in Wave 2. Results: There was no evidence of an association between men's economic dependency and higher allostatic load on average. However, gender ideology had a moderating influence; men's economic dependency was associated with higher allostatic load for those who espoused more traditional gender attitudes and lower allostatic load for those with the most egalitarian attitudes. Conclusion: The findings underscore the existence of multiple masculinities and suggest that economic dependence has a negative or positive influence on men's health depending on the meanings men attach to female primary breadwinning. © 2019 National Council on Family Relations","gender; income or wages; marriage and close relationships; midlife; provider role; stress","","","","","","Pennsylvania State University for Population Research Infrastructure; Population Research Institute; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (P2C HD041025)"," The authors would like to thank Léa Pessin for her helpful comments.

This article reviews the nascent literature on single women's sexual experiences at midlife, theoretical frameworks that have been employed, and key findings. Challenging the stereotype that single women in midlife are in sexual decline, research shows that many women embrace their newfound freedom, have increased agency in midlife, and have positive sexual experiences. Others face impediments to finding new partners and engaging in sexual activity, including the lasting effects of abuse from previous relationships and restrictive social norms. For some, sex becomes less important in midlife, often replaced by close relationships with family and friends. Research largely focuses on White, heterosexual women; research on the experiences of racial and sexual minorities and midlife women in the Global South is needed. © 2023 The Authors.

We used rich time diary data from a sample of 1568 South Indian adolescents to examine the relationships between any time spent with parents, parents’ residency status, and the time spent with non-parental family members. We found that adolescents with at least one non-resident parent spent significantly more time with siblings, on average, when compared to adolescents with resident parents. We further found that adolescents spent more time with siblings in educational activities, such as studying, when they had at least one non-resident parent. These findings point to the importance of considering non-parental family members in studies of family social capital, especially in low-and middle-income contexts. Our findings challenge resource dilution theories by demonstrating that siblings themselves act as resources, rather than simply competitors for parental resources. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper reports on findings from qualitative interviews with women in rural villages about their fertility decision-making. Specifically addressed are the reasons behind increasing son preference and the consequences of this change. Findings suggest that daughter aversion, fuelled primarily by the perceived economic burden of daughters due to the proliferation of dowry, is playing a larger role in fertility decision-making than son preference. The desire for a son is often trumped by the worry over having many daughters. Women use various means of controlling the sex of their children, which in this study appear to be primarily female infanticide.

One prominent hypothesis is that open defecation in the local area exposes children to human fecal pathogens that can cause diarrhea and malnutrition. Much of the existing research uses district-level measures of open defecation, which could mask important local-area variation. A second hypothesis is that animal fecal matter is a major source of exposure. This analysis tested these dual hypotheses using census data collected from 949 villages in Tamil Nadu, India, and a survey conducted in a random sample of 5,000 households in the same area. The final analytic sample consisted of 2,561 children aged 0–10 years. We estimated the association between the measures of village- and household-level open defecation, household livestock ownership, and child height-for-age Z-scores in a regression framework, controlling for potential confounders. Results revealed that village- and household-level open defecations are negatively associated with child height. There was an estimated difference of approximately 0.5 height-for-age Z-score between children living in villages with no open defecation and children in villages where all households practiced open defecation (P 5 0.001) and a 0.2 Z-score difference between children living in households that practiced open defecation and those living in households that did not (P 5 0.001). Livestock ownership was not associated with child height. Overall, the findings provide evidence on the centrality of open defecation in explaining persistent child malnutrition in India and the higher risk of exposure to human fecal pathogens compared with animal feces in the south Indian context. © 2024 American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","","Animals; Body Height; Child; Child, Preschool; Defecation; Diarrhea; Family Characteristics; Feces; Female; Humans; India; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Livestock; Male; Nutritional Status; Ownership; adult; aged; anthropometric parameters; Article; body height; child; child growth; child health; cross-sectional study; defecation; demographics; economic status; educational status; exposure; family structure; feces analysis; feces microflora; female; food access; food insecurity; health disparity; health service; health survey; household; household income; human; hypothesis; India; livestock; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; nutritional status; open defecation; organization and management; outcome variable; prevalence; rural area; social status; socioeconomics; Tamil Nadu; urban area; animal; diarrhea; epidemiology; feces; infant; newborn; organization and management; preschool child","","","","","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Population Studies and Training Center, Brown University, PSTC; South India Community Health Study; University of Cambridge; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (01 HD058831-01); National Institutes of Health, NIH","Financial support: The South India Community Health Study (SICHS) was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the NIH (01 HD058831-01); the Keyes Fund at the University of Cambridge; and the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University.

Analysis of 49 semistructured interviews and survey data from 3,181 female workers revealed that although women were mainly responsible for domestic labor, more than half of husbands usually or sometimes helped their wives with cooking, fuel wood collection, and child care. The analyses revealed a curvilinear relationship between husbands' earnings share and their participation in each task, supporting theories of bargaining and gender display. The probability of male participation decreased to its lowest level when men earned less than their wives. Husbands rarely helped with clothes washing-considered the most feminine task-and their participation did not respond to changes in relative earnings. These results support the authors' argument that patterns of bargaining and gender display will vary depending on the gendered nature of housework tasks within a particular society. © National Council on Family Relations, 2014.","Families and work; Gender; Housework/division of labor; Non-U.S. families","","","","","","","","Agarwal B., Bargaining"" and gender relations: Within and beyond the household, Feminist Economics, 3, pp. 1-51, (1997); Beegle K., Frankenberg E., Thomas D., Bargaining power within couples and use of prenatal and delivery care in Indonesia, Studies in Family Planning, 32, pp. 130-146, (2001); Bhalla V., Couch potatoes and super-women"": Gender, migration, and the emerging discourse on housework among Asian Indian immigrants, Journal of American Ethnic History, 27, pp. 71-99, (2008); Bianchi S.M., Robinson J.P., Milkie M.A., Changing rhythms of American family life, (2006); Bittman M., England P., Folbre N., Sayer L., Matheson G., When does gender trump money?

This paper exploits a unique setting - a group of tea plantations in South India where women are employed in permanent wage labor and where incomes do not vary by caste - to anticipate the impact of globalization on mobility across social groups in the future. The main result of the paper is that a relative increase in female income weakens the family's ties to the ancestral community and the traditional economy, but these mobility enhancing effects are obtained for certain historically disadvantaged castes alone. Although the paper provides a context-specific explanation for why the women from these castes emerge as agents of change, the first general implication of the analysis is that the incentive and the ability of women to use their earnings to influence household decisions depends importantly on their social background. The second implication is that historically disadvantaged groups may, in fact, be especially responsive to new opportunities precisely because they have fewer ties to the traditional economy to hold them back. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Caste; Education; Female income; Gender; Globalization; Household decisions; Marital violence; Marriage; Mobility; Networks","India; developing world; economic development; gender issue; globalization; income distribution; labor mobility; marriage; womens employment; womens status","","","","","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD046940); Andrew W.

Center for Research on Women, Washington, DC, United States","Luke N., Intl. Center for Research on Women, Washington, DC, United States","This literature review assesses the extent of age mixing and economic transactions in the sexual relationships of adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa and the behavioral dynamics of girls and men involved in these partnerships. The examination of more than 45 quantitative and qualitative studies finds that relationships with older partners and those that involve economic transactions are common and that these asymmetries are associated with unsafe sexual behaviors and increased risk of HIV infection. Although the reasons that adolescent girls engage in sexual relationships with older men are varied, receipt of financial benefits is a major motivation. The literature presents evidence that girls have considerable negotiating power over certain aspects of sexual relationships with older men, including partnership formation and continuation; however, they have little control over sexual practices within partnerships, including condom use and violence. The review discusses directions for further research and the implications of current knowledge for future interventions.","","Africa; sub-Sahara; age; economic activity; gender relations; sexual behavior; young population","","","","","","","Abang M., Promoting HIV/AIDS prevention on Nigerian campuses: Students take the lead, AIDScaptions, 3, 3, (1996); Adepoju A., Mbugua W., The African family: An overview of changing forms, Family, Population and Development in Africa, pp. 41-59, (1997); Female Adolescent Health and Sexuality in Kenyan Secondary Schools: A Survey Report, (1994); Akuffo F.O., Teenage pregnancies and school drop-outs: The relevance of family life education and vocation training to girls' employment opportunities, Sex Roles, Population and Development in West Africa, pp. 154-164, (1987); Barker G.K., Rich S., Influences on adolescent sexuality in Nigeria and Kenya: Findings from recent focus-group discussions, Studies in Family Planning, 23, 3, pp. 199-210, (1992); Blanc A., Wolff B., Gender and decision-making over condom use in two districts in Uganda, African Journal of Reproductive Health, 5, 3, pp. 15-28, (2001); Bohmer L., Kirumira E., Access to reproductive heath services: Participatory research with adolescents for control of STDS, Working Paper Summary, (1997); Caldwell J.C., Rethinking the African AIDS epidemic, Population and Development Review, 26, 1, pp. 117-135, (2000); Caldwell J.C., Caldwell P., Women's position and child mortality and morbidity in less developed countries, Women's Position and Demographic Change, (1993); Caldwell J.C., Caldwell P., Quiggin P., The social context of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, Population and Development Review, 15, 2, pp. 185-234, (1989); Caldwell J.C., Caldwell P., Ankrah E.M., Anarfi J.K., Agyeman D.K., Awusabo-Asare K., Orubuloye I.O., African families and AIDS: Context, reactions and potential interventions, Health Transition Review, 3, SUPPL., pp. 1-16, (1993); Calves A.-E., Condom use and risk perceptions among male and female adolescents in cameroon: Qualitative evidence from Edea, Research Division Working Paper No. 22, (1999); Calves A.-E., Meekers D., Gender differentials in premarital sex, condom use, and abortion: A case study of Yaoundé, Cameroon, Research Division Working Paper No. 10, (1997); Calves A.-E., Cornwell G.T., Enyegue P.E., Adolescent sexual activity in sub-Saharan Africa: Do men have the same strategies and motivations as women?, Population Research Institute Working Paper AD96-04, (1996); Casterline J.B., Williams L., McDonald P., The age difference between spouses: Variation among developing countries, Population Studies, 40, 3, pp. 353-374, (1986); Clark S., Early Marriage and HIV Risks in Sub-Saharan Africa, (2002); Dinan C., Sugar daddies and gold-diggers: The white-collar single women in Accra, Female and Male in West Africa, pp. 344-366, (1983); Feldman D.A., O'Hara P., Baboo K.S., Chitalu N.W., Lu Y., HIV prevention among Zambian adolescents: Developing a value utilization/norm change model, Social Science and Medicine, 44, 4, pp. 455-468, (1997); Fuglesang M., Lessons for life-Past and present modes of sexuality education in Tanzanian society, Social Science and Medicine, 44, 8, pp. 1245-1254, (1997); Gage A.J., Sexual activity and contraceptive use: The components of the decisionmaking rocess, Studies in Family Planning, 29, 2, pp. 154-166, (1998); Gage A.J., Bledsoe C., The effects of education and social stratification on marriage and the transition to parenthood in Freetown, Sierra Leone, Nuptiality in Sub-Saharan Africa, pp. 148-164, (1994); Gersovitz M., A preface to the economic analysis of disease transmission, Australian Economic Papers, 39, 1, pp. 68-83, (2000); Glynn J.R., Carael M., Auvert B., Kahindo M., Chege J., Musonda R., Kaono F., Buve A., Why do young women have a much higher prevalence of HIV than young men?
