We describe a decline in men’s marriageability caused by their falling economic prospects at the same time as families of brides are increasingly seeking grooms with stable employment. We group young men into those without jobs or much education, those with education but no work, and the privileged few with education as well as employment. This classification resolves some of the seeming contradictions in the qualitative literature on marriage in India. Some of this literature talks about the rising prevalence of bride price and some about the persistence of dowry, while some papers reflect in general on the costs of being young, male, and aimless. Our commentary includes a review of the growing literature on the physiological and (perhaps) consequently behavioural and health outcomes of men’s anomie. © 2022 Population Investigation Committee.","age at marriage; bride price; dowry; gender; India; marriage squeeze; NEETS; unemployment; young men; youth bulge","Educational Status; Employment; Humans; India; Male; Marriage; Prevalence; India; abortion; cultural identity; cultural influence; gender relations; marriage; young population; educational status; employment; human; India; male; marriage; prevalence","","","","","","","Abraham L., Bhai-behen, true love, time pass: Friendships and sexual partnerships among youth in an Indian metropolis [Brother-sister, true love, time pass: Friendships and sexual partnerships among youth in an Indian metropolis], Culture, Health & Sexuality, 4, 3, pp. 337-353, (2002); Ahlawat N., Missing brides in rural Haryana: A study of adverse sex ratio, poverty and addiction, Social Change, 39, 1, pp. 46-63, (2009); Allendorf K., Pandian R.K., The decline of arranged marriage?

However, this paper finds that, almost hidden from the public gaze, a small but significant segment of the Indian population has begun the transition to extremely low fertility. Among the urban, upper income, educated, middle class, it is no longer unusual to find families stopping at one child, even when this child is a girl. Using data from the India Human Development Survey of 2004–2005, we examine the factors that may lead some families to stop at a single child. We conclude that the motivations for this very low fertility are likely to be a more extreme form of those for low fertility rather than reflecting the qualitative change in ideologies and worldviews that is hypothesized to accompany very low fertility during the second demographic transition. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","demographic transition; education; India; low fertility; middle class","India; class; demographic transition; education; family planning; fertility; human development index; ideology; socioeconomic status","","","","","","","Abbasi-Shavazi M.J., Hosseini-Chavoshi M., McDonald P., The path to below replacement fertility in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Asia-Pacific Population Journal, 22, 2, pp. 91-112, (2007); Agrawal P.K., Unisa S., (2002); Bacci L., Massimo.

She once explained in great detail the mechanics of taking the contraceptive pill to the wife in a couple that had come to the clinic for birth control help. Several weeks later, the couple was back, greatly upset that the wife was pregnant. When my acquaintance asked if the pill taking instructions had been strictly followed, the husband took umbrage at her suspicious questioning and declared that he had been most particular about taking the pill with breakfast every morning for 3 weeks and beginning the cycle again after a gap of 1 week. In other words, he had manfully assumed that my friend’s advice had been meant for him as he was the household head, and that she had been looking at his wife as she spoke only because she was a well-brought up South Asian woman who did not lock eyes with strange men. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Heavy Menstrual Bleeding; Reproductive Health; Reproductive Health Issue; South Asian Woman; Vaginal Discharge","","","","","","","","Abraham L., Bhai-behen, true love, time pass: Friendships and sexual partnerships among Youth in an Indian Metropolis, Culture, Health and Sexuality, 4, 3, pp. 337-353, (2002); Amin S., The Sociocultural and Political Aspects of Abortion, pp. 153-166, (2003); Anarfi J., The role of local herbs in the recent fertility decline in Ghana: Contraceptives or abortifacients?, The Sociocultural and Political Aspects of Abortion, pp. 139-152, (2003); Baker D.W., Gazmararian J.A., Scott T., Parker R.M., Ren D.J., Peel J., Functional health literacy and the risk of hospital admission among Medicare managed care enrollees, American Journal of Public Health, 92, 8, pp. 1278-1283, (2002); The Social and Political Context of Abortion, (2003); Basu A.M., Ultramodern contraception: Social class and family planning in India, Asian Population Studies, 1, 3, pp. 303-323, (2005); Basu A.M., The emotions and reproductive health, Population and Development Review, 32, 1, pp. 107-121, (2006); Bulut A., Et al., Contraceptive choice and reproductive morbidity in Istanbul, Studies in Family Planning, 28, 1, pp. 35-43, (1997); Caldwell J.C., Reddy P.H., Caldwell P., The causes of demographic change in rural South India: A micro approach, Population and Development Review, 8, 4, pp. 689-727, (1982); Collumbien M., Bohidar N., Das R., Das B., Pelto P., Male sexual health concerns in Orissa – An emic perspective.

Domestic servants have fewer numbers of ever-born and living children than women working in other occupations and women who are unemployed. This low fertility, which appears to be volitional, may have its roots in the incompatibility between the servant's reproductive and productive roles, as well as in the changing values generated by continued exposure to a wealthier lifestyle. It is suggested that family planning messages aimed at and elicited by more ""elite' classes may have a greater impact on fertility behavior than messages from prompters with a socioeconomic background similar to the clients', which tend to concentrate on the harsher day-to-day realities of poverty. -Authors","","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Family Characteristics; Family Planning; Female; Fertility; Human; India; Middle Age; Socioeconomic Factors; Sterilization, Sexual; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Women; Women, Working; India; Asia; Aspirations; Behavior; Case Studies; Caste; Contraception; Contraceptive Usage; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Dual Income Family; Economic Factors; Employment Status; Employment-based Services; Family And Household; Family Characteristics; Family Planning; Fertility; India; Informal Sector; Macroeconomic Factors; Migration; Occupational Status; Population; Population Dynamics; Psychological Factors; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Southern Asia; Studies; Women's Status; caste; family planning messages; female domestic servants; fertility behavior; socioeconomic background; adolescent; adult; age; article; Asia; Aspirations; behavior; Case Studies; contraception; Contraceptive Usage; Demographic Factors; developing country; Dual Income Family; Economic Factors; Employment Status; Employment-based Services; Family And Household; family planning; family size; female; fertility; human; India; Informal Sector; Macroeconomic Factors; migration; Occupational Status; population; population dynamics; psychological aspect; Psychological Factors; Research Methodology; Rural-urban Migration; social class; social status; socioeconomics; Southern Asia; Studies; utilization review; Women's Status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00393665","","","3188134","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024164607"

This report presents the results of a study in India of two distinct regional groups of similar socioeconomic status, residing in the same locality and, therefore, theoretically exposed to the same health services. Both groups share a strong faith in modern medicine for the treatment of most common illnesses. However, important cultural differentials exist in the medical services sought for childbirth and in the treatment of morbidity in children of different ages and sexes. These cultural commonalities and differentials are described, their possible causes - primary among these being the status of women - explored, and some policy recommendations made. -from Author","","Aged; Attitude to Health; Child; Child Care; Child, Preschool; Cultural Characteristics; Female; Health Services; Health Services Accessibility; Home Childbirth; Human; India; Infant; Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Male; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Self Medication; Sex Factors; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Women, Working; India; Age Factors; Asia; Child Health Services; Comparative Studies; Cultural Background; Delivery; Delivery Of Health Care; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Diseases; Economic Factors; Health; Health Services; Immunization; India; Intermediate Variables; Maternal Health Services; Maternal-child Health Services; Morbidity; Organization And Administration; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Primary Health Care; Program Acceptability; Program Evaluation; Programs; Reproduction; Research Methodology; Rural Population; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Southern Asia; Studies; Women's Status; childbirth; childhood illness; cultural differential; cultural influences; developing country; health care availability; health care utilisation; infant mortality; policy recommendation; regional group; service utilisation; socio-economic status; women's status; age; aged; article; Asia; attitude; child; child care; child health care; Comparative Studies; Cultural Background; cultural factor; delivery; Demographic Factors; developing country; Diseases; Economic Factors; ethnology; female; health; health care delivery; health care quality; health service; home delivery; human; immunization; India; infant; Intermediate Variables; male; Maternal-child Health Services; methodology; morbidity; organization and management; patient attitude; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; preschool child; primary health care; Program Acceptability; Programs; reproduction; Research Methodology; rural population; self medication; sex difference; socioeconomics; Southern Asia; Studies; utilization review; Women's Status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00393665","","","2237996","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025571815"

Twenty-two outcomes are investigated, representing child mortality and morbidity, illness management, service utilization and health behaviours. Maternal education is a significant correlate of each of the outcomes, and even low levels of education increase child survival prospects and health-related behaviours, except for neonatal mortality and the effective management of diarrhoea. We speculate on some of the possible mechanisms behind such impressive findings and suggest that rather than female autonomy, it may be the 'hidden curriculum' values of discipline and obedience of authority that account for them. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine various intermediate mechanisms for this relationship and conclude that a shortage of time is one of the major reasons for this negative relation between maternal employment and child survival. However, even in the area of child survival, there is one aspect which is positively affected by female employment: the disadvantage to girls in survival which is characteristic of South Asia seems to be smaller among working mothers. This is in contrast to the effect of maternal education which may often have no clear relation to the sex ratio of childhood mortality even though absolute levels of child mortality are lower for educated mothers.","","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Care; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; Employment; Female; Humans; India; Male; Maternal Behavior; Middle Aged; Mortality; Mothers; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Survival Rate; Women, Working; adolescent; adult; article; child; child care; child welfare; comparative study; employment; female; human; India; male; maternal behavior; middle aged; mortality; mother; preschool child; sex difference; socioeconomics; statistics; survival rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10364005","","","10148805","English","Health Transit Rev","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026143332"

Moreover, it might worsen further if we achieve the highly desirable goal of eliminating child labour and the ultimately justifiable goal of reducing old-age labour, unless there is a major rise in working age labour force participation and/or productivity.","","","","","","","","","Aiyar S., Mody A., The Demographic Dividend: Evidence from the Indian States, (2011); Bailey M., More power to the pill: The impact of contraceptive freedom on women's labour supply, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 121, (2006); Bloom D., Canning D., Contraception and the celtic tiger, The Economic and Social Review, 34, (2003); Bloom D.E., Canning D., Demographic change and economic growth: The role of cumulative causality, Matters: Demographic Change, Economic Growth and Poverty in the Developing World, (2001); Bloom D.E., Canning D., Sevilla J., The Demographic Dividend: A New Perspective on the Economic Consequences of Demographic Change, (2003); Bloom D., Williamson J., Demographic transitions and economic miracles in emerging asia, World Bank Economic Review, 12, (1998); Bloom D., Canning D., Malaney P., Demographic change and economic growth in Asia, Population and Development Review, 26, (2000); Chandrasekhar C.P., Ghosh J., Roychodhury A., The 'demographic dividend' and young india's economic future, Economic & Political Weekly, 41, (2006); Desai N., Demographic Dividend or Debt?, (2010); Desai S., The other half of the demographic dividend, Economic & Political Weekly, 45, (2011); James K.S., Glorifying malthus: Current debate on 'demographic dividend' in India, Economic & Political Weekly, 43, (2008)","A.M.

The article concludes that in fact rates of birth and death (especially at the older ages) have fallen in spite of the persistence of cultural norms and practices that limit female autonomy and that should therefore theoretically favour high fertility and mortality. It is suggested that at this stage of the state's demographic transition it might be more useful to look for causes in the relatively remarkable economic prosperity that the area has witnessed in the last two decades. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","","India, Punjab;

The article examines the historical origins and spread of ""modern"" ideas in Bangladesh and the state of West Bengal in India. It concludes that a colonial history in which education and modernization processes took hold very early among the elites in the larger Bengal region was paradoxically accompanied by a strong allegiance to the Bengali language. This strong sense of language identity has facilitated and reinforced the diffusion of modern ideas both within and between the two Bengali-speaking regions. Thus, to understand the fertility decline in Bangladesh, for example, one needs to look also at cultural boundaries. In this case, the cultural commonality through language facilitates the spread of new ideas across the two Bengals. In turn, the strong sense of language identity has facilitated mass mobilization more easily and intensely within the two Bengals. Shaped by these processes, Bangladesh and West Bengal today are more amenable to social change than many other parts of South Asia and the Middle East.","","Bangladesh; India; West Bengal; cultural influence; demographic trend; fertility; language","","","","","","","Adnan S., Fertility under absolute poverty: Paradoxical aspects of demographic change in Bangladesh, Economic and Political Weekly, 33, 22, pp. 1337-1348, (1998); Ahmed R., The Bengal Muslims 1871-1906: A Quest for Identity, (1996); Ahmed R., Haggblade S., Chowdhury T., Out of the Shadow of Famine: Evolving Food Markets and Food Policy in Bangladesh, (2000); Akter Banu U.A.B.R., Islam in Bangladesh, (1992); Amin S., Lloyd C.B., Women's lives and rapid fertility decline: Some lessons from Bangladesh and Egypt, Policy Research Division Working Paper No. 117, (1998); Amin S., Basu A.M., Stephenson R., Spatial variation in contraceptive use in Bangladesh: Looking beyond the borders, Policy Research Division Working Paper No. 138, (2000); Amin S.N., The early Muslim Bhadramahila: The growth of learning and creativity, 1876 to 1939, From the Seams of History: Essays on Indian Women, (1997); Anderson B.R.

It looks at the representation of demographic research and policies in one form of public engagement, namely fiction-literature being an important way of transmitting the substance of a technical field of study to a lay public. Reviewing a sample of fictional writing that is clearly derived from a specialized knowledge of the subject of demography, the article finds it useful to classify this genre into two groups. The works in the first group tend to reproduce or reiterate the mainstream assumptions underlying the academic discipline, while those in the second group seem to take on board more recent criticisms of these assumptions, sometimes in unexpected ways. Readers, however, seem to react much more readily to thoseworks that repeat some of the 'bad' habits of the discipline.","","academic research; demography; population policy","","","","","","","Amin S., Basu A.M., Popular Perceptions of Emerging Influences on Mortality and Longevity in Bangladesh and West Bengal, Population Studies, 58, 3, pp. 357-363, (2004); Basu A.M., The Politicization of Fertility to Achieve Non-Demographic Objectives, Population Studies, 51, 1, pp. 5-18, (1997); Basu A.M., The Squabble that Never Ends: Religion and Fertility in the 2001 Census of India, Economic and Political Weekly, 39, 19, pp. 4294-4296, (2004); Basu A.M., The Emotions and Reproductive Health, Population and Development Review, 32, 1, pp. 107-121, (2006); Besteman C.L., Gusterson H., Why America's Top Pundits are Wrong: Anthropologists Talk Back, (2005); Bookman M.Z., Bookman A.S., Economics in Film and Fiction, (2009); Borooah V., Iyer S., 'Religion and Fertility in India: The Role of Son Preference and Daughter Aversion', (2004); Buchanan P., The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil our Country and Civilization, (2002); Burawoy M., For Public Sociology, American Sociological Review, 70, 1, pp. 4-29, (2005); Cain M., The Consequences of Reproductive Failure: Dependence, Mobility, and Mortality among the Elderly of Rural South Asia, Population Studies, 40, 3, pp. 375-388, (1986); Cohen J.E., Review of L.

The author discusses some of the complaints about population policy and family planning programs, then considers the substantive, ethical, and feasibility issues of population and reproductive health policy. The majority of the international population movement's (IPM) new agenda is motivated by goals which tend to be more sensitive to individual needs and human rights than earlier, more impersonal versions of population policy in the developing world. Critical academic examination of the old IPM forced the discussion of the meaning of population policy and population research as they relate to the new reproductive health approach. However, the new population policy approach is now itself ready to be examined internally with regard to its practical recommendations and its assessment of the population problem. An internal critique developed by the movement but drawing upon the experience of mainstream population research and policy will strengthen the movement and hone its ability to match methods to goals. Internal dissent within the movement needs to be aired.","","Child; Ethics; Family Planning Services; Female; Health Policy; Human Rights; Humans; Infant; Organizational Objectives; Population Control; Pregnancy; World Health; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Economic Factors; Family Planning; Family Planning Programs; Health; International Agencies; Needs; Organizations; Policy; Population Control; Population Policy; Reproductive Health; Social Policy; Un; World; World Population Conferences; child; developed country; developing country; Economic Factors; ethics; family planning; Family Planning Programs; female; health; health care policy; human; human rights; infant; international cooperation; Needs; organization; organization and management; policy; population dynamics; Population Policy; pregnancy; reproductive health; review; Un; World; World Population Conferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10364005","","","10176799","English","Health Transit Rev","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031302874"

Multilevel analyses that control for variations in individual-and household-level correlates show an important role for cross-border influences only in those districts that share a common language across the border. The districts that are positive outliers in contraception hug the Bangladesh-West Bengal border. A map of outliers shows that the positive outliers form a contiguous band in a manner suggestive of a role for contagion.","","Adolescent; Adult; Bangladesh; Birth Rate; Contraception; Cultural Characteristics; Demography; Family Characteristics; Female; Fertility; Humans; India; Social Change; adolescent; adult; article; Bangladesh; birth rate; contraception; cultural factor; demography; family size; female; fertility; human; India; social change; utilization review","","","","","","","Agadjanian V., Religion, social milieu and the contraceptive revolution in Sub-Saharan Africa, Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, (2000); Ahmed G., Schellstede W.P., Williamson N.E., Underreporting of contraceptive use in Bangladesh, International Family Planning Perspectives, 13, 4, pp. 136-140, (1987); Akin J.S., Rous J.J., Effect of provider characteristics on choice of contraceptive behavior: A two-equation full-information maximum-likelihood estimation, Demography, 34, pp. 513-523, (1997); Amin S., Diamond I., Steele F., Contraception and religious practice in Bangladesh, The Continuing Demographic Transition, pp. 268-289, (1997); Anderson B., Regional and cultural factors in the decline of marital fertility in Europe, The Decline of Fertility in Europe, pp. 293-313, (1986); Banerjee P., Hazarika S., Hussain M., Sammadar R., Indo-Bangladesh cross-border migration and trade, Economic and Political Weekly, 34, 36, pp. 2449-2451, (1999); Basu A.M., Amin S., Some preconditions for fertility decline in Bengal: History, language identity and an openness to innovations, Population Development Review, 26, pp. 761-794, (2000); Bongaarts J., Watkins S.C., Social interactions and contemporary fertility transitions, Population and Development Review, 22, pp. 639-682, (1996); Chaudhury S.K., Cross-border Trade Between India and Bangladesh, (1995); Choudhuri S., Calcutta, The Living City, (1990); Davies J., Evaluation of the Social Marketing Project, (1983); Diamond I., Tonkin P., Shafiqur Rahman A.P.M., Noor S.S., Spatial variation in contraceptive method use in Bangladesh, Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey Extended Analysis, pp. 136-157, (1997); Faaland J., Parkinson J.R., Bangladesh: The Test Case of Development, (1976); Franda M., Bangladesh: The First Decade, (1982); Goldstein H., Multi-level Statistical Model. 2nd Ed., (1995); Goldstein H., Healy M.J.R., The graphical representation of a collection of means, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A, 158, pp. 175-177, (1995); Granovetter M., The strength of weak ties, American Journal of Sociology, 73, pp. 1360-1380, (1973); Kaufman C.E., Contraceptive use in South Africa under apartheid, Demography, 35, pp. 421-434, (1998); Koenig M.A., Hossain M.B., Whittaker M., The influence of quality of care upon contraceptive use in rural Bangladesh, Studies in Family Planning, 28, pp. 278-289, (1997); Lesthaeghe R., The Decline of Belgian Fertility, 1800 to 1970, (1977); Liu W.T., Duff R.W., The strength in weak ties, Public Opinion Quarterly, 36, pp. 361-366, (1972); Bangladesh Contraceptive Prevalence Survey 1979, (1981); Bangladesh Contraceptive Prevalence Survey 1981, (1981); Mitra S.N., Kamal G.M., Bangladesh Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, 1983: Key Results, (1983); Montgomery M.R., Casterline J.B., The diffusion of fertility control in Taiwan: Evidence from pooled cross-section time-series models, Population Studies, 47, pp. 457-479, (1993); The Role of Diffusion Processes in Fertility Change in Developing Countries: Report of a Workshop, (1999); Pohit S., Taneja N., India's Informal Trade with Bangladesh and Nepal: A Qualitative Assessment, (2001); Rosero-Bixby L., Casterline J.B., Interaction diffusion and fertility transition in Costa Rica, Social Forces, 73, pp. 435-462, (1994); Rutenberg N., Watkins S.C., The buzz outside the clinic: Conversations and contraception in Nyanza Province, Kenya, Studies in Family Planning, 28, pp. 290-307, (1997); Schellstede W.P., Ciszewski R.L., Social marketing of contraceptives in Bangladesh, Studies in Family Planning, 15, pp. 30-39, (1984); Steele F., Amin S., Naved R., Savings/credit group formation and change in contraception, Demography, 38, pp. 267-282, (2001); Williamson N.E., Evaluation Needs of Bangladesh Family Planning Project, (1982); Wolpert S., A New History of India. 4th Ed., (1993)","S.

For one of these commitments, that to the notion of gender equality, greater strength and legitimacy is today commonly sought by tying it to other less controversial goals such as that of better health. But straining for connections between gender equality and positive health outcomes often unduly constrains the research question, the research methods, and the interpretation of the research. When health policy seeks guidance from this research, it can receive signals which are too often incomplete, silent on the many trade-offs of specific policy measures, and, ultimately, perhaps even detrimental to the very goals of gender equity and social justice from which they are derived. Examples of all these possibilities are discussed. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","demography; gender issue; health policy","","","","","","","Barrera A., The role of maternal schooling and its interaction with public health programs in child health production, Journal of Development Economics, 32, 1, pp. 69-91, (1990);

An analysis of data from a recent field study as well as a fresh look at information from secondary sources, leads to the conclusion that, at present, the causal link from malnutrition to mortality is ambiguous at best. Other possible real-world determinants of sex differences in mortality are examined and it is found that differential utilisation of modern health care is probably an important such determinant. Finally some of the socio-economic influences on sex discrimination in health care are examined and a case is presented for increasing women’s employment outside the home. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Asia; child mortality; food discrimination; health care; sex differential","","","","","Overseas Development Administration, (R3934); National Council of Applied Economic Research","Such overwhelming support for a proposition is rare and has naturally led to attempts to explain this departure from the expected results, if it is accepted that the female is biologically hardier than, or at least as hardy as the male. Populations have been disaggregated into various regional, social and economic groups and correlations established between such categories and sex differences in mortality (primarily infant and child mortality, as mortality at the reproductive ages depends on different factors, some of which are found in other parts of the world as well). Such exercises have led to the conclusion that the sex differential in infant and child mortality is greater among the higher castes and more propertied classes, 4 in groups where dowry constitutes an essential and large part of a girl's marriage expenses, 5 in areas where women are less economically active, 6 in areas of dry wheat cultivation v and in areas where village * The research described in this paper has been funded by the Overseas Development Administration, United Kingdom (Grant No. R3934 to the National Council of Applied Economic Research, New Delhi).

In this study in rural Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, which used individual interviews and focus-group discussions to investigate the changing costs of and motivations for reproduction, respondents were questioned about their perceptions of changes in mortality. The findings show that, while child mortality levels are perceived to have fallen dramatically in recent times, the health and survival prospects of the middle aged and the elderly are seen to have been better in the past. The perceived decline in adult health is attributed to environmental deterioration and lifestyle changes accompanying modernization.

However, contrary to our assumption that fertility declines in this region hinge on improvements in the status of women, declining fertility seems to be going hand in hand with worsening population sex ratios. This article examines the evidence for a causal connection between fertility decline and increasing gender imbalance by looking at differences in fertility and in gender inequalities between North and South India in the past, and their increasing convergence in gender inequalities in recent years. It pays special attention to the southern state of Tamil Nadu which has been in the forefront of the country's fertility decline but is nevertheless moving towards a North Indian pattern in many aspects of women's status. The Tamil Nadu example is a particularly striking way of studying the country-wide trend because it represents a break from the past, in contrast to North India, where increasing gender differentials may be seen more as an accentuation of long-existing trends. The main problem seems to be that pressures to lower fertility are occurring independently of a change in underlying son preferences and falls in fertility are being aided by technologies which allow one to manipulate not just the sex composition of living children, but also that of children as yet unborn. Some policy implications of this last situation are discussed.","","India; Tamil Nadu; demographic transition; fertility; gender relations","","","","","","","Bardhan P., Little girls and death, Economic and Political Weekly, 9, pp. 1293-1304, (1974);

That is, the first birth interval is much longer in the North. Standard socio-economic and biological reasons for this difference are found to provide incomplete and unsatisfactory explanations - instead, the longer first birth interval in North India is explained in terms of the marriage and kinship patterns in this area which lead to (i) lower frequency of intercourse and (ii) long periods of abstinence when the wife visits her parental home. Both these factors operate primarily during the first years of marriage and result in a convergence of the ages at first birth in the two regions. The argument, therefore, questions the correctness of policy prescriptions which equate early marriage with an early start of childbearing, and seek to control the latter by changing the former. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","India; age at first birth; age at marriage; birth interval; child-bearing; comparative studies; cultural factor; developing country; kinship; marriage; marriage age; population fertility; regional comparison","","","","","Overseas Development Administration","t Institute of Economic Growth, University Enclave, Delhi 110 007, India. * Earlier versions of this paper were presented at seminars at the Office of Population Research, Princeton University and the Department of Population Studies, London School of Economics.

The central proposition of this essay is that emotions are particularly important for understanding the problems of reproductive health. This understanding allows one to consider the usual determinants of personal autonomy, or access to knowledge or services, but also to take into account the fact that much sexual and reproductive behavior is motivated by emotional states that can suppress prior knowledge, services, or agency. The essay draws upon the emerging theoretical literature on emotions in the disciplines of sociology and anthropology to explore the role of emotions in behavior and outcomes related to reproductive health. It looks especially at the cultural meaning, the ideal, and the experienced reality of the emotion of 'love.' All these aspects of what is a positive emotion have important positive as well as negative implications for the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract problems and for unsafe sexual activity. © 2006 The Population Council, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Ali K.A., Planning the Family in Egypt: New Bodies, New Selves, (2002); Arnold F., Et al., The Value of Children: A Cross-national Study, 2, (1975); Berezin M., Emotions and the economy, Handbook of Economic Sociology, (2005); Brabin L., Et al., Reproductive tract infections, gynecological morbidity and HIV seroprevalence among women in Mumbai, India, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 76, pp. 277-287, (1998); Bulut A., Et al., Contraceptive choice and reproductive morbidity in Istanbul, Studies in Family Planning, 28, 1, pp. 35-43, (1997); Calhoun C., Solomon R.C., What Is an Emotion?, Classic Readings in Philosophical Psychology, (1984); Carstairs G.M., The Twice Born: A Study of a Community of High Caste Hindus, (1967); Dudgeon M.R., Inhorn M.C., Men's influences on women's reproductive health: Medical anthropological perspectives, Social Science and Medicine, 59, pp. 1379-1395, (2004); Dwyer R., Yeh shaadi nahin ho sakti!
