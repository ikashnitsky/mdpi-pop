However, comparatively little research and policy attention has been paid to drinking cultures among Asian people. A scoping review was undertaken to identify drinking patterns, alcohol-related harm, drinking culture among Asian youth, young adults, and adults living in New Zealand. A search of literature identified 39 relevant outputs. The findings indicated that Asian people enjoy a comparative health advantage when compared with non-Asian population groups through lower rates of alcohol consumption, less risky drinking, and experiencing less harm from drinking. Despite these advantages, the results identified areas where improvements with Asian people’s relationships and experiences with alcohol may be warranted. It is important to develop targeted approaches to Asian drinking that can build on the current whole population-level alcohol initiatives. Further research is warranted to identify specific and additional strategies to address problematic alcohol use in this cohort. © The Author(s) 2022.","alcohol use; Asians; drinking culture; harmful drinking; public health","","","","","","","","Adams J., Asiasiga L., Neville S., Drinking cultures of rainbow New Zealanders, (2019); Adams J., Asiasiga L., Neville S., Justifications for heavy alcohol use among gender and sexually diverse people, Global Public Health, 9, pp. 1-16, (2021); Alcohol and New Zealand youth: A snapshot of young people’s experiences with alcohol, (2004); Changes in Chinese youth health in New Zealand between 2001 and 2012, (2017); Changes in Indian youth health in New Zealand between 2001 and 2012, (2017); Ahmmad Z., Adkins D.E., Ethnicity and acculturation: Asian American substance use from early adolescence to mature adulthood, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 47, 19, pp. 4570-4596, (2021); Ajmal A., The recreational alcohol and substance use experiences of a sample of South Asian university students in New Zealand, (2012); Ameratunga S., Waayer D., Robinson E., Clark T.C., Crengle S., Denny S., Sheridan J., Teevale T., Youth’07: The health and wellbeing of secondary school students in New Zealand.

We explored rural women's perceptions and beliefs regarding barriers to vasectomy use in the low resource setting of Pwani, Tanzania. The qualitative study used in-depth semi-structured interviews to obtain data. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 married/cohabiting women with two or more children. Thematic analysis guided the data analysis, with qualitative data reporting informed by COREQ guidelines. Most participants were Muslim and had between two and six children. Most had completed primary-level education and were engaged in small-scale farming. We extracted three main themes with associated sub-themes:1) lack of education, which included men's education levels and inadequate knowledge and misinformation 2) religious beliefs, social pressure and stigma, which included community stigma and the belief that vasectomy was not good for men with multiple wives; and 3) promoting men's involvement in family planning which included educating men and the women's perceived role in promoting vasectomy. Participating women perceived vasectomy uptake to be affected by a lack of low knowledge (among men, women, and the community), misinformation, and various sociocultural barriers. Efforts to promote vasectomy and male involvement in reproductive health services should be directed to addressing deeply-rooted sociocultural barriers. Women may have an essential role in encouraging their partners' vasectomy uptake. In addition, engaging couples in family planning education is critical to enhance knowledge. Ideally, such community based education should be conducted in partnership with communities and healthcare providers. Copyright: © 2020 Pallangyo et al.

Family caregivers are crucial care resources for dependent older adults living in the community before transitioning to institutional services. However, understanding of their perceptions in supporting older adults with multimorbidity to cope with loneliness is limited. This qualitative study aimed to elucidate on the experiences of caring and explore the experiences and perceptions of family caregivers in supporting older community-dwelling adults with multimorbidity to cope with loneliness. Eleven family caregivers, aged 51–93 years old, with at least 2 years of caregiving experience were purposively recruited and interviewed individually. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist was utilised to report the study. Three key themes were generated from the inductive analysis: (1) recognising older adults' loneliness through the expression of unusual emotions, behaviour/s, social network alteration and speech; (2) variations in perceptions and responses to loneliness among different family caregiving relationships; and (3) challenges in addressing loneliness. Positive feedback from cared-for older adults was appreciated by their family caregivers which in turn motivated further actions to alleviate loneliness. The findings emphasised the importance of developing specific patients and family caregivers centred interventions, such as communication skills training to enhance effective communications. Cultural values and norms of individuals should be respected in those interventions, ensuring that emotional expression is facilitated in a comfortable way for both older patients and family caregivers. © 2024 The Author(s).

Methods: Some 158 FSW-NIDUs recruited from sex work venues and 218 FSW-IDUs recruited via the snowball sampling method were interviewed anonymously. Results: Only 16.5% of the FSW-IDUs and 51.3% of the FSW-NIDUs had used condoms consistently during commercial sex in the last month (odds ratio (OR)=0.19). Factors significantly associated with inconsistent condom use in both groups included: behavioural intention for condom use (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.05 and 0.13), condom unavailability (AOR=4.77 and 5.33), a perceived need to engage in unprotected sex if the client paid more (AOR=8.74 and 10.84) or insisted on demanding unprotected sex (AOR=19.78 and 7.59), and submissive gender power (AOR=11.65 and 2.58). One factor, perceived susceptibility (AOR=2.64), was significant only among FSW-NIDUs, whereas perceived efficacy of condom use in preventing HIV transmission (AOR=0.08), perceptions that peer FSWs would not use condoms with clients (AOR=2.23), self-hatred (AOR=2.25) and lack of social support (AOR=2.93) were significant only among FSW-IDUs. Injecting with used syringes was also associated with inconsistent condom use among FSW-IDUs (AOR=4.64). Conclusions: FSW-IDUs were more likely than FSW-NIDUs to possess the cognitive and psychosocial conditions associated with unprotected commercial sex. Interventions need to take these differences into account. © 2012 CSIRO.","health behavioural theories; HIV; psychological factors; sexually transmissible infections","Adult; China; Condoms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Prevalence; Prostitution; Risk Factors; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; adult; article; China; condom; disease transmission; drug abuse; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; injection; prevalence; prostitution; unsafe sex","","","","","","","Logan T.K., Cole J., Leukefeld C., Women, sex, and HIV: Social and contextual factors, meta-analysis of published interventions, and implications for practice and research, Psychol.

This qualitative study examined how DDS for infectious diseases (ID) was perceived and experienced by primary care physicians and patients in order to highlight ethical considerations for promoting patients’ autonomy and health care rights. METHODS In-depth interviews were conducted with a purposefully selected group of 16 primary care physicians and 24 of their patients. The group was reflective of a range of ages, educational attainment, and clinical experiences from urban areas in northern and southern China. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated. Two researchers coded data and organized it into themes. A third researcher reviewed 15% of the data and discussed findings with the other researchers to assure accuracy. RESULTS Five themes were identified: ambiguity around the need for informed consent with usage of DDS; importance of autonomous decision making; potential for discrimination against vulnerable users of DDS for ID; risk of social inequity and disparate care outcomes; and authoritarian institutions’ responsibility for maintaining health data security. The adoption of DDS meant some patients would be reluctant to go to the hospital for fear of either being discriminated against or forced into quarantine. Certain groups (older people and children) were thought to be vulnerable to DDS misappropriation. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate the paramount importance of establishing national and international ethical frameworks for DDS implementation. Frameworks should guide all aspects of ID surveillance, addressing privacy protection and health security, and underscored by principles of social equity and accountability. © 2023, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

Using a qualitative approach, we investigated how these frameworks operated as self-protective strategies for female sex workers to maintain their psychological and physical well-being under stressful socioeconomic and work-related conditions. Twenty-three female sex workers in Hong Kong participated in in-depth interviews. We used the grounded theory approach for data analysis. The informants reported negative feelings in response to financial burden, clients' demands, threats to physical health, and stigma. Some female sex workers showed their resilience by being able to rationalize their role, believe their ability to make a change in life, and stay optimistic.

This study was aimed at understanding the provision of MRH services in Siosar, a relocation site for a population displaced by the volcanic eruption in 2013 of Mount Sinabung, Indonesia. A qualitative case study approach was used, and data were collected through focus group discussions and individual interviews with women of reproductive age, community leaders, health personnel, and policymakers. The findings show that while considerable efforts were made to provide MRH services, these were described as “unfinished,” due to challenges such as changes to funding, inadequate provision of supplies and health personnel, and geographical location. Recommendations are that health and other sectors design a relocation site that counts physical, psychological, and social needs of a community and policymakers integrate humanitarian and development plans that include MRH services into World Health Organization’s Building Blocks of Health System. © 2021 APJPH.","health system strengthening; humanitarian-development nexus; maternal reproductive health; MRH; post-disaster","adult; article; disaster; female; funding; health care personnel; human; Indonesia; interview; leadership; reproductive health; social needs; volcano; World Health Organization","","","","","Government of North Sumatera Province; Karo District; Ministry of Health of Indonesia; National Disaster Management Authority of Indonesia; United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA; Universitas Sumatera Utara, USU","The authors would like to thank women, community leaders, health personnel, policymakers, participants, the Government of North Sumatera Province and Karo District, also Dr Rahayu Sanusi and staff from the Public Health Faculty of the University of North Sumatera.

We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 20 children (aged 6–15) who were partially to fully aware of their parents’ HIV status in rural Guangxi, China. Of the 20 children, eight children who were of older age (11.38 years in average) endorsed parental HIV disclosure, five discouraged it and seven expressed uncertainty. Children’s different experiences and attitudes towards disclosure were seen to be associated with their family dynamics (especially the parent–child relationship), social support and care, experiences of stigma and discrimination, psychosocial suffering, comprehension of the disease and the children’s age. Our study contributes to building a child-centered comprehensive understanding for Chinese parental HIV disclosure. It is imperative that counselors and community advocates assess and help parents achieve optimal readiness preceding disclosure of their illness to their HIV-negative children. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children; experience; HIV disclosure; parents; rural China","","","","","","","","Chaudoir S.R., Fisher J.D., Simoni J.M., Understanding HIV disclosure: A review and application of the disclosure processes model, Social Science & Medicine, 72, pp. 1618-1629, (2011); Cluver L., Gardner F., The psycholocial well-being of children orphaned by AIDS in Cape Town, South Africa, Annals of General Psychiatry, 5, (2013); (2014); Ding Y., Li L., Ji G., HIV disclosure in rural China: Predictors and relationship to access to care, AIDS Care, 23, 9, pp. 1059-1066, (2011); Green J., Thorogood N., Qualitative methods for health research, (2009); Hult J.R., Wrubel J., Branstrom R., Acree M., Moskowitz J.T., Disclosure and nondisclosure among people newly diagnosed with HIV: An analysis from a stress and coping perspective, AIDS Patient Care and STDs, 26, 3, pp. 181-190, (2012); Kennedy D.P., Cowgill B.O., Bogart L.M., Corona R., Ryan G.W., Murphy D.A., Schuster M.A., Parents’ disclosure of their HIV infection to their children in the context of the family, AIDS and Behavior, 14, pp. 1095-1105, (2010); Lesch A., Swartz L., Kagee A., Moodley K., Kafaar Z., Myer L., Cotton M., Paediatric HIV/AIDS disclosure: Towards a developmental and process-oriented approach, AIDS Care, 19, 6, pp. 811-816, (2007); Nam S.L., Fielding K., Avalos A., Gaolathe T., Dickinson D., Geissler P.W., Discussing matters of sexual health with children: What issues relating to disclosure of parental HIV status reveal, AIDS Care, 21, 3, pp. 389-395, (2009); Nostlinger C., Bartoli G., Gordillo V., Roberfroid D., Colebunders R., Children and adolescents living with HIV positive parents: Emotional and behavioural problems, Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies, 1, 1, pp. 29-43, (2006); Qiao S., Li X., Stanton B., Disclosure of parental HIV infection to children: A systematic review of global literature, AIDS and Behavior, 17, 1, pp. 369-389, (2013); Rochat T.J., Mkwanazi N., Bland R., Maternal HIV disclosure to HIV-uninfected children in rural South Africa: A pilot study of a family-based intervention, BMC Public Health, 13, (2013); Rwemisisi J., Wolff B., Coutinho A., Grosskurth H., Whitworth J., What if they ask how I got it?” Dilemmas of disclosing parental HIV status and testing children for HIV in Uganda, Health Policy and Planning, 23, 1, pp. 36-42, (2008); Saldana J., The coding manual for qualitative researchers, (2009); Simoni J.M., Davis M.L., Drossman J.A., Weinberg B.A., Mothers with HIV/AIDS and their children: Disclosure and guardianship issues, Women & Health, 31, pp. 39-54, (2000); Stenger C.E., Taking Tarasoff where no one has gone before: Looking at “duty to warn” under the AIDS crisis, St Louis University Public Law Review, 15, 2, pp. 471-504, (1996); Tiendrebeogo G., Hejoaka F., Belem E.M., Compaore P.L., Wolmarans L., Soubeiga A., Ouangraoua N., Parental HIV disclosure in Burkina Faso: Experiences and challenges in the era of HAART, SAHARA-J: Journal of Social Aspects of HIV/AIDS, 10, pp. S46-S59, (2013); Guideline on HIV disclosure counselling for children up to 12 years of age, (2011); Xu T., Wu Z., Rou K., Duan S., Wang H., Quality of life of children living in HIV/AIDS-affected families in rural areas in Yunnan, China, AIDS Care, 22, 3, pp. 390-396, (2010); Xu T., Yan Z., Duan S., Wang C., Rou K., Wu Z., Psychosocial well-being of children in HIV/AIDS-affected families in Southwest China: A qualitative study, Journal of Child and Family Studies, 18, pp. 21-30, (2009); Xu T., Yan Z., Rou K., Wang C., Ye R., Duan S., Wu Z., Disclosure of parental HIV/AIDS to children in rural China, Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies, 2, 2, pp. 100-105, (2007); Zea M.C., Reisen C.A., Poppen P.J., Bianchi F.T., Echeverry J.J., Predictors of disclosure of human immunovirus-positive serostatus among Latino gay men, Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 13, 4, pp. 304-312, (2007); Zhang L., Li X., Zhao J., Zhao G., Kaljee L., Stanton B., Disclosure of parental HIV infection to children and psychosocial impact on children in China: A qualitative study, Asia Pacific Journal of Counselling and Psychotherapy, 4, pp. 163-174, (2013)","H.

Method: The qualitative descriptive approach taken in this study involved 17 individual face-to-face interviews of older Filipino migrants in New Zealand. Results: Three main themes emerged from the data. The first theme was “moving backwards and moving forward”, which described how these older Filipino migrants adjusted to challenges they experienced with migration. The second theme was “engaging with health services” and presented challenges relating to the New Zealand healthcare system, including a lack of knowledge of the nature of health services, language barriers, and differences in cultural views. The third theme, “new-found home”, highlighted establishing a Filipino identity in New Zealand and adjusting to the challenges of relocation. Conclusion: Adjustment to life in New Zealand for these older Filipino migrants meant starting over again by building new values through learning the basics and then moving forward from there. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adjustment; Filipinos; Life experiences; New Zealand; Older migrants; Qualitative","Acculturation; Aged; Communication Barriers; Delivery of Health Care; Emigrants and Immigrants; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Philippines; Qualitative Research; Social Identification; Transients and Migrants; health care system; human; human experiment; identity; interview; language; migrant; New Zealand; personal experience; aged; attitude to health; communication barrier; cultural factor; ethnology; female; health care delivery; health service; learning; male; middle aged; migration; New Zealand; Philippines; qualitative research; social behavior","","","","","","","Aelbrecht K., Pype P., Vos J., Deveugele M., Having cancer in a foreign country, Patient Education and Counselling, 99, 10, pp. 1708-1716, (2016); Al Abed N.A., Davidson P.M., Hickman L.D., Healthcare needs of older Arab migrants: A systematic review, Journal of Clinical Nursing, 23, pp. 1770-1784, (2014); Alpass F., Flett R., Trlin A., Henderson A., North N., Skinner M., Wright S., Psychological wellbeing in three groups of skilled immigrants to New Zealand, Australian Journal of Rehabilitation Counselling, 73, 1, pp. 1-13, (2007); Ball R., Divergent development, racialised rights: Globalised labour markets and the trade of nurses-The case of the Philippines, Women’s Studies International Forum, 27, 2, (2004); Berry J.W., Acculturation and adaptation: Health consequences of culture contact among circumpolar peoples, Arctic Medical Research, 49, 3, pp. 142-150, (1990); Bolzman C., Fibbi R., Vial M., What to do after retirement?

The study aimed to contribute to the prevention of workplace violence against medical staff in China by identifying patterns of workplace violence, key risk factors, and the interplay of risk factors that result in workplace violence. Methods: Ninety-seven publicly reported Chinese healthcare violent incidents from late 2013 to 2017 were retrospectively collected from the internet and analysed using content analysis. A modified socio-ecological model guided analysis of the violent incidents focusing on risk. Results: Physical violence, yinao, or a combination of physical and verbal violence were the typical forms of violence reported. The findings identified risk at all levels. Individual level risk factors included service users’ unreasonable expectations, limited health literacy, mistrust towards medical staff, and inadequacy of medical staff’s communication during the medical encounter. Organisational level risk factors under the purview of hospital management included problems with job design and service provision system, inadequacies with environmental design, security measures, and violence response mechanisms within hospitals. Societal level risk factors included lack of established medical dispute-handling mechanisms, problems in legislation, lack of trust and basic health literacy among service users. Situational level risks were contingent on risk factors on the other levels: individual, organisational, and societal. Conclusions: Interventions at individual, situational, organisational, and societal levels are needed to systematically address workplace violence against medical staff in China. Specifically, improving health literacy can empower patients, increase trust in medical staff and lead to more positive user experiences. Organizational-level interventions include improving human resource management and service delivery systems, as well as providing training on de-escalation and violence response for medical staff. Addressing risks at the societal level through legislative changes and health reforms is also necessary to ensure medical staff safety and improve medical care in China. © 2023, The Author(s).","China; Communication; Healthcare; Management; Patient experience; Patient-centred care; Physician-patient relations; Socio-ecological model; Trust; Workplace violence","China; Humans; Medical Staff; Patients; Retrospective Studies; Workplace; Workplace Violence; adult; article; China; content analysis; expectation; female; health care delivery; health literacy; hospital management; human; Internet; law; major clinical study; male; medical care; medical staff; patient care; physical violence; physician; resource management; retrospective study; risk factor; security; trust; verbal hostility; violence; workplace violence; China; epidemiology; medical staff; patient; prevention and control; retrospective study; workplace","","","","","","","Chen S., Et al., Workplace violence and its effect on burnout and turnover attempt among chinese medical staff, Arch Environ Occup Health, 71, 6, pp. 330-337, (2016); Report on the working condition of Chinese medical practitioners, Association CMD, (2015); Gong Y., Et al., Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and related risk factors among physicians in China: a cross-sectional study, PLoS ONE, 9, 7, (2014); Jiao M., Et al., Workplace violence against nurses in chinese hospitals: a cross-sectional survey, BMJ open, 5, 3, (2015); Yang S.Z., Et al., Workplace violence and its aftermath in China’s health sector: implications from a cross-sectional survey across three tiers of the health system, BMJ open, 9, 9, pp. e031513-e31513, (2019); Notes on serious patient-doctor violent incidents in recent years in mainland China [in Chinese], China, (2012); Arnetz J.E., Et al., Understanding patient-to-worker violence in hospitals: a qualitative analysis of documented incident reports, J Adv Nurs, 71, 2, pp. 338-348, (2015); Cooper C., Swanson N., Workplace violence in the health sector State of the art.

Despite its huge economic implications, the lack of smoking and associated lifestyle-related data on China's outpatients makes it difficult for health care professionals to provide individualized assessments and targeted interventions. This study aimed to identify factors to inform nurse-led smoking behavioral assessments and cessation interventions. Clinical data from new patients attending the family medicine outpatient department from a large tertiary hospital in a major Southern China city were collected between March and December 2015. Data including basic demographics, medical history, vaccination history, current medication, and information on lifestyle risk factors were collected by frontline nurses during nursing assessment on their initial visit. Chi-square and Student's t tests were used as univariate analysis and post hoc regression analysis to explore which factors contributed toward smoking cessation. Of 7913 eligible visits, smokers and ex-smokers accounted for 13.5% and 2.4% of new patients, respectively, with a majority of them being young and male (gender ratio of 8:1) smokers. Multiple behavioral risks and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus in smokers were common; for example, 17.9% of smokers were also current drinkers, making alcohol users 8.5 to 16.7 times more likely to have smoked. Ex-smokers were more likely to be divorced, to be ex-drinkers, or to have higher diastolic blood pressure and concurrent hypertension. Smoking and associated lifestyle risk assessments run by registered nurses should be incorporated into current outpatient health histories and in targeted smoking cessation intervention programs. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","China; cigarette smoking; nursing assessment; risk behavior","Adult; China; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurse's Role; Nurses; Risk Reduction Behavior; Smoking Cessation; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; China; female; human; male; middle aged; nurse; nurse attitude; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; risk reduction; smoking cessation; statistics and numerical data","","","","","","","Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020, (2013); NCDs: China, (2013); Fact Sheet China, (2010); Yang L., Sung H.Y., Mao Z., Hu T.W., Rao K., Economic costs attributable to smoking in China: Update and an 8-year comparison, 2000-2008, Tob Control., 20, 4, pp. 266-272, (2011); Qiu Q.L., Duan Y., Cui J., Smokers Refusing to Pack It in, (2011); Stead L.F., Perera R., Bullen C., Mant D., Lancaster T., Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation, Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 1, (2008); Li Q., Hsia J., Yang G., Prevalence of smoking in China in 2010, New Eng J Med., 364, 25, pp. 2469-2470, (2011); Zhang J., Ou J.X., Bai C.X., Tobacco smoking in China: Prevalence, disease burden, challenges and future strategies, Respirology., 16, 8, pp. 1165-1172, (2011); Friend K.B., Pagano M.E., Smoking cessation and alcohol consumption in individuals in treatment for alcohol use disorders, J Addict Dis., 24, 2, pp. 61-75, (2005); Shea L., Frische N.C., Application of integral theory in holistic nursing practice, Holist Nurs Prac., 28, 6, pp. 344-352, (2014); The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, (2005); WHO Update on Smoking, (2013); Abdullah A.S., Yang T., Beard J., Predictors of women's attitudes toward world health organization framework convention on tobacco control policies in urban China, J Womens Health., 19, 5, pp. 903-909, (2010); Tobacco in China, (2012); Shenzhen Population Statistics; China's Top 10 Largest Cities, (2015); Tudor Hart J., The inverse care law, Lancet., 297, 7696, pp. 405-412, (1971); Islami F., Torre L.A., Jemal A., Global trends of lung cancer mortality and smoking prevalence, Translat Lung Cancer Res., 4, 4, (2015); Sarna L., Bialous S.A., Zou X.N., Et al., Helping smokers quit: Behaviours and attitudes of Chinese registered nurses, J Adv Nurs., 72, 1, pp. 107-117, (2016); Zuzelo P.R., Smokers' guilt and shame: Reactions to smoking and to providers' cessation efforts, Holist Nurs Pract., 31, 5, pp. 353-355, (2017); Tointon K., Hunt J., How holistic nursing can enhance the quality of life of children with cystic fibrosis, Nurs Child Young People., 28, 8, pp. 22-25, (2016); Rigotti N.A., Strategies to help a smoker who is struggling to quit, JAMA., 308, 15, pp. 1573-1580, (2012); Quitting smoking among adults-United States, 2001-2010, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep., 60, 44, pp. 1513-1519, (2011); Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update, 53, 9, pp. 1217-1222, (2008); Sarna L., Bialous S.A., Zou X.N., Et al., Evaluation of a web-based educational programme on changes in frequency of nurses' interventions to help smokers quit and reduce second-hand smoke exposure in China, J Adv Nurs., 72, 1, pp. 118-126, (2016); Enhancing Nursing and Midwifery Capacity to Contribute to the Prevention, Treatment and Management of Noncommunicable Diseases.

Design: A descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in a government national referral hospital. Respondents were 109 systematically sampled mothers who delivered in the study hospital. Mothers’ experiences of intrapartum care were assessed using three subscales from the Experience of Psychosocial Care and Communication during Childbirth Questionnaire (effective communication; emotional support; and respect, care and dignity). Simple and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between sociodemographic factors, socioeconomic factors and mothers’ experiences of intrapartum care. Findings: The majority of respondents were aged 20–24 years (45.9%), married (71.6%), had primary school education (48.6%) and were self-employed (45%). The majority reported positive experiences of communication, respect, dignity and emotional support from their midwives. Being an older mother was significantly associated with a positive experience of intrapartum care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 7.32; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.17–45.9). The odds of having a positive intrapartum care experience was significantly lower among women with parity of four or more (AOR 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01–0.56) and tertiary education (AOR 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01–0.91).

Nursing recruitment remains challenging when compared to other healthcare programs. Despite healthcare students having similar motivation in joining the healthcare industry, many did not consider nursing as a career choice. This study aims to identify the deterrents to choosing nursing among healthcare undergraduates by examining the differences in the factors influencing healthcare career choices and nursing as a career choice. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted using a 35-parallel items instrument known as Healthcare Career Choice and Nursing Career Choice scale. Six hundred and four (n = 604) first year medical, pharmacy, dentistry and social science students from a university in Singapore completed the survey. Results: Nursing as a career was perceived by healthcare students to be more likely influenced by prior healthcare exposure, the nature of the work, job prospects, and social influences. Lack of autonomous decision making, perceived lower ability to make diagnosis, having to attend to patients' hygiene needs, engendered stigma, and lack of parental support were identified as deterring factors to choosing nursing as a career. Conclusion: An understanding of the deterrents to choosing nursing as career allows policy makers and educational leaders to focus on recruitment strategies. These include providing more exposure to nurses' roles in early school years, helping young people to overcome the fear of providing personal hygiene care, promoting nurses' autonomous nursing practice, addressing gender stigma, and overcoming parental objection. © 2018 The Author(s).","Career choices; Healthcare; Nursing recruitment; Perceptions of nursing","Career Choice; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Nursing; Singapore; Social Sciences; Students, Dental; Students, Medical; Students, Pharmacy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult; adult; article; cross-sectional study; decision making; dentistry; diagnosis; fear; female; gender; health student; human; leadership; major clinical study; male; nursing career; nursing practice; perception; personal hygiene; pharmacy; Singapore; sociology; stigma; cross-sectional study; dental student; medical student; nursing; pharmacy student; psychology; questionnaire; university; young adult","","","","","Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social, MISAN, (HSRG11MAY023); Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social, MISAN","Funding text 1: This study was funded by Ministry of Health (MOH) Health Services Research Grant.

The popular online social media (OSM) can be a potential solution to these concerns for their social lives as it allows non-face-to-face social interactions, however it remained unclear how this group is using these online platforms. This study explored their experiences of using online social media, and their perceived benefits and risks associated with this use. Method: Qualitative data was collected through in-depth face to face interviews. We recruited 13 autistic young adults who were with normal intelligence from two community centers in Hong Kong. Interviews were conducted in a semi-structured format by experienced clinical psychologist and social workers. Results: Four themes were identified from the data, namely: (1) Paradox of using OSM to supplement social needs; (2) Unpleasant social interactions in the online environment; (3) Restricted and repetitive pattern of interest leading to troubles in OSM use, and; (4) Privacy and personal safety issues. The results suggested that while OSM could be a useful tool for our participants to connect with existing friends and to meet new ones, their limitations, such as difficulties in understanding languages and social interaction as well as restricted patterns of interests could potentially put them at risk, including interpersonal conflicts, cyber-bullying, financial scams, as well as unwanted sexual experiences. These experiences not only paradoxically increased their sense of loneliness and their distance from others, but also resulted in a negative impact on their mood and functioning. Conclusion: This qualitative study provided some insights into the OSM use among autistic young adults. OSM could be a useful tool to overcome potential limitations in social interactions, but at the same time it could potentially bring detrimental consequences. In order to maximize the benefits of online social networking, there is a need for timely guidance and support to use OSM among autists, and for psychoeducation to promote awareness, and enable adequate skills and behaviors attainment associated with safe OSM use.

This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study examining how lockdown measures impacted upon the lives of nurses, midwives and personal care assistants caring for community-based patients during this time. The study involved nationwide surveys and in-depth interviews with 15 registered nurses employed in community settings, two community midwives and five personal care assistants. During the lockdown, nurses, midwives and personal care assistants working in the community showed considerable courage in answering their ‘call to duty’ by taking on heightened care responsibilities and going ‘the extra mile’ to help others. They faced significant risks to personal and professional relationships when they were required to take on additional and complex responsibilities for community-based patients. Despite the hypervigilant monitoring of their personal protective equipment (PPE), the need to safeguard family and community members generated considerable stress and anxiety. Many also faced personal isolation and loneliness as a result of lockdown restrictions. Moreover, the negative impacts of experiences during lockdown often continued to be felt once restrictions had been lifted, inflecting life during periods in which community transmission of COVID-19 was not occurring. This article makes five core service delivery and policy recommendations for supporting community-based nurses, midwives and personal care assistants in respiratory disease pandemics: acknowledging the crucial role played by community-based carers and the associated stress and anxiety they endured by championing respect and compassion; demystifying the ‘heroism’ or ‘self-sacrifice’ projected onto care workers; the timely provision of adequate protective equipment; improving remuneration, with adequate provision for time off; and regular counselling, peer support groups and education on work-life balance delivered by support workers in recognition of stressors arising from these complex and isolated working conditions. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","community nursing and midwifery; COVID-19 pandemic; fear of contagion; feelings of duty; personal care assistants; work-life balance","Communicable Disease Control; Community Health Services; COVID-19; Humans; New Zealand; Pandemics; communicable disease control; community care; epidemiology; human; New Zealand; pandemic","","","","","","","Appleton N.S., Long N.J., Aikman P.J., Davies S.G., Deckert A., Fehoko E., Holroyd E., Jivraj N., Laws M., Martin-Anatias N., Roguski M., Simpson N., Sterling R., Trnka S., Tunufa'i L., (Alter)narratives of 'winning': Supermarket and healthcare workers' experiences of COVID-19 in Aotearoa New Zealand, Sites, 17, 2, pp. 51-77, (2020); Bagnasco A., Zanini M., Hayter M., Catania G., Sasso L., COVID 19—A message from Italy to the global nursing community, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 76, 9, pp. 2212-2214, (2020); Ballard M., Bancroft E., Nesbit J., Johnson A., Holeman I., Foth J., Rogers D., Yang J., Nardella J., Olsen H., Raghavan M., Panjabi R., Alban R., Malaba S., Christiansen M., Rapp S., Schechter J., Aylward P., Rogers A., Palazuelos D., Prioritising the role of community health workers in the COVID-19 response, BMJ Global Health, 5, (2020); Blanco-Donoso L.M., Moreno-Jimenez J., Gallego-Alberto L., Amutio A., Moreno-Jimenez B., Garrosa E., Satisfied as professionals, but also exhausted and worried!!: The role of job demands, resources and emotional experiences of Spanish nursing home workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, Health & Social Care in the Community, 30, 1, pp. e148-e160, (2021); Bowers B., Pollock K., Oldman C., Barclay S., End-of-life care during COVID-19: Opportunities and challenges for community nursing, British Journal of Community Nursing, 26, 1, pp. 44-46, (2021); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Braun V., Clarke V., Reflecting on reflexive thematic analysis, Qualitative Research in Sport, Exercise and Health, 11, 4, pp. 589-597, (2019); Brazeau C., Schroeder R., Rovi S., Boyd L., Relationships between medical student burnout, empathy, and professionalism climate, Academic Medicine, 85, 10, pp. S33-S36, (2010); Brinkman A., Coping with the COVID-19 virus, Kai Tiaki: Nursing New Zealand, 26, 3, (2020); Brooks S.K., Dunn R., Amlot R., Rubin G.J., Greenberg N., A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease outbreak, Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 60, 3, pp. 248-257, (2018); Corcoran L., Delivering wound care during the pandemic, British Journal of Community Nursing, 26, S6, pp. S34-S37, (2021); Cousins S., New Zealand eliminates COVID-19, The Lancet, 395, 10235, (2020); Crowther S., Maude R., Bradford B., Austin D., Gilkison A., McAra-Couper J., Krisjanous J., When maintaining relationships and social connectivity matter: The case of New Zealand midwives and COVID-19, Frontiers in Sociology, 6, (2021); De Kock J.H., Latham H.A., Leslie S.J., Grindle M., Munoz S.-A., Ellis L., Polson R., O'Malley C.M., A rapid review of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers: Implications for supporting psychological well-being, BMC Public Health, 21, (2021); De los Santos J.A.A., Labrague L.J., The impact of fear of COVID-19 on job stress, and turnover intentions of frontline nurses in the community: A cross-sectional study in the Philippines, Traumatology, 27, 1, pp. 52-59, (2021); Einboden R., SuperNurse?

This study examines the cultural practice of ""doing the month"" by Chinese mothers for two generations of matrilineal datasets. Ethnographic interviews were undertaken with new mothers and their mother and/or mother-in-law. Then, the coded data were compared within matrilineal dyads, as well as within age cohorts. The new mothers highlighted a range of attitudinal and behavioral practices that was informed and enforced by the female family members. They found highly individualized ways of negotiating traditional practices. In contrast, their mothers and mothers-in-law testified to a custom-bound approach. Support from family members appeared to be instrumental and was underscored by traditional notions of filial duty in the older generation of mothers. In comparison, their daughters and daughters-in-law indicated more autonomously directed behaviors. Recommendations are made in order to provide healthcare professionals with a more-informed understanding of Chinese postnatal belief systems. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd..","""doing the month""; Chinese women; Culture; Ethnography; Postnatal practices; Qualitative","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Anthropology, Cultural; China; Cultural Characteristics; Culture; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hong Kong; Humans; Intergenerational Relations; Interview, Psychological; Middle Aged; Mother-Child Relations; Negotiating; Postnatal Care; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; age; article; attitude to health; China; comparative study; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; female; Hong Kong; human; human relation; interpersonal communication; methodology; middle aged; mother child relation; postnatal care; pregnancy; psychologic test; psychological aspect; qualitative research; reproducibility; time","","","","","","","Barclay L., Misery of motherhood: illness or isolation, Communique, 6, pp. 10-13, (1995); Brislin R.W., Cross-cultural research in psychology, Annu.

Background: The Philippines is a major source country of foreign-trained nurses located globally. However, there is paucity of research on professional factors and career related issues affecting foreign-trained nurses’ work experiences. Methods: An integrative review through a comprehensive search of literature was undertaken from November 2015 and was repeated in August 2016. Seven articles satisfied the selection criteria. Results: Filipino nurses experienced differences in the practice of nursing in terms of work process, roles and autonomy. Moreover, they encountered challenges such as work-related discrimination and technical difficulties within the organisation. Conclusion: A clear understanding of Filipino nurses’ work experiences and the challenges they have encountered suggests identification of important constructs influencing effective translation of nursing practice across cultures and health systems, which then form the basis for support strategies. Implication for Nursing Management: It is critical to recognize foreign-trained nurses’ experience of work-related differences and challenges as these foster favorable conditions for the management team to plan and continually evaluate policies around recruitment, retention and support offered to these nurses. Furthermore, findings suggest internationalization of nursing framework and standards integrating a transcultural paradigm among staff members within a work organisation. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","filipino nurses; global nurse migration; integrative review; work experiences","Humans; Nurses, International; Philippines; Work; article; career; human; nursing management; nursing practice; Philippines; work experience; foreign nurse; psychology; work","","","","","","","Aiken L.H., Buchan J., Sochalski J., Nichols B., Powell M., Trends in international nurse migration, Health Affairs, 23, 3, pp. 69-77, (2004); Alexis O., Vydelingum V., The lived experience of overseas black and minority ethnic nurses in the NHS in the south of England, Diversity in Health & Social Care, 1, 1, pp. 13-20, (2004); Ball R.E., Divergent development, racialised rights: Globalised labour markets and the trade of nurses – the case of the Philippines, Women's Studies International Forum, 27, pp. 119-133, (2004); Brown D.E., James G.D., Physiological stress responses in Filipino-American immigrant nurses: The effects of residence time, life-style, and job strain, Psychosomatic Medicine, 62, 3, pp. 394-400, (2000); Brush B.L., Global nurse migration today, Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 40, 1, pp. 20-25, (2008); Brush B.L., Berger A.M., Sending for nurses: Foreign nurse migration, 1965–2002, Nursing and Health Policy Review, 1, 2, pp. 103-116, (2002); Brush B.L., Sochalski J., International nurse migration: Lessons from the Philippines, Policy Politics and Nursing Practice, 8, 1, pp. 37-46, (2007); Connor J.B., Miller A.M., Occupational stress and adaptation of immigrant nurses from the Philippines, Journal of Research in Nursing, 19, pp. 504-515, (2014); Daniel P., Chamberlain A., Gordon F., Expectations and experiences of newly recruited Filipino nurses, British Journal of Nursing, 10, 4, pp. 254-265, (2001); Dywili S., Bonner A., O'Brien L., Why do nurses migrate? – A review of recent literature, Journal of Nursing Management, 21, 3, pp. 511-520, (2013); Ea E.E., Griffin M.Q., L'Eplattenier N., Fitzpatrick J.J., Job satisfaction and acculturation among Filipino registered nurses, Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 40, 1, pp. 46-51, (2008); Hayne A.N., Gerhardt C., Davis J., Filipino nurses in the United States: Recruitment, retention, occupational stress, and job satisfaction, Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 20, 3, pp. 313-322, (2009); Hutchinson M., Vickers M.H., Wilkes L., Jackson D., A typology of bullying behaviours: The experiences of Australian nurses, Journal of Clinical Nursing, 19, 15–16, pp. 2319-2328, (2010); Kawi J., Xu Y., Facilitators and barriers to adjustment of international nurses: An integrative review, International Nursing Review, 56, 2, pp. 174-183, (2009); Kline D.S., Push and pull factors in international nurse migration, Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 35, 2, pp. 107-111, (2003); Lin L.C., A synthesis of the literature on Asian nurses’ work experiences in the United States, Research and Theory for Nursing Practice, 23, 3, pp. 230-245, (2009); McGonagle C., Halloran S.O., O'Reilly O., The expectations and experiences of Filipino nurses working in an intellectual disability service in the Republic of Ireland, Journal of Learning Disabilities, 8, 4, pp. 371-381, (2004); Moher D., Liberati A., Tetzlaff J., Altman D.G., Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: The PRISMA statement, PLoS Medicine, 6, 6, (2009); Pluye P., Robert E., Cargo M., Bartlett G., O'Cathain A., Griffiths F., Rousseau M.C., Proposal: A mixed methods appraisal tool for systematic mixed studies reviews, (2011); Ronquillo C., Boschma G., Wong S.T., Quiney L., Beyond greener pastures: Exploring contexts surrounding Filipino nurse migration in Canada through oral history, Nursing Inquiry, 18, 3, pp. 262-275, (2011); Vestal V., Kautz D.D., Responding to similarities and differences between Filipino and American nurses, Journal of Nursing Administration, 39, 1, pp. 8-10, (2009); Villarruel A., Washington D., Lecher W.T., Carver N.A., A more diverse nursing workforce, American Journal of Nursing, 115, 5, pp. 57-62, (2015); Wagner L.M., Brush B.L., Castle N.G., Eaton M., Capezuti E., Examining differences in nurses’ language, accent, and comprehensibility in nursing home settings based on birth origin and country of education, Geriatric Nursing, 36, 1, pp. 47-51, (2015); Whittemore R., Knafl K., The integrative review: Update methodology, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 52, 5, pp. 546-553, (2005); Winkelmann-Gleed A., Seeley J., Strangers in a British world?

Method: A retrospective ethnographic research design was used. A snowballing sampling method was used to recruit fifteen participants. Face-to-face unstructured audio-taped interviews and field notes were utilised to gather data. Findings: Results showed that rural Swazi women held a dual health belief system of modern and traditional medicinal use; practiced lengthy periods of postpartum confinement; customarily gave regular enemas and traditional medicines to their babies; undertook the specific cultural practice of taking the baby to enyonini [a tree struck by lightening] to perform specific rituals; used self-prescribed pharmacy medicines; used both traditional and modern contraception; as well as practiced breastfeeding. Conclusion: Rural Swazi women observe modern health practices alongside traditional customary practices that are inherent to their health belief and value systems in the postnatal period. These customary beliefs and values underpin their birth practices postpartum. Recommendations include the need to consider including formal knowledge on cultural aspects of childbirth and postpartum care into midwifery education; a review of maternal care practices and policies to incorporate widely practised traditional elements including redressing the use of self-prescribed pharmacy medicines to ensure a higher level of safety. © 2011 Australian College of Midwives.","Cultural practices; Health beliefs; Postnatal care; Swaziland; Values","Adult; Anthropology, Cultural; Breast Feeding; Cultural Characteristics; Culture; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Maternal Health Services; Medicine, Traditional; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Rural Population; Tape Recording; adult; article; breast feeding; contraception; cultural anthropology; ethnography; female; health belief; health care practice; human; maternal care; New Zealand; normal human; perinatal period; postnatal care; pregnancy; priority journal; retrospective study; ritual; rural area; safety; traditional medicine; unstructured interview","","","","","","","(2008); Thwala S.B.P., Jones L.K., Holroyd E., Swaziland rural maternal care: ethnography of the interface of biomedicine and culture, International Journal of Nursing Practice, 17, pp. 93-101, (2011); Bharj K.K., Cooper M.A., The social context of childbirth and motherhood, Myles' textbook for midwives, pp. 21-36, (2009); Rice P.L., Asian mothers Australian birth, (1994); Pairman S., McAra-Couper J., Theoretical frameworks for midwifery practice, Midwifery preparation for practice, pp. 237-257, (2006); Harvey T.A., Buckley L., Childbirth in China, Childbirth across cultures, pp. 55-69, (2009); Engen-Ustiin Y., Ustun Y., Cetin F., Meydanh M.M., Kafkash A., Sezgin B., Effect of postpartum counselling on postpartum contraceptive use, Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 257, pp. 429-432, (2007); Grewal S.K., Bhagat R., Balneaves L.G., Perinatal beliefs and practices of immigrant Punjabi women living in Canada, Journal of Obstetric Gynaecologic and Neonatal Nursing, 3, 37, pp. 290-300, (2008); Chambers C., Celebrating diversity: meeting needs, Midwifery and public health, pp. 83-98, (2005); Foureur M., Next steps: public health in midwifery practice, Midwifery in public health, pp. 221-237, (2005); Iziqbara C.O., Ukwayi J.K., The clientele of traditional home births in rural South-eastern Nigeria, Health Care for Women International, 24, 3, pp. 177-192, (2003); Manderson L., Pregnancy and birth in intercultural settings, Asian mothers, Australian birth, pp. 3-14, (1994); Rice P.L., Nyo dua hli-30 day confinement: traditions and changed childbearing beliefs and practices among Hmong women in Australia, Midwifery, 16, 1, pp. 22-34, (2000); Teng L.E., Blackmore E.R., Stewart D.E., Healthcare worker's perceptions of barriers to care by immigrant women with postpartum depression: an exploratory qualitative study, Women's Mental Health, 10, pp. 93-101, (2007); Munhall P., Nursing research: a qualitative perspective, (2007); Speziale H.J.S., Carpenter D.R., Qualitative research in nursing: advancing the humanistic imperative, (2007); Denzin N., Lincoln Y., The Sage handbook of qualitative research, (2005); Murchison J., Ethnography essentials designing, conducting and presenting your research, (2010); Holloway I., Wheeler S., Qualitative research in nursing, (2002); Chien L., Tai C., Ko Y., Huang C., Sheu S., Adherence to "" doing-the month"" practices is associated with fewer physical and depressive symptoms among post partum women in Taiwan, Research in Nursing and Health, 29, 5, pp. 374-383, (2006); Abrams A.C., Clinical drug therapy, (2004); Lawrence T.A., (2011); Bland R.M., Rollins N.C., Van den Broeck J., Coovadia H.M., The use of non-prescribed medication in the first three month s of life in rural South Africa, Tropical Medicine and International Health, 9, 1, pp. 118-124, (2004); Huang Y., Matters N., Postnatal depression - biological or cultural?

Methods We employed an ethnographic approach utilizing a socio-ecological framework to conduct repeated in-depth interviews with thirty one newly diagnosed HIV positive MSM as well as participant observations in Shenzhen based healthcare settings, MSM venues and NGO offices. Results Some men (6/31) reported continuing to practice UAI after an initial diagnosis of being HIV positive. For MSM who had existing lovers or stable partners, the fear of losing partners in a context of non-serostatus disclosure was testified to be a major concern. MSM with casual partners reported that anonymous sexual encounters and moral judgments played a significant role in their sexual risk behaviors. Simultaneously, self-reported negative emotional and psychological status, perception and idiosyncratic risk interpretation, as well as substance abuse informed the intrapersonal context for UAI. Conclusion UAI among these HIV positive MSM was embedded in an intrapersonal context, related to partner type, shaped by anonymous sexual encounters, psychological status, and moral judgments. It is important that prevention and intervention for secondary HIV transmission among newly diagnosed HIV positive MSM in China take into account these contextual factors. © 2015 Li et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","","Adult;

Methods: Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 Arab women attending a public hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, following a recent diagnosis of breast cancer. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the thematic method. Results: Arab women's experiences following their breast cancer diagnoses and treatments included the themes of (1) protecting one's self from stigma, (2) facing uncertainties and prayers, and (3) getting on with life. Overall, the ways to find solace were through isolation and prayer, which are heavily influenced by religion and spiritual practices. They recommended that to help women with breast cancer, a campaign to raise awareness for early screening is needed as well the need to form a peer-led support group for women with breast cancer consisting of breast cancer survivors so that they can learn from each other's experiences. Conclusions: Arab women with breast cancer experienced a myriad of social, cultural, psychological, and relationship difficulties that impacted their overall health and well-being. The findings also found that these women were not passive agents. They sought to solve problem, move forward, and recreate the meanings in their lives in their own unique ways. Action is needed for possible ways to implement religion-health partnerships between breast cancer nurses, peer-led support groups, palliative care services, and religious institutions.

However, utilisation of these services remains limited among people living with HIV. We explored barriers to accessing HIV/AIDS-related services from the perspective of newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men. We conducted repeated in-depth interviews with 31 newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men, using the socio-ecological framework and thematic content analysis. Multiple barriers for utilisation of HIV/AIDS-related services were identified, including perceptions of subjective health and poor quality of services, mental and emotional health problems, lack of trust and understanding of the services on offer, low economic status, lack of insurance, and high medical fees, being refused access to services, and restrictive attendance policies. The findings provide information on potential multi-level obstacles preventing newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men to use services that they need. It is recommended that policy makers should create a trustful and non-discriminating environment and services integrating physical and mental healthcare. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","barriers to access; China; HIV/AIDS; men who have sex with men; MSM; newly diagnosed; qualitative; service utilisation; stigma","Adolescent; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; China; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services; Health Services Accessibility; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Prejudice; Professional-Patient Relations; Qualitative Research; Social Support; Young Adult; adult; article; China; clinical article; content analysis; diagnosis; emotional stability; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; insurance; interview; male; medical fee; men who have sex with men; nonhuman; perception; qualitative analysis; stigma; trust; adolescent; attitude to health; China; ethnology; health care delivery; health personnel attitude; health service; HIV Infections; human relation; information processing; male homosexuality; prejudice; psychology; qualitative research; social support; utilization; young adult","","","","","Center for Health Behaviors Research of the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care; China National Offshore Oil Corporation, CNOOC; Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research obtained funding from the Center for Health Behaviors Research of the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care (JCSPHPC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), a post-graduate study grant in JCSPHPC, and the Global Scholarship Programme for Research Excellence - CNOOC Grants 2010–11 in CUHK.","Cooper V., Buick D., Horne R., Et al., Perceptions of HAART among gay men who declined a treatment offer: preliminary results from an interview-based study, AIDS Care, 14, pp. 319-328, (2002); Crepaz N., Lyles C.M., Wolitski R.J., Et al., Do prevention interventions reduce HIV risk behaviors among people living with HIV?

We draw on our own experiences of participating in a team of 17 researchers, hailing from anthropology and anthropology-adjacent disciplines, to research social life in Aotearoa/New Zealand during the pandemic, examining how our own research imaginations were transformed during, and via, the process of our collaboration. When our project first began, many of us had doubts reflective of norms, prejudices and anxieties that are common in our disciplines: that the group would be too large to function effectively, or that it would be impossible to develop an approach to authorship that would allow everyone to feel their contributions had been adequately recognised. In practice, the large group size was a key strength in allowing our group to work effectively. Difficulties with authorship did not arise from within the group but from disconnects between our preferred ways of working and the ways authorship was imagined within various professional and publishing bodies. We conclude that large-scale collaborations have many points in their favour, and that the research imaginations of funders, journals, universities and professional associations should be broadened to ensure that they are encouraged, supported and adequately rewarded. © 2023 The Author(s).

Using action research cycles, interviews with five dyads of healthcare recipients (Thai-Muslim older adults and their family primary caregivers) and with seven Thai-Muslim healthcare professionals (five clinical nurses, a physician and a pharmacist) were undertaken alongside participant observations. Inadequate knowledge, insufficient skills, low family involvement, poor negotiation skills, and the need for better integration of Islamic doctrines were identified. Satisfaction was expressed with the program components and activities, with a qualitative audit data revealed that family primary caregivers felt that they had gained more self-confidence, increased their caregiving knowledge and improved their skills. All stakeholders expressed a desire to further engage and maintain this collaborative program. Engaging with Islamic doctrines and concepts of family collaboration support improvements in homebound care for Muslim older adults. Using on core values of Islamic moral belief systems provides an important and culturally sensitized framework for engaging healthcare providers and family members in the Muslim older adults’ comprehensive homebound care. © The Author(s) 2022.","action research; family collaboration; homebound care; islamic doctrine; older adults; Thai-Muslim","Aged; Caregivers; Delivery of Health Care; Family; Humans; Islam; Southeast Asian People; Thailand; aged; article; care behavior; caregiver; clinical article; controlled study; female; health care personnel; human; interview; male; morality; Muslim; negotiation; nurse; pharmacist; physician; satisfaction; skill; family; health care delivery; Islam; Thailand","","","","","Prince of Songkla University, PSU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Prince of Songkla University, (grant number graduate school/2016).

Tongan people have high rates of mental illness and tend to not use mental health services. The risk for mental illnesses also differs between those born in Tonga and those born in NZ. Aim: This study presented the views of New Zealand-dwelling Tongan youth and mental health service users regarding the meaning of mental distress. Methods: A Tongan cultural framework “talanoa” was used to inform the approach to the research. The youth talanoa group had seven participants and the service users talanoa group had twelve participants. Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: Tongan youth and service users constructed mental distress from biopsychosocial perspectives and challenged traditional Tongan perspectives around being possessed by spirits, cursed and disruptions to social and spiritual relationships. Conclusions: The youth and service users construct mental distress from a biopsychosocial angle and there is a need for further information about Tongan perspectives of mental distress. This suggests that a biopsychosocial perspective is needed to ensure engagement by Tongan youth and service users in promoting mental health and alleviating distress. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural beliefs; distress; mental health; service users; Tongan; youth","Adolescent; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; New Zealand; Tonga; alcohol; cannabis; drug; anxiety; Article; biopsychosocial model; depression; distress syndrome; human; information processing; juvenile; medical terminology; mental disease; mental health service; mental stress; obsessive compulsive disorder; patient worry; physical disease; social belief; spirit possession; thematic analysis; Tongan; adolescent; mental disease; mental health; New Zealand; Tonga","","alcohol, 64-17-5; cannabis, 8001-45-4, 8063-14-7","","","Health Research Council of New Zealand, HRC","This study was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand.","Ataera-Minster J., Trowland H., Te Kaveinga: Mental health and wellbeing of Pacific peoples.

This study evaluated a culturally-sensitive and target-orientated sex education programme involving this group. Early school leavers were recruited from two branches of the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association in Hong Kong. These potential peer educators (PEs) attended five three hour workshops providing comprehensive sex and sexuality education. They then provided peers with sex education, whilst receiving continuing support and attending additional training and activities. The Safer Choice Student Health Questionnaire, Math tech Student Course Evaluation and Student Assessment of Course Impact questionnaires and Behavioral Intent Questionnaire were used to assess attitudes towards the programme and changes in knowledge, attitudes, practices regarding sex and sexual health. Of 60 PEs, 97% completed the workshop course. Seven months post intervention, changes in attitude towards contraception (p =0.01) and a lower likelihood of having sex (p< 0.001) were found amongst PEs. At 14 months, PEs were less likely to have sex (p< 0.001) and were more comfortable talking about sex with friends and family (p=0.01) but no difference was observed in pre-training and post training tests among 545 targeted peers. The intervention successfully engaged the heavily involved PEs, and had some positive effects on their willingness to discuss sexual health issues, their perceived likelihood of having and their attitude towards sexual intercourse. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","Abreu J.M., Newcomb M.D., Promoting healthy lifestyles among adolescents, Counselling Across the Lifespan: Prevention and Treatment, pp. 93-133, (2002); Audrey S., Holliday J., Campbell R., It's good to talk: Adolescent perspectives of an informal, peer-led intervention to reduce smoking, Social Science and Medicine, 63, pp. 320-334, (2006); Balint M., The Doctor, His Patient and The Illness, (1986); Basen-Engquist K., Masse L.C., Coyle K., Kirby D., Parcel G.S., Banspach S., Nodora J., Validity of scales measuring the psychosocial determinants of HIV/STD-related risk behaviour in adolescents, Health Education Research, 14, pp. 25-38, (1999); Basen-Engquist K., Coyle K., Parcel G.S., Kirby D., Stephen W., Banspach S., Carvajal S., Baumler E., Schoolwide effects of a multicomponent HIV, STD and pregnancy prevention programme for high school students, Health Education and Behaviour, 28, pp. 166-185, (2001); Berkeley D., Ross D., Strategies for improving the sexual health of young people, Culture, Health and Sexuality, 5, pp. 71-96, (2003); Brabin L., Sexually Transmitted Infections: Issues In Adolescent Health and Development, (2002); Buston K., Wight D., Hart G., Scott S., Implementation of a teacher-delivered sex education programmeme: Obstacles and facilitating factors, Health Education Research, 17, pp. 59-72, (2002); Cai Y., Hong H., Shi R., Ye X., Xu G., Li S., Shen L., Long-term follow-up study on peerled school-based HIV/AIDS prevention among youths in Shanghai, International Journal of STD and AIDS, 19, pp. 848-850, (2008); Castilla J., Barrio G., Jose B.M., de Fuente I., Drug and alcohol consumption and sexual risk behaviour among young adults: Results from a national survey, Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 56, pp. 47-54, (1998); 2006 Population By-census, (2007); Cheng S.Y., Lo K.K., Sexually transmitted infections in adolescents, Hong Kong Journal of Paediatrics, 7, pp. 76-84, (2002); Craig P., Dieppe P., Macintyre S., Michie S., Nazareth I., Petticrew M., Developing and evaluating complex interventions: The new Medical Research Council guidance, BMJ, 337, pp. 979-983, (2008); Crosby R.A., Diclemente R.J., Wingood G.M., Salazar L.F., Rose E., Sales J.M., The protective value of school enrolment against sexually transmitted disease: A study of high-risk African American adolescent females, Sexually Transmitted Infections, 83, pp. 223-227, (2007); Edgardh K., Sexual behaviour and early coitarche in a national sample of 17-year-old Swedish boys, Acta Paediatrica, 91, pp. 985-999, (2002); 2006.

Method:: The following study will report the results from phase 1 of a two-phase study examining the Australian nurse's perspective of verbal handover. The data were gathered over a 2-month period in 2013 for phase 1 of the study. Phase 1 of the research was undertaken using Strauss and Corbin's Grounded Theory methodology, to explore the perceptions of verbal handover by acute care nurses. The participants included 41 registered nurses purposively sampled from acute care surgical and medical backgrounds in a metropolitan hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Data were collected using intensive interviewing techniques in six focus groups with an average of seven members in each group. The data were then coded and analyzed concurrently allowing the categorization of core concepts. Results:: Communication proved to be the underlying core concept with linked themes such as mode of handover, relevance of information, professional roles of nursing, duty of care, timeliness and scope of practice. Conclusion:: Communication during handover time must be tailored to support the oncoming nurse in preparing for the shift ahead. To do this effectively, information shared must be relevant and fashioned in such a way that the oncoming nurse can prioritize patient care needs while ensuring adherence to their scope of practice. This Grounded Theory has helped toward the reconceptualization of verbal handover, one that attempts to enhance current end-of-shift communication practices and processes, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes. © 2017 University of Adelaide, Joanna Briggs Institute.","Communication;

The aim of this study was to explore patients’ perceptions of living with gout. A descriptive qualitative study was conducted and 15 adults with gout were interviewed face-to-face between December 2014 and January 2015. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the transcribed data. The experiences of patients with gout were found to revolve around four themes: emotional experiences with gout, disruptions in daily lives, interactions with doctor, and coping with gout using internal and external resources. The in-depth understanding of the patients’ experiences indicates a need to provide holistic patient education and to involve family members to create nurse-led support groups and to raise public awareness regarding gout. © The Author(s) 2018.","descriptive qualitative; experiences; gout; interview; Singapore","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Chronic Disease; Emotions; Family; Gout; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Qualitative Research; Singapore; adult; chronic disease; complication; coping behavior; emotion; family; gout; human; interview; male; middle aged; perception; psychology; qualitative research; Singapore","","","","","Department of Rheumatology","The authors appreciate the participants to share their experiences.

Background: New Zealand is rapidly becoming the host to an increasing number of ageing Filipino immigrants. Despite this sizeable population growth of ageing Filipinos in New Zealand, still very little is known about this ethnic group's care needs and living arrangement preferences in later life within the New Zealand context. Design: Qualitative descriptive approach. Methods: Data were collected from 15 older Filipinos who participated in face-to-face interviews. Data were analysed using a thematic analytical framework. Results: Two major themes were identified from the data analysis. The first theme “preferred living and care arrangements” is about older Filipinos’ preferred plans for future residence and in receiving care when no longer able to function independently in their own homes. The second theme “negotiating readiness and acceptance” is about hypothetical situations that older Filipinos described and anticipated that will greatly facilitate their readiness and acceptance to living in aged care facilities. Conclusion: The study results have implications for service delivery within the New Zealand residential aged care sector. Due to an increasing number of older Filipino immigrants requiring care, residential aged care facilities must ensure their care models meet the needs of this growing group of older people. Relevance to clinical practice: Nursing staff skill sets in the aged care sector require sensitivity to older immigrants’ health needs without compromising cultural beliefs and practices while living in residential aged care facilities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","late-life care arrangement; living arrangements; New Zealand; older Filipinos; older immigrants","Aged; Aging; Culturally Competent Care; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Nursing Homes; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Philippines; Qualitative Research; article; clinical practice; data analysis; health care delivery; human; immigrant; interpersonal communication; interview; New Zealand; New Zealander; nursing staff; skill; aged; aging; ethnology; female; home for the aged; male; middle aged; migrant; New Zealand; nursing home; patient attitude; Philippines; procedures; qualitative research; transcultural care","","","","","","","Angel J.L., Angel R.J., Markides K.S., Late-life immigration, changes in living arrangements, and headship status among older Mexican-origin individuals, Social Science Quarterly, 81, 1, pp. 389-403, (2000); Baker L., Age care ‘isolating’ for ethnic groups, (2014); Bolzman C., Fibbi R., Vial M., What to do after retirement?

The comparison of career choice influences and perception of nursing among healthcare students can provide information for recruitment strategies. An instrument to compare the influences of healthcare career choice is lacking. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of an instrument to compare the influences of healthcare career choice with perceptions of nursing as a career choice. Methods: The study was conducted in two phases. In phase one, two sets of scales with parallel items that measure the influences of healthcare career choice and perceptions of nursing as a career choice were developed through an earlier qualitative study, literature review, and expert validation. Phase two involved testing the construct validity, concurrent validity and reliability with a convenience sample of 283 first year healthcare students who were recruited at two education institutions in Singapore. Results: An exploratory factor analysis revealed 35-parallel items in a six-factor solution (personal interest, prior healthcare exposure, self-efficacy, perceived nature of work, job prospects, and social influences) that explained 59 and 64% of the variance for healthcare career choice and nursing as a career choice respectively. A high correlation (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) was obtained with an existing tool, confirming the concurrent validity. The internal consistency was sufficient with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.93 for healthcare career choice and 0.94 for nursing as a career choice. The test-retest reliability was acceptable with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.63 for healthcare career choice and 0.60 for nursing as a career choice. Conclusions: The instrument provides opportunities for understanding the differences between influences of healthcare career choice and perceptions of nursing as a career choice. This comparative understanding of career choice influences can guide educator and policy-makers on nursing recruitment. © 2017 The Author(s).","Career choice; Healthcare course; Nursing recruitment; Psychometric testing; Scale development","Adolescent; Adult; Career Choice; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Nursing; Prospective Studies; Psychometrics; Singapore; Students, Health Occupations; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; concurrent validity; construct validity; controlled study; convenience sample; correlation coefficient; decision making; doctor patient relation; education; exploratory factor analysis; exposure; health student; human; human experiment; internal consistency; nursing; qualitative research; self concept; Singapore; test retest reliability; validation process; adolescent; adult; attitude to health; female; health student; male; prospective study; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; standards; validation study; young adult","","","","","Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social, MISAN","This study was funded by Ministry of Health (MOH) Health Services Research Grant.

As most cases are asymptomatic, partner notification may be helpful in controlling chlamydia. This study examined attitudes towards partner notification for chlamydia among Hong Kong Chinese youths in order to inform a culturally appropriate, patient-empowering sexual health service. Meth-ods: Sixteen individuals (aged 20 to 31) who received a confirmed diagnosis of chlamydia within the previous twelve months of data collection were recruited from two community-based organizations between June and December 2017. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted by a health psychologist. Results: Nine participants notified a total of eleven current and ex-partners. Seven participants did not notify their sexual partner(s). Our findings revealed how participants struggled with the discrediting sexual aspect of their infection, and how de-sexualizing the infection and selected disclosure facilitated partner notification and social acceptance. Perceived stigma regarding chlamydia however did not dissipate with their disclosure. Participants did not perceive lasting impact of chlamydia on their well-being as they thought they have much control over whether and how to disclose to their (future) partners. All participants agreed there was a pressing need to raise public awareness on this silent but highly prevalent sexually transmitted infection. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate the complex struggle behind communicating about chlamydia to one’s sexual partner and how strategizing the disclosure process served to circumvent embarrassment and foster testing of sexual partners. © 2021 by the authors.

In Singapore, what has been overlooked to date is an in-depth, contextually based examination of the needs, expectations, and barriers faced in self-care management by older adults with Type 2 diabetes. Purpose: This study aimed to explore the experiences of older Singaporeans with Type 2 diabetes in diabetes self-care management to understand their perceived needs, expectations, and barriers associated with their diabetes self-care management. Methods: A descriptive qualitative approach using focus group discussions was adopted. Purposive sampling was used to recruit older adults with Type 2 diabetes from Singapore's three main ethnic groups, namely, Chinese, Malay, and Indian, through the diabetes centers of two hospitals. Four focus groups, including two groups of Chinese, one group of Malays, and one group of Indians, were conducted. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data set for emerging themes that relate to the experiences of participants with diabetes self-care management. Results: The four major themes related to the experiences of participants with diabetes self-care management that emerged were as follows: (a) ""Diabetes is genetic, destined, and not serious; complication, let it come""; (b) ""Diabetes self-care is difficult""; (c) ""I don't know diabetes""; and (d) ""Doctor and nurses are important facilitators of self-care management."" Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Findings have important implications in Singapore as well as in other Asian countries where populations are also aging and diabetes prevalence is increasing. The findings provide new culturally focused insights for clinical patient education within the Southeast Asian context to improve diabetes self-care management of older adults.

This study aimed to evaluate and understand the effectiveness of a resilience-promoting programme in improving psychological health and, ultimately, safe sex practice. Methods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at three Hong Kong-based non-governmental organisations. 127 sex workers were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. The former received a six-session resilience-promoting programme designed to improve self-esteem, self-efficacy and coping skills, whereas the latter had the usual care. Between-group differences in psychological outcomes and condom use were tested using the intention-to-treat, with ANOVA and chi-square tests, measured at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-ups. Multiple mediation analysis was used to examine how the intervention worked through resilience factors. Results: Significant between-group improvements in adaptive coping (F                             1,119                              = 5.82, p <.05) and reduction in psychological distress (F                             1,118                              = 5.00, p <.05) were seen at post-intervention and 3-month follow-ups, with significant time × group interaction changes suggesting the changes occurred at different rates between the two groups. Condom use during the last transactions had increased in the intervention group and the rate of consistent condom use during transactions improved in the intervention group at follow-ups (χ                             2                              = 4.35, p <.05). Self-esteem and resilience significantly mediated the effect of intervention at reducing psychological distress. Conclusions: These findings suggest that resilience improves the psychological health and general wellbeing of Chinese FSWs.                          © 2019 The Authors","China; HIV; Prostitution; Randomised control trial; Resilience","adult; analysis of variance; article; chi square test; China; condom use; controlled study; coping behavior; female; group dynamics; Hong Kong; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; mental stress; nonhuman; organization; prostitution; psychological well-being; randomized controlled trial; self esteem; sex worker","","","","","Council for the AIDS Trust Fund, (MSS204R); General Research Fund; Research Grants Council, (782613); University Grants Committee, UGC; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC","Funding text 1: This research project was funded by the Council for the AIDS Trust Fund (Project number: MSS204R ) and General Research Grant, Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee , HKSAR (Project number: 782613 ).

In recent times provincial governments in China have implemented various institutional incentive measures. However, little is known regarding the effectiveness of such measures. This qualitative study investigated the nature and outcomes of some identified institutionalized mechanisms, in particular how these were created and distributed in the form of incentives for voluntary blood donation. Methods. Participatory observations were conducted at two blood donation stations and four blood collecting vehicles in Changsha city, China. In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 staff and 58 blood donors at the aforementioned venues from May to October 2008 in Changsha. Results: Thematic analysis revealed the operation of four primary type incentives: policy-driven, symbolic, information feedback and role models, which constituted the system of institutional incentives. The current blood reimbursement system was not the primary motivation for blood donation; instead this system was a subtheme of future assurance for emergency blood needs. It was evident that symbolic incentives stressed the meaning and value of blood donation. Furthermore, post-donation information services and the inherent mechanisms of communication, enhanced by some public role models, served to draw the public to donate blood. Conclusions: At the institutional level, blood donation was not only informed by altruism, but also carried a system of benefit and reward for the donors and their family members. We would recommend that such arrangements, if accommodated effectively into China's health promotion strategies, would increase the likelihood of blood donation. © 2013 Yu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Blood collection; Blood donation; China; Institutional incentives","Altruism; Attitude to Health; Blood Banks; Blood Donors; China; Decision Making; Family Relations; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Motivation; Public Health Practice; Qualitative Research; Reimbursement Mechanisms; Urban Population; Voluntary Workers; altruism; article; attitude to health; blood bank; blood donor; China; decision making; family relation; female; health promotion; human; legal aspect; male; methodology; motivation; psychological aspect; public health service; qualitative research; reimbursement; standard; urban population; voluntary worker","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (11WKPY21)","We would like to thank Prof. Jun Jing, Tsinghua University, and Prof. Daming Zhou and Guoqing Ma, Sun Yat-sen University, for their overall generous supports of this research and in critical reviews of this manuscript.

Methods: A qualitative descriptive methodology underpinned this study. In-depth individual interviews were conducted in Mandarin with purposively recruited participants. The twenty-three participants in the study had all emigrated from China, were 65–80 years old on arrival and had lived in New Zealand for between 2.5 and 16 years. An inductive thematic analytic process was undertaken. The COREQ checklist was followed to ensure study rigour. Results: Three themes, ‘high value placed on meeting family obligations’, ‘feeling a deep sense of imbalanced intergenerational reciprocity’ and ‘moving away from filial expectations’, were identified. Confucianist values of ‘women's domestic duty of caring for grandchildren’, ‘filial piety’, and ‘saving face’ to be accepted and respected by others negatively attributed to participants' understandings and experiences of loneliness. To plan for increasing frailty and to avoid family conflict while ameliorating potential loneliness, some participants reluctantly discarded prior customary filial piety expectations in favour of formal aged care options. Conclusions: Participants' profound sense of loneliness was seen to be attributed to their deeply rooted cultural values and backgrounds from having lived for a significant period of time in China. Loneliness occurred as a result of the resettlement process in later life. These experiences highlight the importance of using cultural framing that takes into account beliefs and adaptations to host societies anticipated during the process of late-life immigration. © 2022 The Authors.

Using social determinants of health framework this study sought to identify health practices, problems and needs of African ASRs in Hong Kong. Methods: A cross-sectional survey comprising of six domains including health status, health-seeking behaviour and social experience targeted at adult African ASRs in Hong Kong was conducted through three local non-governmental organisations between February and April 2013. Outpatient care and inpatient care in the past 12 months were used as proxy measures of general and severe ill health respectively. Associations between the determinants of health factors with general or severe health was explored through logistic regressions. Results: Majority of 374 participants were young, single, educated males having been in Hong Kong for over 5 years. A third of ARS (36.1 %) screened positive for depression. Most reported problems related to basic necessities (64.7-78.6 %) and access to health services (72.2 %). ASRs with relatively less education, health awareness or higher risk behaviours were less likely to have obtained outpatient or inpatient services. African ASRs reporting problems with case officers (aOR = 2.80; 95 % CI = 1.35-5.79) or illness in the past 30 days (aOR = 6.00; 95 % CI = 2.94-12.25) were more likely to report general ill health. Similarly, problems with the case officers (aOR = 3.76; 95 % CI = 1.97-7.18) and self-reported illness in the past 30 days (aOR = 3.32; 95 % CI= 1.68-6.57) were also significantly associated with severe ill health. At the health system level, those who reported experiencing difficulties accessing the medical services in Hong Kong are 3.29 (95 % CI = 1.48-7.31) and 4.12 (95 % CI = 1.73-9.79) times as likely to report general and severe ill health respectively. Conclusion: The host government should have moral and ethical obligations to attend to the health needs of ASRs. Evidently a number of structural and health system factors have significantly impacted the health of African ASRs in Hong Kong. Changes to current policies regarding how African ASRs are handled whilst in Hong Kong but, more immediately, improvements in healthcare access are needed. © 2016 The Author(s).","Access to health; Health needs; Hong Kong; Human rights; Refugees","Africa; China; Hong Kong; accessibility; asylum seeker; health services; health status; human rights; migrants experience; nongovernmental organization; public access; refugee; spatiotemporal analysis; adult; African; Article; asylum seeker; awareness; basic needs; controlled study; depression; doctor patient relation; educational status; experience; female; general health status assessment; health awareness; health behavior; health care; health care access; health care organization; health care system; health seeking behavior; health service; health status; high risk behavior; Hong Kong; human; human rights; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical service; middle aged; morality; outpatient care; patient care; priority journal; public health problem; self reported illness; severe ill health; social determinants of health; social discrimination; social experience; social psychology; social status","","","","","AIDs Trust Funds, (MSS 200R)","This work was supported by The AIDs Trust Funds [Grant Number: MSS 200R].","UNHCR Global Trends: Forced Dsiplacement in 2014, (2014); Carvalho R., Hong Kong's refugee claim system leaves many tough questions, South Morning China Post, (2016); Shum T., Refugee Protection and Spaces: Seeking Asylum in Hong Kong, Oxford Monitor of Forced Migration, 1, 2, pp. 17-20, (2011); Loper K., Human rights, non-refoulement and the protection of refugees in Hong Kong, International Journal of Refugee Law, 22, 3, pp. 404-439, (2010); Hong Kong's Zero Recognition Rate: A Mystery in Numbers, (2015); Lee D., Aslyum Seekers 'Forced to Live in Pigeon Farm', (2013); Otero W., Hong Kong Refugees Deserve Basic Rights to Decide What They Eat, (2014); Denial of Asylum Seekers' Rights, (2006); Smith M., Health care for refugees, Asia Pacific Family Medicine, 2, 2, pp. 71-73, (2003); Amara A.H., Aljunid S.M., Noncommunicable diseases among urban refugees and asylum-seekers in developing countries: A neglected health care need, Globalization and Health, 10, 1, (2014); Frequently Asked Questions on Migration and Health, (2015); Klein H., Health inequality, social exclusion and neighbourhood renewal: Can place-based renewal improve the health of disadvantaged communities?, Australian Journal of Primary Health, 10, 3, pp. 110-119, (2004); White M., Cultural Definitions of Health Care: A Case Study of Burmese Refugees in Indianapolis, J Indiana Acad Soc Sci., 15, pp. 140-163, (2012); Duncan G.F., Refugee Healthcare: Towards Healing Relationships, Canadian Social Science, 11, 9, pp. 158-168, (2015); Morris M.D., Et al., Healthcare barriers of refugees post-resettlement, Journal of Community Health, 34, 6, pp. 529-538, (2009); World Health Organization: A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health, (2010); Sternthal M.J., Slopen N., Williams D.R., Racial disparities in health, Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race, 8, 1, pp. 95-113, (2011); Kroenke K., Spitzer R.L., Williams J.B., The Patient Health Questionnaire-2: Validity of a two-item depression screener, Medical Care, 41, 11, pp. 1284-1292, (2003); Jamil H., Et al., Self-rated health and medical conditions in refugees and immigrants from the same country of origin, Iraqi Journal of Medical Sciences, 13, 2, (2015); Wagner J., Et al., Diabetes among refugee populations: What newly arriving refugees can learn from resettled Cambodians, Current Diabetes Reports, 15, 8, pp. 1-14, (2015); Barnett E.D., Infectious disease screening for refugees resettled in the United States, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 39, 6, pp. 833-841, (2004); Idler E.L., BenyaminiY, Self-rated Health and Mortality: A Review of Twenty-seven Community Studies.

Objectives: To identify the factors influencing the career choice of Singaporean healthcare students and determine the deterrents in choosing nursing as a career choice. Design: An exploratory descriptive qualitative study design was used. Participants: Fifty-nine healthcare students from three higher education institutions were recruited. Method: Four nursing and four non-nursing focus groups discussion were held. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Six themes emerged as follows: ‘personal interest’; ‘prior healthcare exposure’; ‘job prospects’; ‘academic performance’; ‘perceived nature of work’; and ‘social influences’. Discussion: The personal interests to help and care along with prior healthcare exposures were found to influence the students’ choice. Job prospects such as the ease of getting a job, job stability, and job salary were considered. Nursing was perceived as a course for students with poor academic ability. Misconceptions about the nature of work and a lack of social recognition were identified as deterring factors in students’ choice of nursing as a career. Conclusions: An understanding of the career decision process among healthcare students enables educational leaders and policy-makers to enhance the focus of nursing recruitment strategies. Implications for nursing and/or health policy: Strategies for nursing recruitment in Singapore must include creating more opportunities for exposure to nursing in early school years, reviewing the admission policies for nursing programmes to attract academically abled students, ensuring that nursing graduates’ salaries are comparable with other healthcare graduates, promoting a better understanding on the role of a registered nurse and its career developments, and providing support for those who are interested in nursing but are faced with career decision-making difficulties due to their families. © 2016 International Council of Nurses","Career Choice; Career Decision; Focus Groups; Nursing; Qualitative Recruitment; Singapore","Career Choice; Delivery of Health Care; Focus Groups; Humans; Nursing; Singapore; Students; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; decision making; DNA transcription; doctor patient relation; education; exploratory research; exposure; family; health care policy; health student; human; interview; leadership; major clinical study; nursing; qualitative research; recognition; registered nurse; salary; Singapore; Singaporean; thematic analysis; health care delivery; information processing; nursing student; questionnaire; Singapore; student","","","","","Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social, MISAN","This study was funded by Ministry of Health (MOH) Health Services Research Grant.

Objective: To understand older Filipino immigrants’ beliefs and values towards filial expectations. Design: Focused ethnography. Results: Two major themes were identified. The first theme ‘moving away from filial expectations’ drew out older Filipino’s changing views of cultural expectations from their adult children. The second theme ‘maintaining cultural values through good family relationships’ highlighted the importance of acknowledging the cultural values considered to be most important by older Filipinos, which was having harmonious relationships and avoiding family conflict. Conclusion: The reconfigured expectation was salient with participants’ who identified ‘not being a burden’ to their adult children and the ardent desire to maintain positive family relationships. Impact Statement: Nurses need to be aware of changes to our current understanding of filial piety when providing care to older Filipinos. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aged care nurses; cultural models; culturally diverse older adults; filial expectations; older immigrants; qualitative","Adult; Adult Children; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anthropology, Cultural; Cultural Characteristics; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Intergenerational Relations; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Parent-Child Relations; Philippines; Social Support; adult; adult child; article; child; cultural value; ethnography; expectation; family conflict; human; immigrant; nurse; aged; child parent relation; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; ethnology; female; human relation; male; middle aged; migrant; New Zealand; Philippines; psychology; social support; very elderly","","","","","","","Agbayani-Siewert P., Revilla L., Filipino Americans, Sage focus editions, Vol. 174.

This study investigated rural Tanzanian women's perceptions and cultural beliefs of the barriers to family planning services utilization. Methods: This study used a qualitative descriptive approach drawing on four group discussions with 20 purposively selected married women with two or more children. The study followed COREQ guidelines for reporting qualitative studies. Data were collected from participants at four health facilities in Bagamoyo and Kisarawe districts in Pwani, Tanzania. Results: Participants’ occupations included housewives, small-scale farmers, and entrepreneurs. Most women were Muslim and had a primary school education. Five main themes were identified: use of modern and traditional family planning methods; my husband will love me more if I give birth to more children; men's expected roles in family planning; provide education to dispel myths; and religious barriers. Associated sub-themes covered use of strings, snares and pigis; calendars; breastfeeding linked to family planning; men as heroes for having many children; men not having time to attend clinic; and conflicting sources of health information. Conclusion: Lack of adequate family planning information; beliefs on and use of traditional/unconventional methods; gender roles expectations that influence decision making and limit women's choices of family planning methods and; socio-cultural and religious beliefs were main perceived barriers for family planning utilization in this study. Mitigation of these barriers depends on the sustained engagement of key stakeholders including religious and community leaders. Health education must be designed to adapt socio-cultural and religious doctrines with benefits of family planning and health outcomes. Health delivery services must also address women's’ prevailing perceptions and beliefs with emphasize on the partner communication and their encouragement of men's’ involvement in reproductive health services utilization. © 2019 The Authors","Beliefs; Contraception; Family planning utilization; Low resource settings; Perceptions; Women","agricultural worker; article; breast feeding; child; clinical article; contraception; controlled study; decision making; drawing; expectation; family planning; female; health care utilization; health education; housewife; human; human experiment; husband; leadership; male; married woman; medical information; Muslim; occupation; perception; practice guideline; primary school; qualitative research; religion; reproductive health; sex role; Tanzania; Tanzanian","","","","","University Research Council, Aga Khan University, URC","This study received financial support from the Aga Khan University Research Grant Council.

Building and strengthening health systems is one way to secure better outcomes. However, the discourse to date has predominately focussed on inequities in health outcomes for Māori. This study has interest in the African ethnic minority community in New Zealand. It undertakes a narrative review of the New Zealand health system which aims to identify literature around the attainment of health equity of African minority by: (i) providing a critical overview of the healthcare delivery system using World Health Organization's six inter-related building blocks of health system strengthening; (ii) developing a summary and discussions of the research results and; (iii) identifying priorities and recommendations for future research. Method: A narrative review of 27 articles published between January 2010 and June 2019 were selected from CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar. Grey literature also informed the review. Articles excluded studies: (i) non-related to New Zealand; (ii) with no focus on equity on ethnic minority in the delivering of healthcare; (iii) had no full text available. Findings: Literature on Africans health outcomes were scarce regarding the six building blocks. However, findings show inequities in accessibility of health services, a non-ethnic inclusive health workforce, a leadership and governance which lack political will on migrant health and resultantly an under-performing health information system which influences resource allocation. Recommendation and conclusion: An improvement and well-functioning health information system is pivotal to capture the unmet needs of the African population. There is a need for research and political will to invest in African minority health and diverse workforce that understands the background of the African population; and action to address structural and institutional racism and white privilege to address root causes of inadequate access and care processes for ethnic minorities. © 2020 The Author(s).","Africans; Ethnic minority; Health delivery systems; Health equity; Health system strengthening; New Zealand","Continental Population Groups; Cultural Diversity; Delivery of Health Care; Ethnic Groups; Government Programs; Health Equity; Health Workforce; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Leadership; Medical Assistance; Minority Groups; New Zealand; Racism; Resource Allocation; Vulnerable Populations; Africa; New Zealand; Scopus; equity; ethnic minority; public health; racism; African; Cinahl; ethnic group; grey literature; health care delivery; health care system; health equity; health workforce; human; leadership; medical information system; Medline; mental capacity; migrant; minority health; narrative; New Zealand; racism; resource allocation; review; Scopus; structure activity relation; World Health Organization; ancestry group; cultural diversity; government; health care delivery; health care disparity; medical care; minority group; New Zealand; vulnerable population","","","","","","","Beaman A., Asano R., Sibbritt D., Newton P.J., Davidson P.M., Global service learning and health systems strengthening: An integrative literature review, Heliyon., 4, 8, (2018); Puchner K., Karamagioli E., Pikouli A., Tsiamis C., Kalogeropoulos A., Kakalou E., Et al., Time to rethink refugee and migrant health in Europe: Moving from emergency response to integrated and individualized health care provision for migrants and refugees, J Environ Res Public Health., 15, 6, (2018); Bundesbank D., G20 Leaders Declaration Shaping an interconnected world, Hamburg, 15, (2017); Swanson R.C., Et al., Strengthening health systems in low-income countries by enhancing organizational capacities and improving institutions, Glob Health., 11, 1, (2015); Huddleston T., Bilgili O., Joki A., Vankova Z., Migrant Integration Policy Index, (2015); Matheson D., Loring B., Health inequities are rising unseen in New Zealand, The New Zealand Medical Journal, 124, 1333, (2011); Sheridan N.F., Kenealy T.W., Connolly M.J., Mahony F., Barber P.A., Boyd M.A., Et al., Health equity in the New Zealand health care system: A national survey, J Equity Health., 10, 1, (2011); Becares L., Cormack D., Harris R., Ethnic density and area deprivation: Neighbourhood effects on maori health and racial discrimination in aotearoa/New Zealand, Soc Sci Med., 88, pp. 76-82, (2013); Harris R.B., Cormack D.M., Stanley J., The relationship between socially-assigned ethnicity, health and experience of racial discrimination for Maori: Analysis of the 2006/07 New Zealand health survey, BMC Public Health., 13, 1, (2013); Came H., McCreanor T., Manson L., Nuku K., Upholding Te Tiriti, ending institutional racism and crown inaction on health equity, N Z Med J., 132, 1492, (2019); Scragg R., Asian health in aotearoa in 2006-2007: Trend since 2002-2003, Auckland: Auckland Northern District Health Board Support Agency, (2010); Durie M., The treaty of Waitangi and health care, N Z Med J., 102, 869, pp. 283-285, (1989); Bedford R., Hugo G., Population Movement in the Pacific: A Perspective on Future Prospects.

Literature on immigrant health in New Zealand (NZ) remains scant. This integrative literature review was conducted drawing on peerreviewed research articles on immigrant health in NZ published between 2012 and 2018. The objectives were to: (i) provide a critical overview of immigrant health in NZ; (ii) identify general trends in health research conducted in NZ on immigrants; (iii) compare, contrast, and evaluate the quality of the information; (iv) develop a summary of research results and; (v) identify priorities and recommendations for future research. A search yielded more than 130 articles with 28 articles constituting the foundation of the review. This review is timely following the rapid increase in the scale, speed, and spread of immigration and its potential for changing NZ's national health patterns and priorities. This integrative review led to the four primary conclusions. Firstly, migration in NZ is a gendered phenomenon, as there has been more women and girls arriving as migrants in NZ and being at risk of poor health in comparison with their male counterparts. Secondly, studies on infectious diseases take precedence over other health problems. Thirdly, research methodologies used to collect data may not be relevant to the cultural and traditional customs of the migrant populations. Furthermore, a number of research findings implemented have failed to meet the needs of NZ migrants. Lastly, policy initiatives are inclined more towards supporting health practitioners and lack a migrant centred approach. What is already known about this topic? Despite NZ becoming more ethnically and linguistically diverse, there is limited literature on the health of migrants living in NZ. What this paper adds? This integrative literature review provides a critical overview of refugee and migrant health in NZ through reviewing and critiquing the current literature available. This paper identifies research trends, the general health of migrants in NZ, recommendations that could inform future migrant and refugee health research and health policies and initiatives to ensure effective and relevant health service provision to migrants. © 2018 Kanengoni et al.","Health policy; Healthcare; Immigrant; Migrant, Health; New Zealand; Refugee","Article; global health; health care; health practitioner; health service; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; human trafficking; immigrant; infection; knowledge; mental health; nonhuman; population and population related phenomena; prevalence; public health; thematic analysis; tuberculosis","","","","","Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT; Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Auckland University of Technology Vice Chancellor Doctoral Scholarship.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an accelerated increase in the use of telehealth services, especially technological solutions targeting women’s health. Understanding the factors behind midlife women’s help-seeking behaviors amidst the pandemic will assist in the development of person-centered holistic telehealth solutions targeting menopausal and postreproductive health. Objective: This study aimed to compare the factors underlying help-seeking for menopausal distress among midlife women in the United States and China. Methods: We conducted 2 web-based panel surveys in the United States using Amazon Mechanical Turk and in China using Credamo between July and October 2022. A total of 1002 American and 860 Chinese women aged between 40 and 65 years took part in the survey. The survey was designed based on the Health Belief Model with questions related to their menopausal knowledge, perceived severity of menopausal symptoms, perceived susceptibility to menopausal distress, perceived benefits of help-seeking, perceived COVID-19– and non–COVID-19–related barriers against help-seeking, self-efficacy, and motivation to seek help. Structural equations models were fitted for the data using full information maximum likelihood to manage missing data. Results: Knowledge was not directly related to help-seeking motivation in both samples. Among the Chinese sample, knowledge was negatively related to perceived severity but positively related to COVID-19–related barriers; in turn, higher perceived severity, benefits, COVID-19–related barriers, and self-efficacy and lower non–COVID-19–related barriers were related to more motivation to seek help. In the US sample, knowledge was negatively related to perceived severity, susceptibility, benefits, barriers (COVID-19–and non–COVID-19–related), and self-efficacy; in turn, higher self-efficacy, COVID-19–related barriers, and benefits were associated with more help-seeking motivation. The factors explained 53% and 45.3% of the variance of help-seeking motivation among the American and Chinese participants, respectively. Conclusions: This study revealed disparate pathways between knowledge, health beliefs, and the motivation for help-seeking among American and Chinese midlife women with respect to menopausal distress. Our findings show that knowledge may not directly influence help-seeking motivation. Instead, perceived benefits and self-efficacy consistently predicted help-seeking motivation. Interestingly, concern over COVID-19 infection was related to higher help-seeking motivation in both samples. Hence, our findings recommend the further development of telehealth services to (1) develop content beyond health education and symptom management that serves to enhance the perceived benefits of addressing women’s multidimensional menopausal health needs, (2) facilitate patient–care provider communication with a focus on self-efficacy and a propensity to engage in help-seeking behaviors, and (3) target women who have greater midlife health concerns in the postpandemic era. © 2024 Authors.

Five themes were identified: (i) Fa'atuatua ile Atua; Spiritual faith in God; (ii) It is a hush hush topic; stigma of mental illness; (iii) We are in the dark with our communication and dealings with the services; (v) Practice what you preach; clinical service delivery misaligned with the model of care; and (vi) Alofa (love) and fa'aaloalo (respect); enablers of positive experience. The findings overall highlight spirituality and religion as core to a Samoan's faith to foster resilience and healing when facing adverse mental health events with their family members. In addition, the need to build up capacity for Pacific staffed specialist services and Pacific model to achieve equity and holistic care for Samoans and other Pacific populations at risk of adverse mental health outcomes are recommended. © 2022 The Authors.

Community compliance with control measures was thus essential when pursuing elimination as a policy. Using a mixed-methods approach, we sought to explore whether New Zealand Police (NZP) were trusted to police the lockdown rules at Levels 4 and 3. We analyzed 1,020 survey responses comparing trust among respondents who had been stopped by NZP over the lockdown rules (contacts) with those who had not (non-contacts). We found that both contacts and non-contacts expressed greater trust in NZP to enforce the Level 4 than the Level 3 rules; contacts expressed less trust in NZP to enforce the lockdown rules than non-contacts; contacts perceived NZP more heavy-handed than non-contacts; contacts perceived NZP as only somewhat procedurally just and feeling somewhat encouraged to comply with the lockdown rules and; that unexpected high-profile policing-related events during the survey only affected contacts’ trust significantly. We offer two explanations: (1) NZP were perceived as procedurally unjust or inconsistent in applying the lockdown rules, (2) members of the public and NZP learned the lockdown rules simultaneously. We caution that the unfamiliar character of pandemic policing may jeopardize trust in NZP even among segments of the population that typically express high levels of trust in NZP, that is, people of European descent. We conclude that community compliance with pandemic control measures is no matter to be dealt with by the criminal legal system. © 2023 Georgia State University.","coronavirus; criminal justice; George Floyd effect; mission creep; procedural justice","","","","","","","","Aborisade R., Policing the lockdown: Accounts of police officers’ aggression and extortion of frontline health workers in Nigeria, Policing and Society, 31, 5, pp. 565-582, (2021); Alcadipani R., Pandemic and macho organizations: Wake-up call or business as usual?, Gender Work and Organization, 27, pp. 734-746, (2020); Anae M., All power to the people: Overstayers, Dawn raids and the Polynesian panthers, Tangata o le moana: New Zealand and the people of the Pacific, pp. 221-357, (2012); Anderson E., Burris E., Policing and public health: Not quite the right analogy, Policing and Society, 27, 3, pp. 300-313, (2016); Ashby M., Initial evidence on the relationship between the coronavirus pandemic and crime in the United States, Crime Science, 9, 1, pp. 1-16, (2020); Bolger P., Walters G., The relationship between police procedural justice, police legitimacy, and people’s willingness to cooperate with law enforcement: A meta-analysis, Journal of Criminal Justice, 60, pp. 93-99, (2019); Borrisenko S., (2021); Bull S., The land of murder, cannibalism, and all kinds of atrocious crimes?” Maori and Crime in New Zealand, 1853-1919, British Journal of Criminology, 44, 4, pp. 496-519, (2004); Bushway S., Forst B., Discretion in the criminal justice system, (2011); Cao L., Differentiating confidence in the police, trust in the police, and satisfaction with the police, Policing: An International Journal, 38, 2, pp. 239-249, (2015); (2021); Cheng D., (2020); (2018); Cunneen C., Tauri M., Indigenous criminology, (2016); Deckert A., Long N., Aikman P., Appleton N., Davies S., Fehoko E., Holroyd E., Jivraj N., Laws M., Martin-Anatias N., Roguski M., Simpson N., Sterling R., Trnka S., Tunufa'i L., Safer communities … together’?

Concurrent with these rising complex health needs is the importance of positive, non-judgmental attitudes of health services providers towards older adults. Moreover, this is particularly important in the nursing profession, given nurses' significant and crucial roles in healthcare settings. Aim: The study aimed to evaluate nurses’ attitudes towards older adults in a tertiary hospital in Ghana. Design: It employed a descriptive cross-sectional quantitative design. Method: Data were collected from 160 registered adult medical and surgical ward nurses using the Ageism Attitude Scale (AAS). Results: Findings indicated that more than half of the participants had a diploma in general nursing. None of the nurses surveyed specialized in the care of older adults, and the mean age of participants was 30.14 (3.75) (minimum 24 and maximum 42 years).

Although the surveyed nurses reported a somewhat positive attitude towards older adults, there was no correlation between nurses' education levels and positive attitudes. © 2022 The Authors.

Aim: To examine the cultural needs, beliefs and health seeking behaviours of migrant Turkish family member caregivers. Design: An ethnographic approach was used employing in depth interviews. Methods: Turkish caregivers residing in Melbourne, Australia were purposively sampled. Ten participants undertook face-to-face interviews in Turkish and English, followed by coding, transcription and thematic analysis. Results: Common themes were: (i) characteristics of MCI; (ii) care complicates our lives; (iii) beneficial coping strategies; (iv) adherence to cultural beliefs; (v) an uncertain future; (vi) interfacing with community health providers: need to understand Turkish culture (vii) need for long-term support. Migrant caregivers voiced undergoing considerable stress exacerbated by their cultural obligations. Conclusions: Establishing ethnically appropriate community support groups and advocating for a health workforce tier of representative migrant health care workers is recommended as a new role for community nurses. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","caregiving; community; migrant; mild cognitive impairment; Turkish","Anthropology, Cultural; Caregivers; Cognition Disorders; Emigration and Immigration; Humans; Pilot Projects; Turkey; Victoria; caregiver; cognitive defect; cultural anthropology; ethnology; human; migration; nursing; pilot study; Victoria","","","","","","","Adams K.B., The transition to caregiving: The experience of family members embarking on the dementia caregiving career, Journal of Gerontological Social Work, 47, 3-4, pp. 3-29, (2006); Perspectives on migrants (3416), (2013); Australian demographics statistics (3101.0), (2016); Basche J., Professional dilemmas for caregivers in Turkish home care settings in Germany, Border Crossing, 2014, 1, pp. 47-56, (2014); Bekman S., Aksu-Koc A., Perspectives on human development, family, and culture, (2009); Blieszner R., Roberto K.A., Care partner responses to the onset of mild cognitive impairment, The Gerontologist, 50, 1, pp. 11-22, (2010); Bowers D., House A., Owens D., Getting started in health research, (2011); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Bruce J.M., McQuiggan M., Williams V., Westervelt H., Tremont G., Burden among spousal and child caregivers of patients with mild cognitive impairment, Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders, 25, 4, pp. 385-390, (2008); Burnard P., Gill P., Stewart K., Treasure E., Chadwick B., Analysing and presenting qualitative data, British Dental Journal, 204, 8, pp. 429-432, (2008); Cope D., Methods and meanings: Credibility and trustworthiness of qualitative research, Oncology Nursing Forum, 41, 1, pp. 89-91, (2014); Creswell J.W., The selection of a research design.

Design/methodology/approach: A co-production approach was taken to review existing literature and policy to produce a position statement on how to better meet the needs of people who experience mental distress who are refugees. The co-production was between refugee and mental health researchers and refugee representatives. Findings: Understanding the mental health needs of refugees has conventionally focused on incidence of mental illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. If mental health and illness are understood as a continuum, diagnosis of mental illness indicates a significant problem, and furthermore access to services is predicated on risks associated with mental illness. When accessing mental health services, refugees have an added issue in a lack of communication availability and recognition of the trauma that they have survived. Originality/value: In this paper, a different position is advocated, that understanding the mental health of refugees can be framed more effectively as a process of recovery from trauma that emerges during resettlement, and over a long period of time before people are able to talk about the trauma they experienced. Community-based responses that enable recovery from trauma are more readily able to meet the mental health and wellbeing needs of refugee communities. © 2024, Tula Brannelly, Anjali Bhatia, Arezoo Zarintaj Malihi, Lucie Vanderpyl, Buster Brennan, Leo Gonzalez Perez, Fahima Saeid, Eleanor Holroyd and Nadia Charania.","Aotearoa New Zealand; Community approach; Mental health; Refugees; Trauma; Wellbeing","","","","","","","","Alegria M., NeMoyer A., Falgas Bague I., Wang Y., Alvarez K., Social determinants of mental health: where we are and where we need to go, Current Psychiatry Report, 20, 11, (2018); Barbui C., Tedeschi F., Acarturk C., Anttila M., Au T., Baumgartner J., Carswell K., Churchill R., Cuijpers P., Karyotaki E., Klein T., Koesters M., Lantta T., Nose M., Ostuzzi G., Pasquini M., Prina E., Sijbrandij M., Tarsitani L., Turrini G., Uygun E., Valimaki M., Walker L., Wancata J., White R.G., Purgato M., Risk factors for mental disorder development in asylum seekers and refugees resettled in Western Europe and Turkey: participant-level analysis of two large prevention studies, International Journal of Social Psychiatry, 69, 3, (2022); Bloom A., Udahemuka M., ‘Going through the doors of pain’: asylum seeker and convention refugee experiences in Aotearoa New Zealand, Kōtuitui: New Zealand Journal of Social Sciences Online, 9, 2, pp. 70-81, (2014); Bogic M., Priebe S., Njoku A., Long-term mental health of war-refugees: a systemic literature review, BMC International Health and Human Rights, 15, 1, (2015); Bracken P., Fernando S., Alsaraf S., Creed M., Double D., Gilberthorpe T., Hassan R., Jadhav S., Jeyapaul P., Kopua D., Parsons M., Rodger J., Summerfield D., Thomas P., Timimi S., Decolonising the medical curriculum: psychiatry faces particular challenges, Anthropology & Medicine, 28, 4, pp. 420-428, (2021); Byrow Y., Pajak R., Specker P., Nickerson A., Perceptions of mental health and perceived barriers to mental health help-seeking amongst refugees: a systematic review, Clinical Psychology Review, 75, (2020); Cenat J.M., Charles C.H., Kebedom P., Multiple traumas, health problems and resilience among Haitian asylum seekers in Canada’s 2017 migration crisis: psychopathology of crossing, Journal of Loss and Trauma, 25, 5, pp. 416-437, (2020); de Anstiss H., Ziaian T., Procter N., Warland J., Baghurst P., Help-seeking for mental health problems in young refugees: a review of the literature with implications for policy, practice, and research, Transcultural Psychiatry, 46, 4, pp. 584-607, (2009); DeSouza R., Sailing in a new direction: multicultural mental health in New Zealand, Australian e-Journal for the Advancement of Mental Health, 5, 2, pp. 155-165, (2006); Ellis B.H., Winer J.P., Murray K., Barrett C., Understanding the mental health of refugees: trauma, stress, and the cultural context, The Massachusetts General Hospital Textbook on Diversity and Cultural Sensitivity in Mental Health, pp. 253-273, (2019); Ferns M., Stephens M., Sama B., Maurice T., Perinpanayagam U., Stocker F., Marlowe J., Safe Start.

Method High schools were randomly selected, and the final sample comprised 25 schools. Students were divided into two groups ('living with both biological parents' vs 'not living with both biological parents'). Students were asked to rate their satisfaction with family life on a five-point Likert scale in a self-administered questionnaire. Dependent variables were sexual experience, sexual harassment, sexting and nude chats. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyse the results. Results 3907 students were included in the analysis. 202 students (5.2%) were sexually active. 505 students had ever (13.0%) sexually harassed others and 303 students (7.8%) had ever been sexually harassed by others. 58 students (1.5%) had ever had nude chats. 1005 students (25.8%) had sexted in the last 12 months. Students who lived with both biological parents were less like to be sexually active, to sext and to have nude chats than those who did not. Students who had higher family life satisfaction were less likely to be sexually active, to sexually harass others, to be sexually harassed by others, to sext and to have nude chats than students who had lower satisfaction with their family life. Conclusions Sexual health programmes and interventions should consider family functioning. Students who have low family satisfaction and those who do not live with both their biological parents should be targeted for sexual health interventions. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Background: The postnatal period is a stressful transition period for new fathers. It is imperative to understand their needs and experiences to provide appropriate support for them. The majority of previous studies were based in Western countries and explored fathers’ needs during pregnancy and childbirth, with few studies conducted in the postnatal period. In Singapore, a multiracial society with differing paternal cultural values from its Western counterparts, there is considerable need to examine the experiences and needs of first-time fathers. Design: A descriptive qualitative design was used. Methods: Data were collected from November 2015–January 2016. Fifteen first-time fathers were recruited from two postnatal wards of a public hospital, using a purposive sampling method. A semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct face-to-face interviews. A thematic analysis was conducted and ethics approval was sought for this study. Results: Four overarching themes and seventeen subthemes were generated. The four overarching themes were: (1) No sense of reality to sense of responsibility; (2) Unprepared and challenged; (3) Support: needs, sources, experience and attitude; and (4) Future help for fathers. Conclusion: Fathers undergo a transition phase where they have unmet support needs during the early postnatal period. Understanding and addressing these needs may facilitate smooth transition to fatherhood. This study's findings can be used to involve fathers and design future supportive educational programs to promote positive parenting experiences and family dynamics. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","early postnatal period; experiences; fathers; interviews; midwives; nurses; nursing; support needs","Adult; Attitude; Fathers; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mobile Applications; Qualitative Research; Self Efficacy; Sleep Deprivation; Social Support; child parent relation; childbirth; cultural value; ethics; family study; father; human; midwife; nurse; perinatal period; pregnancy; public hospital; puerperium; qualitative research; responsibility; sampling; semi structured interview; Singapore; thematic analysis; adult; attitude; father; health service; male; mobile application; newborn; psychology; qualitative research; self concept; sleep deprivation; social support","","","","","National University of Singapore, NUS, (NUHSRO/2015/063/SU/01); National University Health System, NUHS","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the National University of Singapore for the start-up grant.

This highlights a lack of public policies and social support for older women facing disabilities, aging, and dementia. Labelling them as witches and isolating them from their families and familiar surroundings profoundly impacts their emotional well-being. However, little is known about the mental health of older women in witch camps in northern Ghana. This study interviewed 15 women from the Gambaga witches camp, identifying five main themes and 21 related sub-themes: ‘Physical and Mental Health Issues,’ ‘Psychological Impacts of Displacement and Trauma,’ ‘Social Isolation and Emotional Distress,’ ‘Living Conditions,’ and ‘Community Support and Strategies for Improving Well-being.’ The sub-themes included ‘Physical problems (chronic body pain) impacting upon general health and well-being’, ‘Anxiety and nervousness’, ‘Sleep and restlessness- “can’t sit still”, ‘Suicidal thoughts and anger’, ‘Forgetfulness’, ‘Concentration and confusion’, ‘Loneliness, sadness from family disconnection’ and ‘stigma – self and others’, ‘Loss of respect and dignity (‘Dariza’)’, ‘Frailty and loss of independence’, ‘Feelings of helplessness, unhappiness, and despair’, ‘Lack of family support and dignity’, ‘Lack of basic needs, and inadequate social facilities’. Findings revealed the negative effects of cultural beliefs and discrimination on the mental health of these women. Addressing public stigma and challenging these beliefs can improve healthcare and outcomes, allowing older women to stay connected with their families, reduce depression, and lead meaningful lives. © The Author(s) 2024.","Camps; Ghana; Mental health; Older women; Witchcraft","","","","","","","","Adinkrah M., Child witch hunts in contemporary Ghana, Child Abuse Neglect, 35, 9, pp. 741-752, (2011); Andersen J.G., Marginalization, citizenship and the economy: the capacities of the universalist welfare state in Denmark, (1996); Arnskov C.M., Camping with Witches Doc.Rct.Dk/Doc/Mon2013.055, (2012); Baba I.M., Life in a Witch Camp Experiences of Residents in the Gnani Witch Camp in Ghana Universitas Bergensis, (2013); Bekoe P.O., Religion and Human Rights of Women and Children at the Gambaga Witch Camp in the Northern Region of Ghana, (2016); Bourgois P., Confronting Anthropological Ethics: Ethnographic lessons from Central America, Journal of Peace Research, 27, 1, pp. 43-54, (1990); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Braun V., Clarke V., Thematic analysis, In, pp. 57-71, (2012); Cacioppo J.T., Cacioppo S., Older adults reporting social isolation or loneliness show poorer cognitive function 4 years later, Evidence-Based Nursing, 17, 2, pp. 59-60, (2014); Cacioppo J.T., Cacioppo S., The growing problem of loneliness, Lancet, 391, (2018); Chaudhuri S., Women as easy scapegoats: Witchcraft accusations and women as targets in tea plantations of India, Violence against Women, 18, 10, pp. 1213-1234, (2012); De Hert M., Correll C.U., Bobes J., Cetkovich-Bakmas M., Cohen D., Asai I., Detraux J., Gautam S., Moller H.J., Ndetei D.M., Physical illness in patients with severe mental disorders.

There is limited evidence regarding the attitudes and beliefs of parents towards the implementation of school-based CSE programmes in Islamic cultural settings, including Oman, which this mixed-method study set out to explore. A convenience sample of 250 parents, with equal numbers of mothers and fathers of children aged 12–14 years (grades 7–9) at two urban public pre-secondary schools in Saham, completed a paper-based self-administered questionnaire in Arabic. We found most parents (72.8%) supported school-based CSE programmes that conformed to Islamic requirements of pre-marital sexual abstinence, but there was some opposition. Almost all parents supported comprehensive age-appropriate CSE being taught to students aged 10–15 years, including topics perceived as controversial in Omani culture, except for birth control and safer sex. Most parents considered themselves, school teachers and school nurses to be important sources of CSE. The study findings which suggest strong parental support for CSE programmes can facilitate education policy, CSE curriculum decision-makers and school healthcare-providers in Oman, other Middle Eastern countries, and countries with Muslim immigrant populations. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attitudes; beliefs; Comprehensive sexuality education; Islam; Oman; sexual and reproductive health","adolescent; article; birth control; child; controlled study; education program; health care personnel; health education; human; human experiment; immigrant; Islam; Oman; reproductive health; safe sex; school child; school health nursing; school teacher; sexual abstinence; student","","","","","","","Almany M., Sahih Bukhari, (2009); Alquaiz A.M., Almuneef M.A., Minhas H.R., Knowledge, Attitudes, and Resources of Sex Education among Female Adolescents in Public and Private Schools in Central Saudi Arabia, Saudi Medical Journal, 33, 9, pp. 1001-1009, (2012); ARCSHS Annual Report 2016, (2016); Barr E.M., Moore M.J., Johnson T., Forrest J., Jordan M., New Evidence: Data Documenting Parental Support for Earlier Sexuality Education, Journal of School Health, 84, 1, pp. 10-17, (2014); Borawski E.A., Tufts K.A., Trapl E.S., Hayman L.L., Yoder L.D., Lovegreen L.D., Effectiveness of Health Education Teachers and School Nurses Teaching Sexually Transmitted Infections/Human Immunodeficiency Virus Prevention Knowledge and Skills in Sigh School, Journal of School Health, 85, 3, pp. 189-196, (2015); Byers E.S., Sears H.A., Weaver A.D., Parents’ Reports of Sexual Communication with Children in Kindergarten to Grade 8, Journal of Marriage and Family, 70, 1, pp. 86-96, (2008); Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2016, (2017); Cohen J., Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1988); Collier-Harris C.A., Goldman J.D.G., What Educational Contexts Should Teachers Consider for Their Puberty Education Programmes?, Educational Review, 69, 1, pp. 118-133, (2017); DeJong J., Jawad R., Mortagy I., Shepard B., The Sexual and Reproductive Health of Young People in the Arab Countries and Iran, Reproductive Health Matters, 13, 25, pp. 49-59, (2005); Parents and Sex Education: Parents’ Attitudes to Sexual Health Education in WA Schools, (2010); Duffy B., Fotinatos N., Smith A., Burke J., Puberty, Health and Sexual Education in Australian Regional Primary Schools: Year 5 and 6 Teacher Perceptions, Sex Education, 13, 2, pp. 186-203, (2013); Farrag S., Hayter M., A Qualitative Study of Egyptian School Nurses’ Attitudes and Experiences toward Sex and Relationship Education, Journal of School Nursing, 30, 1, pp. 49-56, (2014); Ganczak M., Barss P., Alfaresi F., Almazrouei S., Muraddad A., Al-Maskari F., Break the Silence: HIV/AIDS Knowledge, Attitudes, and Educational Needs among Arab University Students in United Arab Emirates, Journal of Adolescent Health, 40, 6, (2007); Grossman J.M., Tracy A.J., Charmaraman L., Ceder I., Erkut S., Protective Effects of Siddle School Comprehensive Sex Education with Family Involvement, Journal of School Health, 84, 11, pp. 739-747, (2014); Haberland N., Rogow D., Sexuality Education: Emerging Trends in Evidence and Practice, Journal of Adolescent Health, 56, 1, pp. S15-S21, (2015); Jaffer Y.A., Afifi M., Al Ajmi F., Alouhaishi K., Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of Secondary-School Pupils in Oman: II.

Recognizing that social connections and feelings of normality are important for public health, this study examines whether, and for whom, that goal is realized, and identifies obstacles that may inhibit its achievement. Methods: Thematic analysis of narratives obtained via a qualitative cross-sectional survey of a community cohort in Aotearoa | New Zealand. Results: A majority of participants reported that life after elimination was 'more or less the same' as before the pandemic. Some became more social. Nevertheless, a sizeable minority reported being less social, even many months after elimination. Key obstacles to social recovery included fears that the virus was circulating undetected and the enduring impact of lockdowns upon social relationships, personal habits and mental health. Within our sample, old age and underlying health conditions were both associated with a propensity to become less social. Conclusions: Elimination strategies can successfully allow 'normal social life' to resume. However, this outcome is not guaranteed. People may encounter difficulties with re-establishing social connections in Zero-COVID settings. Measures designed to overcome such obstacles should be an integral part of elimination strategies.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2022.

Background: Female sex workers (FSWs) are often considered as the vector, if not reservoir, of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Building upon the existing evidence on the role of psychological health in sexual health, the aim of this protocol is to describe a trial investigating the effectiveness of the Personal Resilience and Enrichment Programme (PREP), a resilience-promoting intervention that targets at psychological well-being i.e. self-esteem, self-efficacy and coping, to facilitate adaptation and ultimately safe sexual practices among FSWs, which could be an innovative strategy in controlling the spread of these infections. Methods. A total of 132 FSWs will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention or usual care (control) groups in a multi-centred randomised controlled trial. Based on the resilience framework, this intervention is comprised of six weekly sessions focused on the awareness, expression and management of emotions, identifying roles and personal strengths, and effective problem-solving skills. Complex intervention assessment on both intervention process and effectiveness will be adopted when the primary outcome reduction of sexual risk behaviour and other psychological outcomes include their perceived stress, self-esteem, self-efficacy, coping overall resilience, and psychological distress will be measured at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month post-intervention and differences assessed by ANOVA. The relationship of resilience factors, psychological health and HIV preventive behaviours will be evaluated using structural equation modelling. Discussion. It is anticipated that this study will increase our understanding of the relationships between individual resilience attributes, positive adaptation, psychological health and sexual health practices. If successful, this programme will provide an innovative direction for HIV prevention by applying the personal resilience factors to promote both psychological well-being and safe sex for this high risk population.

Our study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate an Islamic-based intervention program to promote medication adherence among Muslim older adults with uncontrolled hypertension in southern Thailand. Method: An action research with codesign and family participation principles was utilized. Within action research cycles, interviews with Thai-Muslim older adults, family primary caregivers, and health care professionals were undertaken alongside participant observations. Results: A qualitative audit demonstrated an improved medication adherence with all stakeholders expressing their desire to further engage and maintain the new intervention program. Discussion: Engaging with Islamic doctrine and concepts of family participation could support an improvement in antihypertensive medication adherence for Muslim older adults. Codesigning enables recognition of community belief systems, forming an important step toward improving community-based medication adherence. © The Author(s) 2022.","action research; family participation; Islamic doctrine; medication adherence; older adults; Thai-Muslim","Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Health Services Research; Humans; Hypertension; Islam; Medication Adherence; Thailand; antihypertensive agent; aged; health services research; human; hypertension; Islam; medication compliance; Thailand","","Antihypertensive Agents, ","","","Prince of Songkla University, PSU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was partially supported by graduate school, Prince of Songkla University.

Methods Osteopathic practitioners were purposively selected resulting in eight participants from eight clinics in different demographic regions of Melbourne, Australia. In depth interviews were conducted and data was analysed using grounded theory methodology. Results Results demonstrate that an understanding of holism in osteopathic health care (in education and clinical practice) required an “awareness of relationships”. The emerging theory relates concept and educational framework (i.e. both biomedical and holistic philosophical approaches), with the practice of holism and describes what holism means within the context of an individual treatment. Conclusion Implications are for osteopathic education to provide a balanced emphasis between holistic and biomedical frameworks and theoretical insight into understanding patients presenting with chronic health issues. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Grounded theory; Healing; Health care; Holism; Osteopathy","adult; Article; Australia; awareness; clinical article; clinical education; clinical practice; controlled study; demography; ethics; female; grounded theory; health care planning; holism; human; knowledge; male; osteopathic medicine; patient selection; physician; rigor","","","","","","","Baer H., The emergence of integrative medicine in Australia: the growing interest of biomedicine and nursing in complementary medicine in a southern developed society, Med Anthropol Q, 22, pp. 52-66, (2008); McEvoy L., Duffy A., Holistic practice – a concept analysis, Nurse Educ Pract, 8, pp. 412-419, (2008); Paterson C., Britten N., The patient's experience of holistic care: insights from acupuncture research, Chronic Illn, 4, pp. 264-277, (2008); Strandberg E.L., Ovhed I., Borgquist L., Wilhelmsson S., The perceived meaning of a (w)holistic view among general practitioners and district nurses in Swedish primary care: a qualitative study, BMC Fam Pract, 8, (2007); Nissen N., Perspectives on holism in the contemporary practice of Western herbal medicine in the UK, J Herb Med, 1, pp. 76-82, (2011); Solli H.M., Da Silva A.B., The holistic claims of the biopsychosocial conception of WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF): a conceptual analysis on the basis of a pluralistic-holistic ontology and multidimensional view of the human being, J Med Philos (United Kingdom), 37, pp. 277-294, (2012); Willis K.F., Rayner J.-A., Integrative medical doctors—public health practitioner or lifestyle coach?, Eur J Integr Med, 5, pp. 8-14, (2013); Keshet Y., Ben-Arye E., Schiff E., Can holism be practiced in a biomedical setting?

A cross-sectional survey of Buddhist religious practices and blood pressure was conducted with 160 Buddhist elderly in rural Uttaradit, northern Thailand. After controlling for the variables of gender, status, education, salary, underlying hypertension, exercise, salt intake, and taking antihypertensive medications, it was found that lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure is associated with the Buddhist religious practice of temple attendance. The Buddhist older people who regularly attended a temple every Buddhist Holy day (which occurs once a week) were found to have systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings lower than people who did not attend as regularly. It is recommended that nurses advocate for temple attendance in the care protocols for older Buddhist hypertensive patients both in Thailand and internationally. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Blood pressure; Buddhism; Religion; Spirituality; Thailand","Aged; Blood Pressure; Buddhism; Chi-Square Distribution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet, Sodium-Restricted; Exercise; Female; Food Habits; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Rural Population; Self Report; Social Class; Social Support; Thailand; aged; attitude to health; blood pressure; Buddhism; chi square distribution; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; exercise; feeding behavior; female; human; hypertension; male; middle aged; multicenter study; physiology; psychology; rural population; self report; social class; social support; sodium restriction; Thailand","","","","","","","(2012); Balaji P.A., Varne S.R., Ali S.S., Physiological effects of yogic practices and transcendental meditation in health and disease, N.

The aim of this review was to critically examine literature on the health and well-being of this population group. Methods: An integrative literature review was conducted from December 2017 to February 2018. Online databases searched were Scopus, MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Australia/New Zealand Reference Centre. Results: Two themes were identified: Firstly, the “challenges stemming from an unfamiliar environment” faced by older Asian immigrants, and secondly, their “strategies for adjusting to a new home.” These themes suggested how participation in community and leisure activities, as well as adapting their outlook on life, contributed to these older migrants’ health and well-being within a New Zealand context. Conclusion: A multitude of challenges in maintaining health and well-being confronted these older Asian immigrants; nevertheless, they created strategies to respond and positively influence their health following later-life migration. © 2019 AJA Inc.","aged; Asians; health; immigrants; New Zealand","Adaptation, Psychological; Aged; Asia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cultural Characteristics; Emigrants and Immigrants; Family Relations; Female; Healthy Aging; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Quality of Life; Social Participation; article; Asian; Australia; Cinahl; human; immigrant; Medline; New Zealand; Scopus; systematic review; wellbeing; aged; Asia; Asian continental ancestry group; coping behavior; cultural factor; epidemiology; ethnology; family relation; female; healthy aging; male; middle aged; migrant; New Zealand; psychology; quality of life; social participation","","","","","Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT","Funding information Jaden De-Arth received a “Summer Studentship” scholarship from Auckland University of Technology, Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences, for work carried out on December 2017–March 2018.

Rates of mental illnesses also differ between those born in Tonga and those born in New Zealand. However, little is known about the personalized and culturally shaped meaning and experience of mental distress in this population. Therefore, this research explored the meaning of mental distress for Tongan men and community leaders living in Auckland, New Zealand. The Tongan cultural framework, talanoa (talking, to tell), enabled a culturally congruent and collective approach to examining mental health-related ideologies and ensuing distress. Two talanoa groups were held (one with men and one with community leaders), with a total of 18 participants. The primary research questions focused on tufunga faka-Tonga (Tongan constructions of mental distress). Four themes emerged: fa’unga (reality), hu‘unga (directionality), ta‘anga (temporality), and tu‘unga (positionality). The analytic lens used to define reality was fa‘unga, because this concept encompasses the creation/preservation of sino (body), me‘a (thing, something), and mo‘oni (truth, real). The findings suggested that it is necessary to incorporate tufunga faka-Tonga into all aspects of service delivery to improve mental health services for the Tongan population. The Tongan community will benefit from increased awareness of tufunga faka-paiōsaikosōsiolo (biopsychosocial constructions of mental distress) and tufunga fepaki mo e fetaulaki he vaha‘a ‘o e tufunga faka-paiōsaikosōsiolo mo e tufunga faka-Tonga (intersections between biopsychosocial and Tongan constructions of mental distress) to support identification of health risks and health service seeking behaviours. © 2020 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.","ethnic mental health; indigenous; mental distress; Pacific mental health; tongan mental health","Ethnic Groups; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; New Zealand; Tonga; ethnic group; human; male; mental disease; mental health; New Zealand; Tonga","","","","","Health Research Council of New Zealand, HRC","This was part of a doctorate study to examine the Tongan constructions and interpretations of mental distress that was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand.","Bloomfield S.F., Illness and cure in Tonga, traditional and modern medical practice Nuku‘alofa, (2002); Braun V., Clarke C., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Collocott E.E.V., The Supernatural in Tonga, American Anthropologist, 23, 4, (1921); Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Reserach, (2011); Fernando S., Mental health, race and culture, (2010); Foliaki S., Migration and mental health: The tongan experience, International Journal of Mental Health, 26, 3, pp. 36-54, (1997); Foliaki S.A., Mental health among Tongan migrants, Pacific health dialog, 6, pp. 288-294, (1999); Foliaki S.A., Kokaua J., Schaaf D., Tukuitonga C., Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of mental disorders and treatment contact among Pacific people in Te Rau Hinengaro: The New Zealand Mental Health Survey, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 40, 10, pp. 924-934, (2006); Fonua P., Talanoa, talking from the heart, (2005); Gifford E.G., Tongan Society, (1929); Goffman E., Asylums.

The purpose of this integrative review was to update what is currently known about blended learning within the Aotearoa New Zealand and Australian nursing education context and to generate new perspectives to inform the evidence-based use of blended learning. An integrative review approach was utilised. Systematic searches of the databases Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, ERIC via Ovid, PsychInfo via Ovid, and Google Scholar were conducted. Articles were included for review if they were published between 2010 and 2020 and reported on research involving a combination of online and face-to-face teaching in undergraduate nursing programmes in Aotearoa New Zealand or Australia that led to a registered nurse qualification. All seven articles that met the inclusion criteria were from Australia and were published between 2016 and 2020. The findings were analysed and summarised into five main categories: definitions of blended learning; teacher qualities; benefits of blended learning; challenges of the blended learning approach; and future considerations. While this review found that teacher qualities influenced students’ perceptions and experiences of blended learning, further research is needed on how teachers perceived and experienced blended learning. While COVID-19 has accelerated the use of online and blended learning internationally; this review identified a lack of empirical knowledge on the efficacy and experience of blended learning across nursing education in Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia. A more nuanced definition of blended learning would assist researchers and educators to develop effective and adaptable blended learning teaching strategies in the Aotearoa New Zealand and Australian context. With increased directives for adaptable blended learning modalities within nursing education, this review of the current literature within Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia was timely and will provide important updates for nurse educators on how best to provide blended learning and provide a framework for future research. © 2021, Nursing Praxis in New Zealand.

Convenience sampling method was used to recruit 8 parents of preterm infants. Semistructured face-to-face in-depth interviews were used to collect data between November 2013 and February 2014. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Four themes were identified: ""negative emotions versus positive emotions,"" ""finding ways forward,"" ""nature of support received from various sources,"" and ""need more informational and professional support."" Parents of preterm infants experienced a multitude of emotions that varied from shock and sadness to excitement and anticipation through their babies' birth, hospitalization, and impending discharge. These parents adopted several strategies to cope with their birth and subsequent infant hospitalization. While their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) experience was perceived as positive for most parents, some suggestions were made to improve on the information provided and professional care. This study provides evidence to health care professionals in addressing parents' negative emotions and coping abilities in practice. Emotional and informational support for parents is important for them to be more competent in coping with the hospitalization of their newborn in the NICU. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","neonatal intensive care; parents; perceptions; preterm infants; Singapore","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Emotional Intelligence; Emotions; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Male; Parents; Patient Discharge; Professional-Family Relations; Qualitative Research; Quality Improvement; Singapore; Social Perception; adult; coping behavior; emotion; emotional intelligence; ethics; female; hospital discharge; human; human relation; male; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; parent; perception; prematurity; psychology; qualitative research; Singapore; standards; total quality management","","","","","","","Preterm Birth; Preemie; Blencowe H., Cousens S., Chou D., Et al., 15 Million Preterm Births: Priorities for Action Based On National, Regional and Global Estimates.

We sought to enhance limited information about the unique barriers to parent-adolescent SRH communication in the Arab states. This mixed-methods study, using a two-phase sequential explorative design, was conducted in 15 public secondary schools (with grades 5 to 10 students aged 10 to 15 years) in Oman. In phase one, 15 parents participated in two single-sex focus group discussions and two in-depth individual interviews. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. In phase two, a convenience sample of 250 parents completed a paper-based self-administered questionnaire. Findings showed that parents rarely communicated with their children about SRH concerns, including HIV. Barriers to more open parent-adolescent SRH communication include the fear that such discussion might encourage early sexual debut; feelings of shyness, discomfort and shame; associated socio-cultural taboos; gender mismatch; and lack of SRH knowledge. Findings suggest the need for parental SRH education and training and school based SRH education programmes to improve adolescent SRH. Experience developing these may be helpful to other countries with similar religious beliefs and socio-cultural traditions seeking to improve parent-adolescent SRH communication. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; communication; Islam; oman; parental attitudes; Sexual and reproductive health education","adolescent; Arab; article; attitude to health; child; clinical article; convenience sample; fear; female; gender; health education; high school; human; human experiment; Human immunodeficiency virus; interview; Islam; male; medical information; nonhuman; Oman; parental attitude; questionnaire; reproductive health; shame; shyness; taboo; thematic analysis","","","","","Oman Ministry of Education; RMIT University Science Engineering & Health College","In the phase one face-to-face element of the work, written informed consent was obtained from all participants before Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted.

Despite this inevitability, death today remains unwelcome and has been sequestered into the enclaves of medical practice as a means of quelling the rising tide of fear it provokes. Medical practice currently maintains power over the dying individual, actualised through the selective collaboration between medicine and law as a means of subverting the individual who attempts to disrupt the contemporary accepted norms of dying. There is, however, a shift on the horizon as to whether we can make the notion of a true choice become a reality in New Zealand. This serves to offer a compelling movement towards individuals seeking control of their dying trajectory to actualise the notion of individual choice. With this shifting landscape there is an opportunity to be grasped to change how we manage our dying trajectory away from the biomedical patterns of behaviour when dying, in order to balance life decisions. To achieve this prospect, we need to engage with a framework upon which to pin the changes. This paper offers a re-framing and re-presenting approach, using illustrative examples that draw upon British and New Zealand literature, together with over 50 years of professional nursing, and the Ars Moriendi to reflect upon the self-centricity of the contemporary Western individual to access a ‘good death’ of choice. © 2018 by the authors.

This single case study, drawing on the 2013 eruption of Mount Sinabung, Indonesia, aimed to investigate the experiences of pregnant women and the perspectives of community leaders on the accessibility and the provision of MRH services during the emergency response phase. The study was conducted between August 2017 and April 2018 in the newly relocated villages in Siosar Kabanjahe, Karo district. Data were collected from two stakeholder groups over two phases. Phase 1 with 10 women who were pregnant at the time of the eruption. Phase 2 with 16 community leaders. Data were thematically analysed and utilised NVivo software. While there were considerable efforts to provide MRH services following the eruption, these were described as inadequate. The activation of local disaster management authorities and provision of free-of-charge MRH services were seen as imperative to improving the disaster responses. To improve responses in future disasters, health authorities are recommended to upscale health information systems in emergencies, educate health professionals on Disaster Risk Management (DRM), improve guidelines related to temporary shelter and improve multi-sectoral coordination to ensure MRH provision is aligned with DRM policies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","disaster risk management; Indonesia; Maternal and reproductive health; pregnant women; volcanic eruption","Adolescent; Adult; Disaster Planning; Emergencies; Female; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Maternal Health Services; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Reproductive Health Services; Risk Management; Volcanic Eruptions; adult; article; clinical article; disaster; female; human; human experiment; Indonesia; leadership; medical information system; practice guideline; pregnancy; pregnant woman; reproductive health; risk management; software; volcano; adolescent; adverse event; disaster planning; emergency; health service; Indonesia; male; maternal health service; middle aged; organization and management; risk management; volcano","","","","","Karo District; Ministry of Health of Indonesia; National Disaster Management Authority of Indonesia; United Nations Population Fund, Government of North Sumatera Province; University of Auckland","The authors would like to thank women and community leaders participants, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia, National Disaster Management Authority of Indonesia, United Nations Population Fund, Government of North Sumatera Province, and Karo District.

Knowledge gaps exist regarding the longer life and resilience-related experiences of people living with HIV (PLWH). Specifically, there is a dearth of data about the interaction of perceived risk and resilient factors resulting in a wide spectrum of intentional suicidal ideation outcomes in a Chinese cultural context. This qualitative research drew from a larger ethnographic study of newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in Mainland China. Interviews were conducted with 31 MSM within 6 months of diagnosis of HIV infection. Initial suicidal ideation was commonly reported with participants subsequently feeling more resilient to these thoughts through gaining a greater understanding of their prognosis and treatment. Post-HIV diagnosis, some participants reported forming new relationships and receiving increased support from their partners, friends, peers, families, and community-based organizations. At follow-up, these participants generally reported suicidal ideation had declined. However, participants who continued to express suicidal ideation perceived extended pressure from their families’ expectations for them to engage in heterosexual marriages and parenthood. Furthermore, these men reported ongoing hardships in their daily life, unemployment, lack of social support, and isolation. Among this Mainland Chinese cohort of HIV-positive MSM, suicidal ideation may be a transient phenomenon experienced initially following HIV diagnosis that resolves with increased and specific familial, social, and service-based support. It is crucial to identify the causes of stress and social suffering associated with HIV diagnosis in order to reduce suicidal ideation. In China, action is needed to develop routine mental health screening and to increase services that support PLWH. Important services mechanism to accomplish this are promoting resilience through intentional activities as well as continued public health campaigns to reduce stigma toward HIV-positive MSM. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","China; HIV; Men who have sex with men; Resilience; Sexual orientation; Suicidal ideation","Adolescent; Adult; China; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Suicidal Ideation; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; China; HIV Infections; human; male; male homosexuality; psychology; qualitative research; statistics and numerical data; suicidal ideation; young adult","","","","","Center for Health Behaviors Research of the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care; China National Offshore Oil Corporation, CNOOC; Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK","This research was funded by the Center for Health Behaviors Research of the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care (JCSPHPC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), a postgraduate study Grant in JCSPHPC, and the Global Scholarship Programme for Research Excellence—CNOOC Grants 2010–2011 in CUHK.

This review aimed to explore the associations between the psychological health of FSWs and HIV risk. A total of eight studies published in English before July 2013 were identified and reviewed. FSWs had reported psychological issues, including depression, suicidal thoughts as well as lower quality of life, and the pooled prevalence of probable depression was as high as 62.4%. The majority of studies showed that higher scores in psychological health problems were associated with increased HIV risk behavior, in particular inconsistent condom use, or sexually transmitted infections. Among the five studies which measured symptoms of depression, four documented that higher depression scores were significantly associated with inconsistent condom use among FSWs with their clients and/or partners. Meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed to examine the association between depression and inconsistent condom use and found that higher scores in depression were significantly associated with inconsistent condom use (odds ratio = 2.57, p <.001). This review contends that future HIV preventive interventions should take psychological health of FSWs into consideration. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","harm reduction; HIV prevention; prostitution; psychological health; risk behaviors","Condoms; Depression; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Risk Reduction Behavior; Safe Sex; Sex Workers; Sexual Partners; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; behavior; condom use; depression; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; mental health; prevalence; priority journal; prostitution; psychological aspect; quality of life; Review; risk factor; sexually transmitted disease; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; systematic review; unprotected sex; condom; depression; mental health; psychology; quality of life; risk reduction; safe sex; sex worker; sexuality; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; transmission; utilization","","","","","","","Agha S., Chulu Nchima M., Life-circumstances, working conditions and HIV risk among street and nightclub-based sex workers in Lusaka, Zambia, Culture, Health & Sexuality, 6, 4, pp. 283-299, (2004); Ajzen I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior, Action control: From cognition to Behavior, pp. 11-39, (1985); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior, (1980); Alegria M., Vera M., Freeman D.H., Robles R., Santos M.D.C., Rivera C.L., HIV infection, risk behaviors, and depressive symptoms among Puerto Rican sex workers, American Journal of Public Health, 84, 12, pp. 2000-2002, (1994); Basuki E., Wolffers I., Deville W., Erlaini N., Luhpuri D., Hargono R., Beelen N.V., Reasons for not using condoms among female sex workers in Indonesia, AIDS Education and Prevention, 14, 2, pp. 102-116, (2002); Beck A., Depression: Clinical, experimental, and theoretical aspects, (1967); Catania J.A., Kegeles S.M., Coates T.J., Towards an understanding of risk behavior: An AIDS risk reduction model (ARRM), Health Education Quarterly, 17, pp. 53-72, (1990); Crepaz N., Marks G., Are negative affective states associated with HIV sexual risk behaviors?

Many studies have been conducted to understand users' adoption of the clinical decision support system. A critical review was conducted to understand the theoretical or conceptual frameworks used to inform the studies on the adoption of the clinical decision support system. The review identified 15 theoretical and conceptual frameworks using multiple hybrids of theories and concepts. The Technology Acceptance Model was the most frequently used baseline framework combined with frameworks such as the diffusion of innovation, social theory, longitudinal theory, and so on. The results from these articles yielded multiple concepts influencing the adoption of the clinical decision support system. These concepts can be recategorized into nine major concepts, namely, the information system, person (user or patient), social, organization, perceived benefits, emotions, trustability, relevance (fitness), and professionalism. None of the studies found all the nine concepts. That said, most of them have identified the information system, organization, and person concepts as three of its concepts affecting the use of the clinical decision support system. Within each of the concepts, its subconcepts were noted to be very varied. Yet each of these subconcepts has significantly contributed toward the different facets of the concepts. A pluralistic framework was built using the concepts and subconcepts to provide an overall framework construct for future study on the adoption of the clinical decision support system.

Auricular diagnostics is an objective, painless, and noninvasive method that provides rapid access to information. Thus, the association between auricular signals and coronary heart disease (CHD) should be further investigated. A case control study was conducted to determine the predictive value of auricular signals on 100 cases of CHD (CHD+ve = 50; CHD-ve = 50) via visual inspection, electrical skin resistance measurement, and tenderness testing. The results showed that the presence of an ear lobe crease (ELC) was significantly associated with coronary heart disease. The ""heart"" zone of the CHD+ve group significantly exhibited higher conductivity on both ears than that of the controls. The CHD+ve group experienced significant tenderness in the ""heart"" region compared with those in the CHD-ve group in both acute and chronic conditions. Further studies that take into consideration the impact of age, race, and earlobe shape on ELC prevalence in a larger sample should be done. © 2012 Lorna Kwai-Ping Suen et al.","","adult; aged; article;

These opportunities create a ""double-edge sword,"" as the ethical governance of such approaches often lags behind technological achievements. Objective: The aim was to investigate ethical issues identified from utilizing artificial intelligence-augmented surveillance or early warning systems to monitor and detect common or novel infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: In a number of databases, we searched relevant articles that addressed ethical issues of using artificial intelligence, digital surveillance systems, early warning systems, and/or big data analytics technology for detecting, monitoring, or tracing infectious diseases according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, and further identified and analyzed them with a theoretical framework. Results: This systematic review identified 29 articles presented in 6 major themes clustered under individual, organizational, and societal levels, including awareness of implementing digital surveillance, digital integrity, trust, privacy and confidentiality, civil rights, and governance. While these measures were understandable during a pandemic, the public had concerns about receiving inadequate information; unclear governance frameworks; and lack of privacy protection, data integrity, and autonomy when utilizing infectious disease digital surveillance. The barriers to engagement could widen existing health care disparities or digital divides by underrepresenting vulnerable and at-risk populations, and patients' highly sensitive data, such as their movements and contacts, could be exposed to outside sources, impinging significantly upon basic human and civil rights.

However, linkage to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care is not yet achieved very well among people living with HIV. We conducted a qualitative study to explore individual and contextual factors that may influence a linkage to HIV care from the perspective of young HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) in a highly centralized HIV care context of China. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 21 HIV-infected MSM in Shandong Province, with in-depth interviews conducted between March and July 2015. Thematic content analysis was subsequently used for data analysis. Results: Key barriers and facilitators related to a linkage to HIV care emerged from participants' narratives. The barriers included perceived healthy status, low health literacy, and stigma associated with receiving HIV care. The facilitators included an awareness of responsibility, knowledge associated with health literacy, social support, and trusting and relying on services provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the government. These were related to the quality of current HIV counselling and testing, service promotion, and the cost and placement of these HIV services. Conclusions: In order to improve the MSM linkage to HIV care in China, it is imperative to improve the quality of the current on-going counselling and testing. Further critical linkage support includes increasing supportive services among local CDC systems, designated hospitals and community-based organizations (CBOs), and more financial support for HIV/AIDS related testing, medical checkups and treatments. © 2017 The Author(s).","China; HIV; Linkage to care; Men who have sex with men; Qualitative","Adolescent; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Awareness; China; Communicable Diseases; Counseling; Financial Support; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Literacy; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Social Responsibility; Social Stigma; Social Support; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; Asian continental ancestry group; attitude to health; awareness; China; communicable disease; counseling; ethnology; financial management; health care delivery; health literacy; health status; HIV Infections; human; male; male homosexuality; psychology; qualitative research; social behavior; social stigma; social support; statistics and numerical data; young adult","","","","","South China-UNC STD Research Training Center, (FIC 1D43TW009532-02); UNC Project-China; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (R01AI114310); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID","The study reported in this article was supported by NIH R01 grant (NIAID 1R01AI114310-01), UNC Project-China, and the South China-UNC STD Research Training Center (FIC 1D43TW009532-02).","Keller S.C., Yehia B.R., Eberhart M.G., Brady K.A., Accuracy of definitions for linkage to care in persons living with HIV, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 63, 5, pp. 622-630, (2013); Clinical guidelines across the continuum of care: Linking people diagnosed with HIV infection to HIV care and treatment.

This article explores how people experienced this situation, asking why restrictions that some described as precipitating ‘the most difficult time of their lives’ were described by others as a ‘relief’, ‘blessing’, or ‘gift’. Much existing literature frames funerary restrictions as a distressing assault upon established ways of grieving to which mourners must try to adapt–and in Aotearoa, both the stringency of the restrictions and the means by which they had been imposed did lead to many people finding them challenging. However, for those with ambivalent pre-existing feelings regarding their funerary traditions–such as many in the Samoan diaspora–COVID-19 restrictions afforded both a reprieve from burdensome practices and a much-welcomed opportunity to reimagine their traditions. Funerary restrictions, though disruptive, are thereby shown to have generative potential. © 2022 The Author(s).

Guided by a socio-ecological framework, an ethnography was conducted among newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM. Indepth interviews and participant observation were employed to produce an account of the social and cultural settings that was faithful to the perspectives of participants. A total of 31 participants with diverse backgrounds were recruited in a southern city of China. Participant observation was conducted in local healthcare settings, MSM venues, and NGO offices. Most participants (24/31) reported stopping unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) immediately after being diagnosed as HIV-positive. Factors associated with safer sex practices were identified at both individual and environmental levels, including self-protection, establishment of selfesteem, dignity, altruism and reciprocity, disease experience as a source of personal growth, and organizational culture and values. Newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM navigate their sexual practices within the context of multiple competing factors. Implications for sustained behaviour change enabling safer sex practices include stimulating survival instinct, facilitating safer sex decision making, motivating and facilitating personal growth, and encouraging volunteerism to promote intentional activities for safer sex practices. © 2017 The Author(s).","China;

However, despite its effectiveness, ART adherence still falls short globally, and non-adherence remains the primary cause of treatment failure. In the rural areas of southern Thailand, where the population is predominantly conservative Muslims, there has been an observed increase in ART non-adherence. Objective: This study aimed to explore experiences of inconsistent ART adherence among Thai-Muslim patients with HIV/AIDS (PWHAs) in southern Thailand. In addition, the perspectives of healthcare providers were also sought. Methods: Data were collected by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with ten Thai-Muslim PWHAs and five healthcare providers at a Voluntary Counseling-and-Testing Clinic. A content analysis approach was utilized to analyze the data. Results: Inconsistent ART adherence was reported. Religion/spiritual imperatives, forgetfulness, inadequate knowledge (of drug side effects and drug regime), misunderstandings (about being symptom-free and feeling well), boredom from long-term drug-taking regimes, as well as poor transportation and lack of family support (arising from non-disclosure of one’s HIV-serostatus due to HIV stigma) were emergent themes derived from the interviews with Thai-Muslim PWHAs. The healthcare providers’ interview data revealed their need for the integration of Islamic beliefs to provide better care. Conclusion: It is essential for healthcare teams to work collaboratively with patients’ religious beliefs to enhance ART adherence. Clinical nurses can contribute to the promotion of HIV-care services by integrating Islamic beliefs and Muslim culture into their practice, thus increasing patients' knowledge and motivation for ART adherence. This could entail utilizing Islamic prayer rituals as drug reminders, elaborating on Islamic moral beliefs concerning sickness and healing, and integrating the cultural imperatives of self-care in the Muslim community into ongoing care delivery. Cross-cultural nursing education and specialized training in HIV care should incorporate knowledge about Islamic and Muslim cultural beliefs. © The Author(s) 2023.","antiretroviral therapy; health personnel; HIV/AIDS; Islam; medication adherence","","","","","","Graduate School, Prince of Songkla University","This study was partially supported by the Graduate School, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand.","Afe A., Motunrayo O., Ogungbade G., Factors influencing adherence to HAART among patients living with HIV infection in southwest Nigeria: A cross-sectional analysis, Journal of HIV & Retro Virus, 3, (2017); Agnes Y., Songwathana P., Perngmark P., A grounded theory study of how Muslim wives adapt to their relationships with husbands who are HIV-positive, Pacific Rim International Journal of Nursing Research, 24, 2, pp. 187-201, (2020); Al Noumani H., Wu J.-R., Barksdale D., Knafl G., AlKhasawneh E., Sherwood G., Health beliefs and medication adherence in Omanis with hypertension, The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing, 33, 6, pp. 518-526, (2018); Badahdah A.

The aim of this study was to explore Chinese women's perceptions of maternal role competence and factors contributing to maternal role competence during early motherhood. Background. Developing a sense of competence and satisfaction in the maternal role are considered critical components in maternal adaptation, which have a significant impact on parenting behaviours and the psychosocial development of the child. However, qualitative studies that address maternal role competence are limited in the Chinese population. Design. This was an exploratory descriptive study. Method. A purposive sample of 26 Chinese primiparous mothers participated in a childbirth psychoeducation programme and was interviewed at sixweeks postpartum. Data were analysed using content analysis. Results. Women perceived a competent mother as being able to make a commitment to caring for the physical and emotional well-being of child, while cultivating appropriate values for childhood. Personal knowledge and experience of infant care, success in breastfeeding, infant's well-being, availability of social support and contradictory information from various sources were major factors affecting maternal role competency. Conclusion. The findings highlight the importance of understanding Chinese cultural attitudes to childrearing and maternal role competence. New Chinese mothers need information on child care, positive experiences of infant care, social support and consistent information to enhance their maternal role competency. Recommendations are made for Chinese culturally specific guidelines and healthcare delivery interventions to enhance maternal role competence in early motherhood. Relevance to clinical practice. Nursing and midwifery care should always take into account the cultural beliefs and enable adaptation of traditional postpartum practices. Providing consistent information and positive experience on parenting skills and infant behaviour as well as enhancing effective coping strategies could strengthen Chinese women's maternal role competency. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Chinese mothers;

AIM: To identify mothers' cultural understandings of the rationale for their CSs. METHODS: Design: A qualitative descriptive design was employed. Setting: A government hospital in the western region in Tanzania. Participants: A total of 117 mothers were interviewed using convenience sampling post CS. FINDINGS: Forty percent of the mothers were younger than 18 years, with more than 50% having had five or more live babies. Among multigravida women, 40.2% had had one or more previous CSs. The emergent themes were lack of dietary knowledge, use of local herbs, delays in coming to hospital, avoiding stressful labor pains and no ability to exercise, and no personal preferences of ""push or go for an operation."" CONCLUSION: Pregnant women in Tanzania need improved health education to make informed choices about childbirth and be involved all processes of antepartum care decision making to achieve optimal birth outcomes. © 2018 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.","Beliefs; Cesarean section; Misinformation; Mothers; Tanzania","","","","","","","","Aminu M., Utz B., Halim A., Van Den Broek N., BMC Pregnancy Childbirth, 1, (2014); Betran A., Torloni M., Zhang J., Gulmezoglu A., BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 5, (2016); Cavallaro F.L., Cresswell J.A., Ronsmans C., PLOS ONE, 3, (2016); Chen L.-W., Low Y.L., Fok D., Han W.M., Chong Y.S., Gluckman P., Soh S.E., Public Health Nutrition, 9, (2014); Chu K.-H., Tai C.-J., Hsu C.-S., Yeh M.-C., Chien L.-Y., BMC Health Services Research, 1, (2010); Creswell J.W., Clark V.L.P., Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research., (2007); Cuzzolin L., Francini-Pesenti F., Verlato G., Joppi M., Baldelli P., Benoni G., Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, 11, (2010); Faisal-Cury A., Menezes P.R., Revista de Saúde Pública, 2, (2006); Gibbons L., Belizan J.M., Lauer J.A., Betran A.P., Merialdi M., Althabe F., World Health Report, (2010); Groom K.M., Paterson-Brown S., Fisk N.M., European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, 2, (2002); Holroyd E., Lee Y., Pui-Yuk L.W., Kwok-Hong F.Y., Shuk-Lin B.L., Midwifery, 2, (1997); Holroyd E., Lopez V., Chan S.W.C., Nursing & Health Sciences, 1, (2011); Ji H., Jiang H., Yang L., Qian X., Tang S., BMJ Open, 11, (2015); Kamatenesi-Mugisha M., Oryem-Origa H., Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 1, (2007); Kamblijambi J.K., Holroyd E., Papua New Guinea midwives perspectives of the effect of a targeted village birth attendant education program, Midwifery, 52, pp. 11-18, (2017); Kruk M.E., Paczkowski M., Mbaruku G., De Pinho H., Galea S., American Journal of Public Health, 9, (2009); Lavender T., Hofmeyr G.J., Neilson J.P., Kingdon C., Gyte G.M., (2012); Lincenberg K.R., Behrman E.R., Bembry J.S., Kovac C.M., Uterine rupture with cesarean scar heterotopic pregnancy with survival of the intrauterine twin, Case Reports in Obstetrics and Gynecology, 2016, (2016); Mpogoro F.J., Mshana S.E., Mirambo M.M., Kidenya B.R., Gumodoka B., Imirzalioglu C., Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control, 1, (2014); Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2010, (2011); Ngomane S., Mulaudzi F.M., Midwifery, 1, (2012); Nilsen C., Ostbye T., Daltveit A.K., Mmbaga B.T., Sandoy I.F., International Journal for Equity in Health, 1, (2014); Noble H., Smith J., Issues of validity and reliability in qualitative research, Evidence-Based Nursing, 18, 2, pp. 34-35, (2015); Sandelowski M., Research in Nursing and Health, 4, (2000); Souza J.P., Gulmezoglu A.M., Carroli G., Lumbiganon P., Qureshi Z., BMC Health Services Research, 286, (2011); Souza J.P., Gulmezoglu A., Lumbiganon P., Laopaiboon M., Carroli G., Fawole B., Ruyan P., BMC Medicine, 1, (2010); Withers M., Kharazmi N., Lim E., Midwifery, (2018); Worjoloh A., Manongi R., Oneko O., Hoyo C., Daltveit A.K., Westreich D., Open Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 3, (2012); Wulandari L.P.L., Whelan A.K., Midwifery, 6, (2011)","V.A.

The wound clinical decision support system was built locally to support nurses to manage pressure ulcer wounds in their daily practice. However, its adoption rate is not optimal. The study's objective was to discover the concepts that informed the RNs' decisions to adopt the wound clinical decision support system as an evidencebased technology in their nursing practice. This was an exploratory, descriptive, and qualitative design using face-to-face interviews, individual interviews, and active participatory observation. A purposive, theoretical sample of 14 RNs was recruited from one of the largest public tertiary hospitals in Singapore after obtaining ethics approval. After consenting, the nurses were interviewed and observed separately. Recruitment stopped when data saturation was reached. All transcribed interview data underwent a concurrent thematic analysis, whereas observational data were content analyzed independently and subsequently triangulated with the interview data. Eight emerging themes were identified, namely, use of the wound clinical decision support system, beliefs in the wound clinical decision support system, influences of the workplace culture, extent of the benefits, professional control over nursing practices, use of knowledge, gut feelings, and emotions (fear, doubt, and frustration). These themes represented the nurses' mental outlook as they made decisions on adopting the wound clinical decision support system in light of the complexities of their roles and workloads. This research has provided insight on the nurses' thoughts regarding their decision to interact with the computer environment in a Singapore context. It captured the nurses' complex thoughts when deciding whether to adopt or reject information technology as they practice in a clinical setting. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

While New Zealand Police played a fundamental role in enforcing pandemic control measures, the policing landscape remained plural. This article employs Loader [2000. Plural policing and democratic governance. Social and legal studies, 9 (3), 323–345] model of plural policing to understand responses to public health emergencies. It identifies two forms of policing which were evident in Aotearoa during the COVID-19 lockdown that should be added to Loader’s model. First, we argue that contexts with colonial history require that the model not only includes by-government and below-government policing but also next-to-government policing by Indigenous peoples–such as the ‘community checkpoints’ run by Māori. Second, and further developing Loader’s model, we argue that the category of below-government policing be expanded to include ‘peer-to-peer policing’ in which government responsibilizes members of the public to subject each other to large-scale surveillance and social control. Since plural forms of policing affect each other’s functionality and legitimacy, we argue that what happens at the synapses between policing nodes has profound implications for the process of community building. Because community building is essential to fighting pandemics, we conclude that the policing of pandemic intervention measures may require an expanded understanding and practice of plural policing to support an optimal public health strategy. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; Indigenous rights; next-to-government policing; plural policing","","","","","","Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT","This work was supported by Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand.","Alves V., (2020); Anderson E., Burris E., Policing and public health: not quite the right analogy, Policing and society, 27, 3, pp. 300-313, (2016); Ardern J., (2020); Barnes A., Et al., Anti-Maori themes in New Zealand journalism: toward alternative practice, Pacific journalism review, 18, 1, pp. 195-216, (2012); Bayley D., Shearing C., The future of policing, Law and society review, 30, 3, pp. 585-606, (1996); Bayley D., Shearing C., The new structure of policing: description, conceptualisation, and research, (2001); Biddle D.-L., (2020); (2020); Blagg H., Anthony T., ‘If those old women catch you, you’re going to cop it’: night patrols, Indigenous women, and place based sovereignty in outback Australia, African journal of criminology and justice studies, 8, pp. 103-124, (2014); Boels D., Verhage A., Plural policing: a state-of-the-art review, Policing: an international journal, 39, 1, pp. 1-17, (2015); Bradley T., Governing private security in New Zealand, Australian and New Zealand journal of criminology, 49, 2, pp. 159-178, (2014); Bradley T., The pluralisation of policing, The Palgrave handbook of criminology, crime and justice, pp. 497-510, (2017); Bradley T., Sedgwick C., Policing beyond the police: a ‘first cut’ study of private security in New Zealand, Policing & society, 19, 4, pp. 468-492, (2009); Brandon V., Simranjit K., Howard E., Gossip as social control: informal sanctions on ethical violations in scientific workplaces, Social problems, 63, 4, pp. 554-572, (2016); Brewin M., Coggan C., Evaluation of the Ngati Porou community injury prevention project, Ethnicity and health, 9, 1, pp. 5-15, (2004); Bull S., The land of murder, cannibalism, and all kinds of atrocious crimes?’ Maori and crime in New Zealand, 1853-1919, British journal of criminology, 44, 4, pp. 496-519, (2004); Bushway S., Forst B., Discretion in the criminal justice system, (2011); Cole A., Knowles J., Lives in context: the art of life history research, (2001); (2020); Crawford A., The pattern of policing in the UK: policing beyond the police, Handbook of policing, pp. 147-181, (2008); Crawford A., The police, policing and the future of the ‘extended policing family, The future of policing, pp. 173-190, (2013); Cunneen C., Tauri M., Indigenous criminology, (2016); Deguera B., (2020); Dupont B., Grabosky P., Shearing C., The governance of security in weak and failing states, Crime and security, pp. 481-499, (2016); Fabio A., Et al., Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and the shape of the age-crime curve, American journal of public health, 101, 1, pp. 325-332, (2011); Forbes M., (2020); Fresne K., (2020); Frieden T., Six components necessary for effective public health program implementation, American journal of public health, 104, 1, pp. 17-22, (2014); Gibbs G.R., Analysing qualitative data, (2018); Gregory A., Et al., Reading news about Maori: responses from non-Maori media audiences, Alternative: an international journal of indigenous peoples, 7, 1, pp. 51-64, (2011); Hall K., Et al., Ethics and equity in the time of coronavirus, Journal of primary health care, 12, 2, pp. 102-106, (2020); Hill R., Maori and the state: Crown–Maori relations in New Zealand/Aotearoa, 1950–2000, (2010); Hoogenboom B., Grey policing: a theoretical framework, Policing and society, 2, 1, pp. 17-30, (1991); Houkamau C., Sibley C., The role of culture and identity for economic values: a quantitative study of Māori attitudes, Journal of the royal society of New Zealand, 49, S1, pp. 119-136, (2019); Ibrahim N., Everyday authoritarianism: a political anthropology of Singapore, Critical asian studies, 50, 2, pp. 219-231, (2018); Jackson M., Māori and the criminal justice system: He whaipaanga hou, (1988); Jackson M., (2016); Johnston L., From ‘pluralisation’ to ‘the police extended family’: discourses on the governance of community policing in Britain”, International journal of the sociology of law, 31, 3, pp. 185-204, (2003); Jones T., Newburn T., Learning from uncle Sam?

This article examines their moral decision-making and affective experiences of lockdown, especially when faced with competing responsibilities to adhere to public health regulations, but also to care for themselves or provide support to people outside their bubbles. Our respondents engaged in independent risk assessment, weighing up how best to uphold the ‘spirit’ of the lockdown even when contravening lockdown regulations; their decisions could, however, lead to acute social rifts. Some respondents–such as those in flatshares and shared childcare arrangements–recounted feeling disempowered from participating in the collective management of risk and responsibility within their bubbles, while essential workers found that anxieties about their workplace exposure to the coronavirus could prevent them from expanding their bubbles in ways they might have liked. The inability to adequately care for oneself or for others thus emerges as a crucial axis of disadvantage, specific to times of lockdown.

Background: There have been limited studies to date on the association between sexual activity and substance use in Chinese high schools. While the role of the school nurse in the development of sexual health and harm reduction education in secondary schools has been well documented in international studies, this has received little attention in Asia. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: This study was administered in 2003/2004 to 13,895 Grades 6 to 12 high school students in Hong Kong (3498), Macau (6286) and Taipei (4111). Descriptive analysis was conducted followed by univariate analysis comparing sexual behaviour with (1) substance use including alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs; (2) feeling depressed for greater than or equal to two weeks in last 12 months; contemplating suicide during the last 12 months; and (3) perception of poor health/academic performance. Results: The students (8%) reported being sexually active had marked differences in selected health outcomes when compared with the nonsexually experienced students. More than 90% of the sexually active students had tried alcohol, with more than 50% being regular drinkers, more than 30% testifying to binge drinking and nearly 50% reported depression in the past 12 months. Substance use, poorer perception of health and academic performance were also significantly higher in the sexually experienced students relative to their nonexperienced counterparts. Conclusions: Sexually experienced Chinese high school students surveyed were at higher risk of substance abuse, poorer psychological health and academic performance. Relevance to clinical practice: Community and public health nursing needs to address Asian adolescent sexual health education needs, in particular provide culturally targeted interventions for associated substance abuse and psychological health within the context of high school sex education. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Adolescent health; Community nursing; Health education; Mental health; Sexual health; Substance abuse","Adolescent; Adult; Child; China; Ethnic Groups; Humans; Male; Risk-Taking; Sexual Behavior; Students; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; child; China; ethnic group; ethnology; high risk behavior; human; male; psychology; sexual behavior; student; young adult","","","","","","","Aderson J.E., Mueller T.E., Trends in sexual risk behavior and unprotected sex among high school students, 1991-2005: the role of substance use, Journal of School Health, 78, pp. 575-580, (2008); Brislin R., Landis D., Brandt M.E., Conceptualizations of intercultural behavior and training, Handbook of Intercultural Training, 1, pp. 1-35, (1983); Brook J.S., Cohen P., Brook D.W., Longitudinal study of co-occurring psychiatric disorders and substance use, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 37, pp. 322-330, (1998); Brook J.S., Adams R.E., Balka E.B., Whiteman M., Zhang C., Sugerman R., Illicit drug use and risky sexual behavior among African American and Puerto Rican urban adolescents: the longitudinal links, Journal of Genetic Psychology, 165, pp. 203-220, (2004); Cook R.L., Clark D.B., Is there an association between alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted diseases?

Little is known about what this population perceives would reduce their loneliness. This study aimed to investigate the role of co-design in the development of community-based resources/services for ameliorating the loneliness of Chinese late-life immigrants. Eight co-researchers completed three co-design workshops, and two key service providers were consulted. Co-researchers co-designed guidebooks on accessing primary healthcare facilities, social services, aged care facilities, and public transport, which were considered helpful for ameliorating loneliness. Co-housing was co-designed as a concept and regarded as a feasible way of living to strengthen social interactions and reduce loneliness. Providing more public social housing, adding ‘next-bus stop’ announcements, and conducting loneliness screening were recommended at the national level. Our findings affirmed the need to truly listen to the voices of both service end-users and service providers. © The Author(s) 2023.","Chinese; co-design; loneliness; older immigrants; participatory methods","","","","","","Age Concern Auckland; Faculty of Health and Social Sciences; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1: This manuscript analyzed part of the data from the first author’s PhD thesis which was supervised by other co-authors.

This paper explored the factors that contribute to the inequity in health services utilisation experienced by these migrants; and, identified the elements that could constitute an effective health delivery model to address the service gap. Methods: Site visits and a focus group discussion (n = 13) were held with both public and private health providers before a number of innovative health delivery models were formulated. They were then circulated among the panel in two further rounds of Delphi survey (n = 11) from March-April 2012 to systematically collect opinions and select the most endorsed health service models to serve this target population. Results: Focus group members perceived that most migrants were unaware of, or even ignored, their own physical and mental health needs, and had low utilisation of healthcare services, because of their pre-occupation with daily chores and hardship as well as differing health values, practices and expectations. They further identified that the structural issues such as the healthcare setting or the operation of current service provisions had failed to meet migrants health needs. Consequently, four new service models that incorporated professional advice and empowerment, which were identified as the two most important elements, were put forward. Thus, the model of having a nurse with social work training, supported by volunteer groups, was selected as the best option to familiarise and empower patients within the labyrinth of local healthcare services. Conclusion: Implementation of a social empowerment model by way of targeted support and specific health information is recommended. Further evaluation of this model is needed to understand its effectiveness for improving health literacy and health status in this disadvantaged group in the long term. © 2014 Wong et al.","Access to health care; Delphi technique; Health Policy; Healthcare delivery; Migrants","China; Delivery of Health Care; Delphi Technique; Emigrants and Immigrants; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Hong Kong; Humans; Models, Organizational; Power (Psychology); China; Hong Kong; Delphi analysis; empowerment; health policy; health services; literacy; mental health; migrant worker; questionnaire survey; service quality; social work; spatiotemporal analysis; training; Article; community integration; daily life activity; Delphi study; education program; empowerment; expectation; female; health behavior; health care delivery; health care disparity; health care management; health care need; health care quality; health care utilization; health practitioner; Hong Kong; human; migrant; nurse; physical parameters; population research; priority journal; public health service; social work; statistical model; behavior; China; ethnology; health care delivery; health care disparity; information processing; nonbiological model; organization and management","","","","","","","Kawachi I., Subramanian S.V., Almeida-Filho N., A glossary for health inequalities, J Epidemiol Community Health, 56, pp. 647-652, (2002); Bollini P., Siem H., No real progress towards equity: Health of migrants and ethnic minorities on the Eve of the year 2000, Soc Sci Med, 41, pp. 819-828, (1995); Murray S.B., Skull S.A., Hurdles to health: Immigrant and refugee health care in Australia, Aust Health Rev, 29, pp. 25-29, (2005); Castaeda X., Ruelas M.R., Felt E., Schenker M., Health of migrants: Working towards a better future, Infect Dis Clin North Am, 25, pp. 421-433, (2011); Lai D.W.L., Chau S.B.Y., Predictors of health service barriers for older Chinese immigrants in Canada, Health Soc Work, 32, pp. 57-65, (2007); Li X., Stanton B., Fang X., Lin D., Social stigma and mental health among rural-to-urban migrants in China: A conceptual framework and future research needs, World Health Popul, 8, pp. 14-31, (2006); Hu X., Cook S., Salazar M.A., Internal migration and health in China, Lancet, 372, pp. 1717-1719, (2008); Llcer A., Zunzunegui M.V., Del Amo J., Mazarrasa L., Bolumar F., The contribution of a gender perspective to the understanding of migrants?, Health.

This creates a tenuous setting for African ASRs there. This study explored how mapped social determinates of health has impacted the mental health and wellbeing of African ASR's in Hong Kong. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 374 African ASRs. The survey comprised of: (a) socio-demographics; (b) health status; (c) health behaviours; and, (d) social experiences. Associations between social determinants of health and depression screen were explored and multivariable regression analysis was conducted. Results: Majority of participants were 18-37 years old (79.7%), male (77.2%), single (66.4%) and educated (60.9% high school and above). Over a third (36.1%) screened positive for depression. Analyses revealed that living with family reduced the odds of a positive depression screen (OR = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.07-0.88). Those perceiving their health to be ""Poor"" were 5.78 times as likely to be screened for depression. Additionally, those with higher scores on the discrimination scale were more likely to have positive depression screen (OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.10-1.24). Conclusion: A significant proportion of African ASRs in Hong Kong exhibits depressive symptoms. A complex interaction combining both social and perceptions of health and discrimination in the host society is likely exacerbated by their ASR status. The use of community support groups or even re-examination of the family reunification laws could improve the mental health and wellbeing of African ASRs in Hong Kong. © 2017 The Author(s).","African refugees; Depression; Hong Kong; Mental health; Social Determinants of Health","Adolescent; Adult; Africa; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder; Female; Health Behavior; Health Status; Health Surveys; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Refugees; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; Africa; cross-sectional study; Depressive Disorder; ethnology; female; health behavior; health status; health survey; Hong Kong; human; male; middle aged; psychology; refugee; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; young adult","","","","","AIDs Trust Funds, (MSS 200R)","We would like to acknowledge that this work was supported and funded by The AIDs Trust Funds [MSS 200R].","Edwards A., Dobbs L.R., Global forced displacement tops 50 million for first time in post-World War II era [press release, Geneva: UNHCR News, (2014); Shum T., Refugee protection and spaces: Seeking asylum in Hong Kong, Oxford Monitor Forced Migr, 1, 2, pp. 17-20, (2011); Church T.V., Asylum Seekers in Hong Kong Hong Kong 2013; State Parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees And/or Its 1967 Protocol, (2014); Po W., Situation of mandated refugees, asylum seekers and torture claimants in Hong Kong, Services, (2014); The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and Its 1967 Protocol, (2011); Timeline on UNHCR and the Development of Refugee Protection in Hong Kong Yau Ma Tei; Man.

Background: Older immigrants’ well-being is closely associated with filial relations and is often reliant on families as a main source of social, financial and emotional support. Research among migrant Asian adults has reported mixed findings regarding intergenerational perspectives of filial practices. Design: Qualitative design using focused ethnographic lens. Methods: Semi-structured individual interviews were undertaken with 45 adult children of older immigrants living in New Zealand to explore their views about filial piety. The CoREQ checklist was used in reporting methods and findings. Results: Two major themes were identified in this study of adult children's view of filial piety and late-life care for their ageing parents. The first theme, ‘holding on—reconfiguring values’, referred to a process described by the participants as upholding the core values and cultural familial expectations, looking after their ageing parents, yet modifying the ways in which they provide care. The second major theme ‘letting go—reconfigured expectations’, described participants’ views of aged care for themselves, which meant they no longer held traditional values that needed to be enacted by their children. Conclusions: Adult children from immigrant families were positioned as intermediaries of these shifting values of their own and within younger generations. The adult children's shift of thinking and acceptance of reconfigured expression of filial duties impact care and living arrangements of older people from immigrant and culturally diverse backgrounds, which also influences health and well-being in later life. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare professionals including nurses working in the ageing and aged care sector need to accommodate the changing generational perspectives about filial piety to cater to the unique late-life care requirements and health needs of older people and their families. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","aged care; Asian; culturally diverse; filial piety; late-life care; New Zealand","adult; adult child; aging; article; checklist; child; clinical article; clinical practice; controlled study; expectation; female; human; human experiment; immigrant; interview; male; New Zealand; nurse; thinking; wellbeing","","","","","","","Abalos J.B., Saito Y., Cruz G.T., Booth H., Who cares?

In particular, highlighted are their associated personal, social, relational and cultural vulnerabilities. A purposeful sample of 13 pairs of HIV-born adolescents between the ages of 11–19 years and their primary caregivers were recruited in December 2014. The Conceptual Model Sexual Health Disclosure (CMSHD) was modified with Chinese culturally specific adaptation to guide the exploration of the complex aspects of the adolescents and caregiver’s relationships. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and then translated into English. Complex sociocultural interactions emerging in these dyadic interviews included guilt, shame, unintended disclosure, the need for secrecy, perceived stigma, ‘loss of face’, protection of parents, inability to support their families and deep concerns over lineage and future marriage prospects amongst the parents, which had significant psychosocial and even physical impacts for these adolescents born with HIV and their families. Frontline health-care workers and HIV peer support programs are recommended to counteract China’s current top-down biomedical disease-related approach to health services. It is crucial to provide instrumental avenues of confidential psychosocial support including disclosure approaches for caregivers of HIV positive adolescents within a uniquely Chinese cultural context. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; culture; disclosure; HIV; parent–child relationship; stigma","","","","","","","","Aderomilehin O., Hanciles-Amu A., Ozoya O.O., Perspectives and practice of HIV disclosure to children and adolescents by health-care providers and caregivers in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review, Front Public Health, 4, (2016); Bergin M., NVivo 8 and consistency in data analysis: Reflecting on the use of a qualitative data analysis program, Nurse Research Journal, 18, 3, pp. 6-12, (2011); Brashers D.E., Basinger E.D., Rintamaki L.S., Caughlin J.P., Para M., Taking control: The efficacy and durability of a peer-led uncertainty management intervention for people recently diagnosed with HIV, Health Communication, 32, 1, (2016); China N.H., 2015 China AIDS Response Progress Report, (2015); Duffy L., Suffering, shame, and silence: The stigma of HIV/AIDS, Journal of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care, 16, 1, pp. 13-20, (2005); Fernet M., Wong K., Richard M.E., Otis J., Levy J.J., Lapointe N., Trottier G., Romantic relationships and sexual activities of the first generation of youth living with HIV since birth, AIDS Care, 23, 4, pp. 393-400, (2011); Fusch P.I., Ness L.R., Are we there yet?

Background: Hospitality centres on a host offering comfort to others, as in a personal care context. Caring constitutes the essence of what it is to be human, having a profound effect on well-being and recovery from surgery. Caring is one of the most elusive and diversely contested concepts in nursing; however, care provided by nurses seldom transcends as deep human connections and social utility. This study explored the nature, meaning and experience of hospitality as care from the perspective of elective surgery patients. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative criteria were used. Design: A hermeneutic phenomenological methodology. Methods: Data were gathered through semi-structured, face to face interviews with seven patients from both private and public hospitals, and from different cultural backgrounds. Results: Three interpretative notions were as follows: experiences of hospitality as feeling “really” cared for, being at ease and being healed. Hospitality exists in the receiver's lived experience, evoking a special moment which leads to feelings of great comfort and feelings of being truly cared about. When hospitality is received, patients feel a connection; they begin to trust and their healing begins. Conclusion: The offering of often small, yet heartfelt acts of hospitality, indicated that nurses can evoke powerful lived experiences which benefit patients undergoing elective surgery. Relevance to clinical practice: The importance of prioritising emotional and social connections to the hospitality experience needs emphasis at all levels of the clinical structure. Hospitality as caring needs to form a part of all undergraduate and postgraduate nursing curricula, and ongoing professional development. The participant quotes presented in this article could form exemplars for the provision of hospitable nursing care practices, highlighting nurses getting to know and understand their patients, and being interested in their lives. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","caring;

The 8-week DSEEP consisted of a guidebook on diabetes self-care, a 1-day workshop, and fortnightly follow-up telephone calls. In total, 113 participants (56 in intervention group and 57 in control group) completed the study. Data were collected at baseline and at 8 weeks from the baseline. Outcome measures included self-efficacy, diabetes self-care activities, health-related quality of life, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and unplanned health care service usage. Compared with participants in the control group, those who received DSEEP had significantly higher increase in self-efficacy and diabetes self-care activities, lower HbA1c, and lesser unplanned health service usage. However, there was no significant difference in health-related quality of life between the two groups. The DSEEP increased self-efficacy, which successfully enhanced self-care activities and reduced HbA1c. © The Author(s) 2018.","chronic illness; clinical effectiveness; nursing; older adults; self-efficacy; type 2 diabetes","Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Quality of Life; Self Care; Self Efficacy; glycosylated hemoglobin; aged; controlled study; human; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; self care; self concept","","glycosylated hemoglobin, 9062-63-9; Glycated Hemoglobin A, ","","","Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Welfare Foundation, MSIWF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Welfare Foundation Research Grant for Senior Citizen Welfare.","Abdelhafiz A.H., Bailey C., Loo B.E., Sinclair A., Hypoglycemic symptoms and hypoglycemia threshold in older people with diabetes—a patient perspective, Journal of Nutrition Health & Aging, 17, pp. 899-902, (2013); Abdelhafiz A.H., Sinclair A.J., Epidemiology, aetiology, pathogenesis and management of diabetes in older people, Advanced nutrition and dietetics in diabetes, pp. 207-217, (2015); Amiel S.A., Dixon T., Mann R., Jameson K., Hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, Diabetes Medicine, 25, pp. 245-254, (2008); Ang Y., Yap C.W., Saxena N., Lin L.-K., Heng B.H., Diabetes-related lower extremity amputations in Singapore, Proceedings of Singapore Healthcare, 26, pp. 76-80, (2016); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, (1997); Bandura A., Health promotion from the perspective of social cognition theory, Understanding and changing health behaviour: From health beliefs to self-regulation, pp. 299-339, (2000); Bean D., Cundy T., Petrie K.J., Ethnic differences in illness perceptions, self-efficacy and diabetes self-care, Psychology & Health, 22, pp. 787-811, (2007); Beckerle C.M., Lavin M.A., Association of self-efficacy and self-care with glycemic control in diabetes, Diabetes Spectrum, 26, pp. 172-178, (2013); Bell R.A., Andrews J.S., Arcury T.A., Snively B.M., Golden S.L., Qiandt S.A., Depressive symptoms and diabetes self-management among rural older adults, American Journal of Health Behavior, 34, 1, pp. 36-44, (2010); Berg G.D., Wadhwa S., Health services outcomes for a diabetes disease management program for the elderly, Disease Management, 10, pp. 226-234, (2007); Gao J.J., Wang J., Zheng P., Haardorfer R., Kegler M.C., Zhu Y., Fu H., Effects of self-care, self-efficacy, social support on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, BMC Family Practice, 14, (2013); Gates B.J., Walker K.M., Physiological changes in older adults and their effect on diabetes treatment, Diabetes Spectrum, 27, 1, pp. 20-29, (2014); Ha M., Hu J., Petrini M.A., McCoy T.P., The Effects of an educational self-efficacy intervention on osteoporosis prevention and diabetes self-management among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Biological Research for Nursing, 16, pp. 357-367, (2014); Hawkins S.Y., Improving glycemic control in older adults using a videophone motivational diabetes self-management intervention, Research and Theory for Nursing Practice, 24, pp. 217-232, (2010); Hernandez R., Ruggiero L., Prohaska T.R., Chavez N., Boughton S.W., Peacock N., Nouwen A., A cross-sectional study of depressive symptoms and diabetes self-care in African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos with diabetes.

However, the vasectomy uptake remains low in Africa and birth rates remain high, particularly in rural areas. In Tanzania, family planning education and service delivery are currently women-centred. Vasectomies to date have not been positively perceived in African societies including urban Tanzania, owing to the adherence to strong patriarchal belief systems and the social role of men. This study aimed to explore rural men's perceptions and beliefs regarding barriers to vasectomy uptake. Significant barriers to vasectomy uptake were the lack of knowledge, expectations around men's gendered role, religious beliefs, and social stigma. The participants were 51 purposively selected married men aged 35 to 61 years. Four focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were conducted. Five main themes were extracted, namely men as the kings of their families; multiple sources of knowledge causing confusion; gender roles in family planning; cultural and religious beliefs; and stigma related to failure to produce children after vasectomy. Overall, men expressed the view that vasectomy was a challenge to their role as ""king of their family"". Engaging in targeted media releases, using community billboards, and providing grassroots-based health education delivered by male ""elimisha rika""(peer educators) at community level are recommended as awareness raising strategies in communities. © Unisa Press 2019.","Barriers; Beliefs; Men; Tanzania; Vasectomy","adult; article; awareness; child; controlled study; expectation; family planning; female; health care delivery; health education; human; human experiment; interview; major clinical study; male; married man; perception; religion; sex role; social stigma; Tanzania; vasectomy","","","","","","","Akindele R.

Background: Loneliness causes adverse health consequences in Chinese late-life immigrants leading to increased utilisation of often increasingly limited healthcare resources. However, little is known about how Chinese late-life immigrants perceive and experience loneliness and social isolation in their host countries. Design: An integrative review methodology. Methods: Using a systematic search strategy, Google scholar and databases, such as Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, CHNAHL, Medline and open access Theses were searched. No limitation was placed on publication date. Peer-reviewed studies published from the database inception to May 6, 2021 in the English language were included. The review process is reported according to PRISMA. Results: Eight articles met the criteria and were included in this review. Two themes resulting from the data synthesis process were identified. Firstly, ‘disrupted social relations after late-life immigration’ and secondly ‘moving away from filial expectations’. Conclusion: Loneliness and social isolation are commonly experienced by Chinese late-life immigrants when residing in host countries. Understanding and identification of the sources of loneliness and social isolation among late-life immigrants are essential prompts for healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, to engage sensitively with Chinese late-life immigrants. Nurses culturally relevant care delivery in a variety of settings may best serve recipients’ social and health related needs. Relevance to clinical practice: This integrated review informs the planning of health and social services for addressing Chinese late-life immigrants’ experiences of loneliness and social isolation. Focused attention on cultural responsiveness is an important component of providing quality and safe nursing care. This review of the recent evidence on socially-rooted health concerns affected by both immigration and ageing will help advance nursing practice in providing culturally responsive care interventions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Chinese; gerontology; immigrants; late life; loneliness; social isolation","Asian People; East Asian People; Emigrants and Immigrants; Humans; Loneliness; Social Isolation; Asian; East Asian; human; loneliness; migrant; social isolation","","","","","","","Loneliness, (2021); Caidi N., Du J.T., Li L., Shen J.M., Sun Q.L., Immigrating after 60: Information experiences of older Chinese migrants to Australia and Canada, Information Processing & Management, 57, 3, (2020); Critical appraisal skills programme CASP qualitative research checklist, (2018); Da W.-W., Garcia A., Later life migration: Sociocultural adaptation and changes in quality of life at settlement among recent older Chinese immigrants in Canada, Activities, Adaptation & Aging, 39, 3, pp. 214-242, (2015); Dong X., Chang E.S., Wong E., Simon M., Perception and negative effect of loneliness in a Chicago Chinese population of older adults, Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics, 54, 1, pp. 151-159, (2012); Fokkema T., De Jong Gierveld J., Dykstra P.A., Cross-national differences in older adult loneliness, Journal of Psychology, 146, 1-2, pp. 201-228, (2012); World Migration Report (WMR) 2020, (2020); Johnson S., Bacsu J., Mclntosh T., Jeffery B., Novik N., Social isolation and loneliness among immigrant and refugee seniors in Canada: A scoping review, International Journal of Migration, Health and Social Care, 15, 3, pp. 177-190, (2019); Li W.W., Art in health and identity: Visual narratives of older Chinese immigrants to New Zealand, Arts & Health, 4, 2, pp. 109-123, (2012); Li W.W., Chong M.D., Transnationalism, social wellbeing and older Chinese migrants, Graduate Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies, 8, 1, pp. 29-44, (2012); Li W.W., Hodgetts D., Ho E., Gardens, transitions and identity reconstruction among older Chinese immigrants to New Zealand, J Health Psychol, 15, 5, pp. 786-796, (2010); Lin X., Bryant C., Boldero J., Dow B., Psychological well-being of older Chinese immigrants living in Australia: A comparison with older Caucasians, International Psychogeriatrics, 28, 10, pp. 1671-1679, (2016); McCormack B., McCance T.V., Development of a framework for person-centred nursing, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 56, pp. 472-479, (2006); Moher D., Liberati A., Tetzlaff J., Altman D.G., Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: The PRISMA Statement, PLoS Med, 6, 7, (2009); Montayre J., Neville S., Dunn I., Shrestha-Ranjit J., Taylor L., Wright-St Clair V.A., What makes community-based physical activity programs for culturally and linguistically diverse older adults effective?

Their discontent is mostly related to their midwives’ disrespectful or negative attitudes. Objective: To explore women's experiences and perceptions of disrespect and abuse from their maternity care providers in a low resource rural setting in Zimbabwe. Design: A critical, qualitative research methodology, using in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions, was employed to capture rural women's experiences during antenatal care, postpartum care, and the use of maternity waiting homes’ services. Setting: Three rural health centres in Mutare district, Manicaland Province in eastern Zimbabwe. Participants: A total of 20 purposively sampled women, 16–30 years of age, who were accessing various stages of maternal health services, were recruited from three conveniently selected rural health centres. Eight women participated in the in-depth interviews. A further eight women were discussants in the first focus group, and a further four women participated in the second focus group. Findings: Multifaceted and interconnected factors contribute to midwives’ attitudes and behaviours towards their clients. Midwives’ subjective perceptions, women's social status, and health system constraints (i.e., availability of trained midwives and quality of midwifery training) in rural and poorly resourced community, often result in inappropriate services, negative attitudes, abusive treatment, and disrespectful behaviour towards women. Poor treatment in maternity care directly contribute to adverse health outcomes and women's satisfaction with services. Conclusion and implications for practice: Women's social status, level of education and age, were perceived to influence the quality of care or treatment they received. Improving women's experience of maternal care requires targeted interventions at the interpersonal level between a woman and her health care providers, as well as at the level of the health care facility and the health system. The results of this study challenge all tiers of health personnel including policy makers, in low resource settings to reappraise the present situation thereby challenging these established behaviours, to ensure that the continuum of maternity care is respectfully and socio-culturally delivered. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Abuse; Disrespect; Low resource settings; Maternal care services; Quality of care; Rights","Adolescent; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Maternal Health Services; Patient Satisfaction; Perception; Professional-Patient Relations; Qualitative Research; Quality of Health Care; Respect; Rural Population; Zimbabwe; adolescent; adult; adverse outcome; article; clinical article; controlled study; disrespect; education; female; health care facility; human; human experiment; human tissue; interview; maternal care; maternal health service; midwife; outcome assessment; perception; prenatal care; puerperium; qualitative research; rural health care; satisfaction; social status; Zimbabwe; health care quality; health personnel attitude; information processing; patient satisfaction; procedures; professional-patient relationship; rural population; Zimbabwe","","","","","Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT","This work was supported by the New Zealand Scholarship programme and the Auckland University of Technology .

In order to explore potential socioecological factors associated with mental health problems among newly diagnosed HIV-infected migrant men who have sex with men (MSM), we employed a life profile approach conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with 31 newly diagnosed HIV-infected MSM residing in a city in Southern China. Participants' life profile accounts outlined their concerns, including internalized stigma, subsistence living, difficulties finding a lover or a stable partner, loss of face, and deviation from filial piety. We contend that targeted interventions should address socio-ecological issues such as migrant adversities, social suffering, and cultural trauma when providing culturally based mental health services for this marginalized population within the context of Chinese society. © 2015 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care.","China; HIV; Men who have sex with men; Mental health; Newly diagnosed HIV infection","Adolescent; Adult; China; Family Relations; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Mental Health; Prejudice; Qualitative Research; Self Concept; Sexual Partners; Social Stigma; Social Support; Stereotyping; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; attitude to health; China; ethnology; family relation; HIV Infections; human; information processing; interview; male; male homosexuality; mental health; prejudice; psychology; qualitative research; self concept; sexuality; social stigma; social support; stereotyping; young adult","","","","","Center for Health Behaviors Research of the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (R01AI114310); Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK, (2010-11)","This research was funded by the Center for Health Behaviors Research of the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care (JCSPHPC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), a postgraduate study grant in JCSPHPC , and the Global Scholarship Programme for Research Excellence–CNOOC Grants 2010-11 in CUHK.

There is a paucity of studies that synthesise the experiences and realities of migrants, refugees and healthcare providers that hinder access to healthcare and provide recommendations to improve services. This review synthesised these barriers and recommendations, with an aim to improve equitable access to healthcare to migrants and refugees. An integrative review of 13 peer-reviewed research studies from EBSCOhost research databases published between January 2016 and September 2022. Studies included: (i) related to Aotearoa; (ii) had a focus on equitable delivery of healthcare to migrants and refugees; and (iii) had a full English text available. The PRISMA framework guided the reporting of the review. The findings were thematically analysed and presented using a narrative empirical synthesis. The findings were organised into three broad themes: attitudinal barriers, structural barriers, and recommendations. Attitudinal barriers included the lack of culturally competent healthcare providers, discrimination by healthcare providers, and personal, social, and cultural attributes. Structural barriers referred to policies and frameworks that regulated the accessibility of health services such as the cost of healthcare, accessibility and acceptability of interpreter services, length of allocated appointments and long waiting times for an appointment, difficulties navigating the health system, and logistical barriers. Recommendations focused on promoting a sense of belonging, enabling a whole-of-society approach that brings together all sectors involved in providing health care for collective impact, and advocating for government policies to create a system that addresses the core health service access needs. This review provides rich context-specific findings on the barriers to equitable access to healthcare and proposed interventions to enhance equitable health outcomes for migrants and refugees in Aotearoa. The review contributes to relevant policy decisions and has practical implications to build responsive health systems which are inclusive, equitable and best address the health needs of populations from diverse cultural backgrounds. © 2023, The Author(s).","Access; Aotearoa New Zealand; Barriers; Equity; Healthcare; Migrants; Refugees; Review","Health Personnel; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; New Zealand; Qualitative Research; Refugees; Transients and Migrants; cultural background; government; health care cost; health care delivery; health care personnel; human; interpreter service; migrant; narrative; New Zealand; refugee; review; synthesis; transcultural care; health care access; migration; New Zealand; qualitative research","","","","","School of Public Health and Interdisciplinary Studies at the Auckland University of Technology; Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT","Funding text 1: Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

An unstructured interview guide was used to conduct 15 one-to-one audio-taped interviews in the field. Results revealed that although Swazi women embraced modern biomedical practices, they also largely adhered to customary practices, including use of traditional model of causation of illness, and the use of traditional medicines during childbirth. Recommendations include parallel antenatal education, which gives credence to the customs within the context of scientific modernity. In addition, changes are needed to public health policy that allows parallel systems of care to be delivered within the context of community midwifery practice. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Beliefs; Childbirth practices; Midwifery; Swaziland; Values","Anthropology, Cultural; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Maternal Health Services; Medicine, Traditional; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Rural Population; Swaziland; article; cultural anthropology; female; health service; human; interview; organization and management; pregnancy; retrospective study; rural population; Swaziland; traditional medicine","","","","","","","Barclay L., Women and midwives: Position, problems and potential, Midwifery, 24, pp. 330-340, (2006); Pairman S., McAra-Couper J., Midwifery; Preparation for Practice, Theoretical frameworks for midwifery practice, pp. 237-257, (2006); Schim S.M., Doorenbos A., and Benkert R., Miller J., Culturally congruent care: Putting the puzzle together, Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 18, pp. 103-110, (2007); Braithwaite A.C., Williams C.C., Childbirth experiences of professional Chinese Canadian women, Journal of Obstetric Gynaecological and Neonatal Nursing, 33, pp. 748-755, (2004); Bharj K.K., Cooper M.A., Myles' Textbook for Midwives, The social context of childbirth and motherhood, pp. 21-36, (2009); Maher P., A review of 'traditional' Aboriginal health beliefs, Australian Journal of Rural Health, 7, pp. 299-236, (1999); Jones L.K., (2004); Sukhdev K., Bhagat R., Balneaves L.G., Perinatal beliefs and practices of immigrant Punjabi women living in Canada, Journal of Obstetric, Gynaecologic, and Neonatal Nursing, 37, pp. 290-300, (2008); Noble A., Rom M., Newsome-Wicks M., Woloski-Wruble A., Jewish laws, customs, and practice in labour, delivery, and postpartum care, Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 20, pp. 323-333, (2009); Gharaibeh M., Al-Maaitah R., Jada N., Lifestyle practices of Jordanian pregnant women, International Nursing Review, 52, pp. 92-100, (2005); Zwane I.T., (2005); (2006); 10<sub>th</sub> Round of National HIV Serosurveillance in Women Attending Antenatal Care, Sexually Transmitted Infections Clients and Tuberculosis Patients at Health Facilities in Swaziland, (2006); Schneider Z., Elliot D., LoBiondo-Wood G., Haber J., Nursing Research: Methods, Critical Appraisal, and Utilisation, (2003); Burns N., Grove S.K., Understanding Nursing Research: Building Evidence Based Practice, (2007); Munhall P., Nursing Research: A Qualitative Perspective, (2007); Lincoln Y.S., Guba E.G., Naturalistic Inquiry, (1985); Maimbolwa M.C., Yamba B., Diwan V., Ransjo-Arvidson A., Cultural childbirth practices and beliefs in, Zambia.

Over 700 nurses participated in the survey, representing almost 50% of the graduate nurse population. The findings reported here provide a qualitative insight into the reasons underlying their preferences, the difficulties they experience in pursuing further education and the reasons why pragmatic rather than preferred choices must be made. It will be argued that these are important considerations in planning for future developments in postgraduate education in Hong Kong. They may also prove useful to countries facing similar developments. © 1997 Pearson Professional Ltd.","","Adult; Data Collection; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Nursing Education Research; adult; article; Hong Kong; human; information processing; male; methodology; nursing education; standard","","","","","","","Barriball K.L., While A.E., Norman I.J., Continuing professional education for qualified nurses, a view of the literature, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 17, pp. 1129-1140, (1992); Chapman C., Report on Post-basic Nursing Education, (1990); Charles M., Continuing education in nursing: Whose responsibility, Nurse Education Today, 2, pp. 5-11, (1982); Fitzpatrick J., While A., Roberts J., The relationship between nursing and higher education, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 18, pp. 1488-1497, (1993); Green C., Multiple role women: The real world of the mature RN learner, Journal of Nursing Education, 26, 7, pp. 266-271, (1987); Green M., Future directions for nursing education, Future Directions for Nursing: Nursing Conference, pp. 20-34, (1992); Knowles M., The Modern Practice of Adult Education: from Pedagogy to Andragogy, 2nd Edn., (1980); O'Mullan J., Introducing a pre-registration nursing degree programme in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Nursing Journal, 68, pp. 29-30, (1995); Simsen B., Holroyd E., Sellick K., Post Graduate Education Expectations of Hong Kong's Graduate Nurses, (1995); Wang R., Lethbridge D., Becoming gold-plated: Chinese nurses studying abroad, Image: Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 27, 2, pp. 131-134, (1995); Interim Progress Report on Development of Nurse Specialists, (1991); The Development of Clinical Nurse Specialists in Hong Kong, (1992)","","","Churchill Livingstone","","","","","","02606917","","","9370628","English","Nurse Educ.

She employed an ethnographic approach to interview 15 Hong Kong Chinese families caring for children aged 5 to 16 with disabilities. Twelve of these families included sons with disabilities. The following themes emerged: disruptions to natural order, public opinions on what constitutes personhood and ordered bodies, and the establishment of moral reputations linked to shame and blame and the gendered division of parenting. The author highlights the centrality of parenthood in Chinese society as the acceptance of responsibility and its cyclic enactment, and emphasizes how the care of children with handicaps strains and violates the Chinese culturally expected order of parental obligations. © 2003 Sage Publications.","","Adolescent; Attitude to Health; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Confucianism; Cultural Characteristics; Disabled Children; Ethics; Home Nursing; Hong Kong; Humans; Interviews; Moral Obligations; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Public Opinion; article; child care; disability; ethnography; health belief; Hong Kong; human; parental behavior; priority journal; adolescent; attitude to health; caregiver; child; child parent relation; cultural factor; ethics; ethnology; handicapped child; home care; interview; morality; parent; preschool child; psychological aspect; public opinion; religion","","","","","","","Drive fails to change attitude to handicapped, South China Morning Post, (1995); Families sought for unwanted children, South China Morning Post, (1995); Fear for rights of disabled, South China Morning Post, (1995); Gabrenya W.K., Kwang K.H., Chinese social interaction: Harmony and hierarchy on the good earth, The Handbook of Chinese Psychology, pp. 309-321, (1996); Ho D.Y.F., Fatherhood in Chinese culture, The Father's Role: Cross-cultural Perspectives, pp. 227-265, (1987); Informal answer to child problem, South China Morning Post, (1995); Ingstad B., Whyte R.S., Disability and Culture, (1995); It is so unfair.

This study examined the relationship between sex-role stereotypes, self-concept and the requisite personality characteristics of an ideal nurse in a cohort of Hong Kong nursing students. Methods. To rate these concepts a measure of eight comprehensive dimensions of personality perception was administered to 177 nursing students, studying on preregistration and postregistration programs at a Hong Kong tertiary institution. Both male and female nursing students perceived an ideal nurse to possess a profile of traits including being high on the dimensions of emotional stability, application, intellect, helpfulness and restraint. Results. No significant difference between the self-ratings of the male and female students was found, indicating that male students had undergone a highly self-selective process when choosing nursing education under the influence of Chinese cultural stereotypical attitudes towards nursing. A typical Chinese nurse was rated as similar to the typical female in Chinese society by both male and female nursing students. A typical Chinese nurse was rated relatively low on the masculine dimensions of openness, extroversion and assertiveness. The self-ratings of male nursing students more closely approximated the ideal nurse than did the self-ratings of female nursing students. Conclusion. The conclusions highlight implications for the recruitment and education of both male and female nursing students in Hong Kong society.","Chinese; Gender; Nursing; Role ideal; Self-concept; Sex-role; Stereotype; Students","Cohort Studies; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Nurse's Role; Nurses; Nursing; Prejudice; Self Concept; Stereotyping; Students, Nursing; article; cohort analysis; female; Hong Kong; human; male; nurse; nurse attitude; nursing; nursing student; psychological aspect; self concept; social psychology; standard","","","","","","","Becker H., Sands D., The relationship of empathy to clinical experience among male and female nursing students, Journal of Nursing Education, 27, pp. 198-203, (1988); Bem S.L., BEM Sex Role Inventory, (1974); Bonvillian N., Women and Men: Cultural Constructs of Gender, (1995); Views of the two sexes on the female role, Breakthrough Newsletter, Hong Kong, 3, pp. 6-9, (1976); Cheung F.M., Lao B.L.L., Au K.C., Ngai S.S.Y., Gender roles identity stereotypes and attitudes in Hong Kong, Engendering Hong Kong Society, pp. 152-174, (1997); Constantinople A., Masculinity-feminity: An exception to a famous dictum, Psychological Bulletin, 80, pp. 389-407, (1973); Conway M.E., Socialisation and roles in nursing, Annual Review of Nursing Research, 1, pp. 183-208, (1983); Cook E.P., Psychological Androgyny, (1985); Culkin J., Tricario D., Cohen P., Sex role orientation of nursing students at a community college, Psychological Reports, 60, pp. 948-950, (1987); Egeland J.W., Brown J.S., Sex role stereotyping and role strain of male registered nurses, Research in Nursing and Health, 11, pp. 257-267, (1988); Fisher M., Sex role characteristics of males in nursing, Contemporary Nurse, 8, pp. 65-71, (1999); Fitzgerald L.F., Betz N.E., Issues in the vocational psychology of women, Handbook of Vocational Psychology, pp. 181-199, (1983); Fitzgerald L.F., Cherpas C.C., On the reciprocal relationship between gender and occupations: Rethinking the assumptions concerning masculine career development, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 27, pp. 109-122, (1985); Gould R., Measuring masculinity by the size of the paycheck, Men and Masculinity, pp. 218-235, (1974); Jinks A.M., A study of attitudes to gender and nursing stereotypes in newly recruited student nurses, Nursing Education Today, 13, pp. 287-294, (1993); Kinney C.D., A re-examination of nursing role conception, Nursing Research, 34, pp. 170-176, (1985); Lai M., Bond M.H., Gender Stereotypes and the Self-concept in Hong Kong Youth, (1997); Lee W.K.M., Women employment in Hong Kong, The Other Hong Kong Report, pp. 277-306, (1996); Muldoon O., Kremer J., Career aspiration, job satisfaction and gender identity in female nursing student nurses, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 21, pp. 544-550, (1995); O'Heron C.A., Orlofsky J.L., Stereotypic and non sterotypic sex role trait behaviour orientations, gender identity and psychological adjustment, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2, pp. 299-1273, (1990); Rossiter J.C., Foong A., Chan P.T., Attitudes of Hong Kong high school students towards the nursing profession, Nursing Education Today, 19, pp. 464-471, (1999); Salvage J., Nurses, Gender and Sexuality, (1987); Seyfried B.A., Hendrick C., When do opposites attract?

A specific focus was on how these men's sexual practices varied across sexual venues and among different partners in order to better understand sociocultural facilitators and barriers to condom use in the Guangzhou community. Qualitative data were obtained through semi-structured in-depth interviews with MSM and ethnographic observations in MSM sexual venues in the city. The thematic analysis focused specifically on the accounts of unprotected sex occasions. We found that an erotic idea of rouyu (desire of physical flesh) embedded in a subculture of MSM and a metaphor for condom use as being inferior and promoting distance posed a considerable barrier to condom use among these MSM. Some men reported gaining a positive self-concept related to same-sex identity through unprotected sex. These MSM's subjective evaluations of HIV risk were closely tied to the perceived characteristics of sex partners and sexual venues. We conclude by advocating specific sociocultural interventions in emerging risk venues, such as saunas/bathhouses, to better meet the needs of the MSM community in Guangzhou. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","China; ethnography; HIV/STD; men who have sex with men; sexual venues; unprotected sex","Adult; China; Condoms; Cultural Characteristics; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Hygiene; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Steam Bath; Unsafe Sex; Young Adult; adult; anilingus; article; China; condom; cultural factor; erotism; ethnography; gender identity; high risk behavior; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection risk; male; male homosexual; normal human; priority journal; self concept; semi structured interview; sexual behavior; thematic analysis","","","","","Ford Foundation","The authors would like to thank the participants for sharing their life histories and the Chi Heng Foundation and Aibai.cn for helping the study fieldwork.

The purpose of this exploratory study was to describe the type and nature of psychosocial nursing interventions provided for cardiac clients in Hong Kong's Community Rehabilitation Centres (CRNs). Design/methods. Using a two-phase case study design data were collected from nurses, cardiac clients and their caregivers. The initial phase focused on identifying the types of psychosocial interventions provided. These data were obtained by observing nursing activities and the keeping of daily journals by the nurses. The second phase acquired data from structured telephone interviews, that reviewed clients' perceptions of the psychosocial interventions provided by the nurses and face-to-face interviews with clients and their caregivers. Findings. These findings revealed that the nurses' interpersonal skills of information giving, social support and counselling were highly valued by cardiac clients and their caregivers. Both clients and caregivers outlined a concern about the lack of individual care and this was reflected in the focus of the CRN on group processes. Conclusion. Recommendations for psychosocial cardiac care are made for public health nurses and nurses working in community settings.","Cardiac clients; Community case study; Hong Kong; Nursing interventions; Psychosocial","Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Health; Communication; Community Health Nursing; Community Networks; Female; Group Processes; Heart Diseases; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurse-Patient Relations; Nursing Evaluation Research; Patient Care Planning; Questionnaires; Rehabilitation Centers; Rehabilitation Nursing; Social Support; aged; article; attitude to health; community care; community health nursing; evaluation; female; group process; health personnel attitude; heart disease; Hong Kong; human; interpersonal communication; male; methodology; middle aged; nurse patient relationship; nursing; nursing evaluation research; patient care planning; psychological aspect; questionnaire; rehabilitation center; rehabilitation nursing; social support; standard","","","","","","","Bond M.H., The Handbook of Chinese Psychology, (1996); Braithwaite V., Caregiving burden, Research on Ageing, 14, pp. 3-27, (1992); Brislin R.W., The wording and translation of research instruments, Field Methods in Cross-Cultural Research, pp. 185-216, (1986); Chow N.S.W., Ageing in Hong Kong, Social Issues in Hong Kong, pp. 164-177, (1992); Corley S.C., Scheafer T., Inter-disciplinary teams in healthcare: Integration of family caregivers, Social Work in Healthcare, 22, pp. 59-70, (1996); Cowen M.E., Bannister M., Shellenberger R., Tilden R., A guide for planning community-oriented healthcare, Medical Care, 34, pp. 264-279, (1996); Annual Departmental Report, (1995); Farran C.J., Horton-Deutsch S., Meyer M., Bougard L., Quantifying psychosocial nursing interventions provided to geropsychiatric inpatients, Scholarly Inquiry for Nursing Practice, 2, pp. 167-173, (1998); Fleury J.D., Wellness motivation in cardiac rehabilitation, Heart and Lung, 20, pp. 3-8, (1991); Gibh H., Holroyd E.A., Images of old age in the Hong Kong print media, Ageing and Society, 16, pp. 151-175, (1996); Hill J., Client satisfaction in a nurse-led rheumatology clinic, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 25, pp. 347-354, (1997); Hoeman S.P., Foreword transdisciplinary teamwork, Holistic Nursing Practice, 7, pp. VI-VIII, (1993); Hoeman S.P., Glenn N.H., Stymacks A., Rehabilitation Restorative Care in the Community, (1990); Holroyd E.A., Lee Y.K., Wong P.Y., Yau K.H., Leung S.L., Hong Kong Chinese women's perceptions of support from midwives during labour, Midwifery, 13, pp. 66-72, (1997); Janus E.D., Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study, (1996); Kelsey A., Outcome measures: Problems and opportunities for public health nursing, Journal of Nursing Management, 3, pp. 183-187, (1995); Kozier B., Erb C., Blais K., Concepts and Issues in Nursing Practice 2nd Edn., (1992); Kwok J., The role of the family in disability concerned policies and services: Challenges for community-based rehabilitation in the Asian and Pacific decade of disabled persons, 1993-2002, International Journal of Rehabilitation Research, 18, pp. 351-356, (1992); Ngan R., Cheng I.C.K., The caring dilemma: Stress and needs of caregivers for the Chinese frail elderly, Hong Kong Journal of Gerontology, 6, pp. 77-94, (1992); Norman I., Redfern S., The validity of Qualpacs, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 22, pp. 1174-1181, (1995); Peat M., Boyce W., Canadian community rehabilitation services: Challenges for the future, Canadian Journal of Rehabilitation, 6, pp. 281-289, (1993); Hoeman S., Community-based rehabilitation, Holistic Nursing Practice, 6, pp. 32-41, (1992); Poole K., The evolving role of the clinical nurse specialist within the comprehensive breast cancer centre, Journal of Clinical Nursing, 5, pp. 341-349, (1996); Schlueter P.L., White C., Providers' and consumers' perceptions of quality healthcare, Journal of Nursing Staff Development, 4, pp. 5-10, (1991); Shin A.Y., Twinn S.F., Holroyd E., The contribution of nursing to an interprofessional community-based rehabilitation team: Perceptions of nurses, patients and carers, Journal of Interprofessional Care, 13, pp. 65-75, (1999); Thomas L.H., Macmillian J., McColl E., Priest J., Hale C., Bond S., Obtaining clients' views of nursing care to inform the development of a client satisfaction scale, International Journal for Quality in Healthcare, 7, pp. 153-163, (1996); Wendelt M.A., Ager J.W., Quality Client Care Scale, (1974); Wong F.K.Y., Health-care reform and the transformation of nursing in Hong Kong, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 28, pp. 473-482, (1998); Yeung S., The community care policy of services for the elderly in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Journal of Gerontology, 6, pp. 8-12, (1990)","E.

Little, however, is known about CAM usage among nurses from Hong Kong who while of Chinese origin, are educated in western medical principles while exhibiting both folk knowledge and lay use of CAM in their daily lives. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the beliefs and attitudes towards CAM in a population of Hong Kong registered nurses. A particular focus was the sources of CAM information and the nurse's professional communication exchanges about CAM usage. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting and participants: The survey was conducted from March to June 2006 with registered nurses (N = 187) drawn form the Hong Kong College of Nursing. Results: Nearly three quarters (71.9%) of the nurses agreed that CAM should be integrated into mainstream Western medicine. The majority (89.8%) of participants did not agree that CAM should not be taken when using Western medicine. The most common sources for the nurses surveyed to obtain CAM information were, in order of frequency, newspapers and magazines (64.2%), friends (57.2%) and books (43.9%). Approximately one in three (28.0-35.3%) participants had either sometimes or frequently initiated a discussion about CAM or a discussion about the interaction between CAM and Western medicine with nursing colleague. Consistently, nurses who had previously received training on CAM (48.9%) were also more likely to initiate CAM discussions than those who had not received such training (30.7%, p < 0.05). Conclusion: More knowledge of CAM was in general, welcomed among nurses, with 93.6% of the nurses surveyed reporting an interest in further learning. A major recommendation is that HK registered nurses receive professional CAM training as a means to enhance patient care. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Setting: a postnatal ward in a Hong Kong public hospital. Participants: purposive sample of 30 Hong Kong Chinese women, from 24 to 38 hours after delivery. Key Findings: the category of 'informational support' with the specific behaviour of 'praise' was identified as the most supportive . Tangible support such as 'touching' was considered the least helpful behaviour. Implications for practice: suggestions are made for promoting culturally-sensitive midwifery care for Chinese women to include: 'saving face'; interpreting personal orientation; and supporting Chinese 'hot and cold' beliefs.","","Adult; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Labor, Obstetric; Nurse Midwives; Nurse-Patient Relations; Patient Education; Patient Satisfaction; Pregnancy; Social Support; adult; article; China; cross-sectional study; ethnology; female; Hong Kong; human; labor; nurse midwife; nurse patient relationship; patient education; patient satisfaction; pregnancy; psychological aspect; social support; standard","","","","","","","Beaton J., Gupton A., Childbirth expectations: A qualitative analysis, Midwifery, 6, 3, pp. 133-139, (1990); Bond M.H., Beyond the Chinese Face: Insight from Psychology, (1991); Bond M.H., The Handbook of Chinese Psychology, (1996); Boyle J.S., Andrews M.M., Transcultural Concepts in Nursing Care, (1989); Bryanton J., Fraser-Davey H., Sullivan P., Women's perceptions of nursing support during labor, Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing, 23, 5, pp. 638-644, (1994); Callister L.C., Cultural meanings of childbirth, Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing, 24, 4, pp. 327-330, (1995); Cartwright A., Who are maternity services kind to?

This was an exploratory descriptive study using mixed methodology to investigate Hong Kong Chinese women's perceptions of the effectiveness of antenatal education in their preparation for motherhood. Design. In the first phase, the structure and process of five antenatal classes on the topic of motherhood were observed using an observation guide. In the second phase 11 women who had attended the antenatal classes were interviewed in two focus groups, using a semi-structured interview guide. Findings. In respect to the structure of the classes women revealed that large class sizes and the didactic mode of teaching inhibited learning. While they were satisfied with the date and time of antenatal classes, and the information about self and baby care being provided, they felt unprepared for the demands of motherhood. Further themes identified from the analysis were: anticipating personal needs for antenatal preparation for motherhood, unrealistic preparation for breastfeeding problems, inadequate preparation for baby care, unfulfilled informational needs and conflicting advice from antenatal educators. Conclusion. The conclusion highlights Chinese culturally specific changes needed in the content and mode of antenatal education. In addition, recommendations are made for antenatal educators to work within a framework of adult Chinese learning styles in order to meet the educational needs of Chinese women.","Antenatal education; Hong Kong; Maternal role transition; Midwifery; Motherhood","Adult; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Labor, Obstetric; Maternal Behavior; Parenting; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Education; Patient Satisfaction; Pregnancy; Time Factors; adult; article; child parent relation; ethnology; female; Hong Kong; human; labor; maternal behavior; patient attitude; patient education; patient satisfaction; pregnancy; psychological aspect; standard; time","","","","","","","Appleton J.V., Analyzing qualitative interview data; addressing issues of validity and reliability, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 22, pp. 993-997, (1995); Ball J.A., Reactions to Motherhood, (1987); Barclay L., Everitt L., Rogan F., Schmied V., Wylie A., Becoming a mother- An analysis of women's experience of early motherhood, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 25, pp. 719-728, (1997); Barclay L., Lloyd B., The misery of motherhood: Alternative approaches to maternal distress, Midwifery, 12, pp. 136-139, (1996); Bechelmayr P.E., The effect of Lamaze childbirth preparation on anxiety, Journal of Perinatal Education, 4, pp. 15-19, (1995); Brown S.G., Johnson B.T., Enhancing early discharge with home follow up: A pilot project, Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing, 27, pp. 33-38, (1998); Burnard P., A method of analyzing interview transcripts in qualitative research, Nurse Education Today, 11, pp. 161-466, (1991); Burns S., Artistry in Training, Thinking Differently about the Way You Help People to Learn, (1996); Chang Y.L.C., Postpartum worries: An exploration o Taiwanese primiparas who participate in the Chinese ritual of Tso-Yueh-Tzu, Maternal Child Nursing Journal, 23, pp. 110-122, (1995); Choi P.K., Lee C.K., The hidden abode of domestic labor: The case of Hong Kong, Engendering Hong Kong Society: a Gender Perspective of Women's Status, pp. 157-199, (1997); Enkin W., Roundtable discussion, Birth, 17, pp. 90-91, (1990); Fichardt A.E., Van Wyk N.C., Weich M., The needs of postpartum women, Curiationi, 17, pp. 15-21, (1994); Hallgren A., Kihlgren M., Norbery A., A descriptive study of childbirth education provided by midwives in Sweden, Midwifery, 10, pp. 215-224, (1994); Hallgren A., Kihlgren M., Norbery A., Forslin L., Women's perceptions of childbirth and childbirth education before and after birth, Midwifery, 11, pp. 130-137, (1995); Hibbard B.M., Robinson J.O., Pearson J.F., Rosen M., Taylor A., The effectiveness of antenatal education, Journal of Health Education, 38, pp. 39-46, (1979); Hillan E.M., Issues in the delivery of midwifery care, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 3, pp. 274-278, (1992); Holroyd E., Fung K.L., Lam S.C., Ha S.W., Doing the month: An exploration of postpartum practices in Chinese women, Journal of Health Care for Women International, 18, pp. 301-315, (1997); Population Census 1996, (1996); Jarvis P., Gibson S., The Teacher Practitioner and Mentor in Nursing, Midwifery and the Social Services, 2nd Edn., (1997); Kirkham M., Antenatal learning, Nursing Times, 87, (1991); Knowles M.S., Andragogy in Action, (1984); Leung E., An evaluation on antenatal education program: The client's perspective, Evidence Base Nursing Practice Project, (1996); Lindell S., Education for childbirth: A time for change, Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing, MARCH-APRIL, pp. 108-112, (1988); Liu-Chiang C.Y., Postpartum worries: An exploration of Taiwanese primiparas who participate in the Chinese ritual of Tso-Yueh-Tzu, Maternal-Child Nursing Journal, 23, pp. 110-122, (1995); Lumley J., Brown S., Attenders and non-attenders at childbirth education classes in Australia: How do they and their births differ?, Birth, 20, pp. 123-130, (1993); Mercer R.T., The process of maternal role attainment over the first year, Nursing Research, 34, pp. 198-204, (1985); Morse J.M., Qualitative Nursing Research - a Contemporary Dialogue, (1991); Murphy-Black T., Antenatal education, Antenatal Care: A Research-Based Approach, pp. 88-104, (1990); Nolan M., Antenatal education, where next?, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 25, pp. 1198-1204, (1997); Nolan M., Hicks C., Aims, process and problems of antenatal education as identified by three groups of childbirth teachers, Midwifery, 13, pp. 179-188, (1998); Nunnerley R., Deane-Gray T., Parent education: Are the right people teaching parentcraft classes?

Despite the provision of cervical screening programs, women's attendance for screening remains low at 59%. Evidence suggests that women's knowledge about cervical cancer and preventive strategies are significant to their screening practice. A preliminary pilot study consisting of a two-phase descriptive design using quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection was undertaken to investigate the level of knowledge about cervical cancer and cervical screening among a population of Hong Kong Chinese women. From a total sample of 467 women, 242 (52%) responded to a confidential questionnaire, 18 of whom, aged between 30 and 54 years, volunteered to participate in a semistructured interview. A total of 135 (57%) women had attended screening, with those who were married with children significantly more likely to attend. Although no significant difference was found between the overall level of knowledge of attenders and nonattenders, individual items such as women's knowledge of risk factors were significant. The need for further knowledge about the preventive nature of cervical screening and regular screening was demonstrated. Other factors influencing Chinese women's attendance patterns included advice from practitioners and the significance of children to women's propensity for self-care. The implications of these findings to women's attendance patterns for screening are considered, particularly the need for culturally sensitive health promotion and intervention strategies.","Attendance patterns; Cervical screening; Hong Kong Chinese women; Knowledge","adult; article; cancer screening; Chinese; clinical practice; female; health behavior; Hong Kong; human; interview; medical information; pilot study; priority journal; questionnaire; risk factor; uterine cervix cancer","","","","","","","Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Hong Kong 1998-1999, (2001); Marcus A.C., Crane L.A., A review of cervical cancer screening intervention research: Implication for public health programs and future research, Prev Med, 27, pp. 13-31, (1998); Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Family Planning Survey in Hong Kong 1997, (1999); Adab P., McGhee S., The Pattern of Cervical Screening in Hong Kong, (2001); Fylan F., Screening for cervical cancer: A review of women's attitudes, knowledge and behaviour, Br J Gen Pract, 48, pp. 1509-1514, (1998); Kim K., Yu E.S.H., Chen E.H., Kim J.M.P.H., Kaufman M., Purkiss J.B.S., Cervical cancer screening knowledge and practices amongst Korean-American women, Cancer Nurs, 22, 4, pp. 297-302, (1999); Yu C.K.H., Rymer J., Women's attitudes and awareness of smear testing and cervical cancer, Br J Fam Plan, 23, pp. 127-133, (1998); Eaker S., Hans-Olov A., Par S., Reasons women do not attend screening for cervical cancer: A population-based study in Sweden, Prev.

With many overseas universities competing to secure Asian students, the need for locally developed programmes to meet Hong Kong's needs can be overlooked. In this survey 705 nurses with degree level qualifications working for the major public and private employing agencies completed a questionnaire designed to obtain details of postgraduate study plans and preferences for the type, focus and mode of postgraduate programmes. Analysis of responses showed 50% of the graduates surveyed intended to pursue further study in the next two years with a clear preference for course work masters, degree programmes (55%), studies with a specialist (71%) rather than a generalist focus, and programmes offered locally (85%) on a part-time basis (86%). Future educational needs were also found to vary according to gender, marital status, place of employment and nursing post. The findings from this survey have considerable implications for educational and professional nursing developments and planning to meet the future health care needs of Hong Kong. In addition, the information may inform the planning of other countries newly embarked on tertiary education for nurses.","","Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Career Choice; Career Mobility; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Education, Nursing, Graduate; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Nurses; Nursing Education Research; Questionnaires; Specialties, Nursing; adult; article; career mobility; decision making; education; female; health personnel attitude; Hong Kong; human; male; nurse; nursing discipline; nursing education; psychological aspect; questionnaire","","","","","","","Chapman C., Report on Post-basic Nursing Education, (1990); Health Manpower Survey 1992, (1992); Green M., Future directions for nursing education, Future Directions for Nursing: Nursing Conference, pp. 20-34, (1992); Houle C., Continuing Learning in the Professions, (1980); Guidelines on Continuing Education for National Nurses' Associations, (1992); Guidelines on Specialisation in Nursing, (1992); James E., The carving out of a professional future, Nursing Mirror, pp. 32-33, (1983); Position of Nurses Register as at 1.7.1994, (1994); O'Mullan J., Introducing a pre-registration nursing degree programme in Hong Kong, The Hong Kong Nursing Journal, 68, pp. 29-30, (1995); Poon W., Development of nurse specialists in Hong Kong, A.H.K.N.S., 23, pp. 1-6, (1992); Simsen B., Holroyd E., Sellick K., Postgraduate Education Expectations of Hong Kong's Graduate Nurses, (1995); Styles M., Bridging the gap between competence and excellence, ANNA Journal, 18, 4, pp. 355-366, (1991); Tornyay R., Reconsidering nursing education: The report of the Pew Health Professions Commission, Journal of Nursing Education, 31, pp. 296-301, (1992); Project 2000: A New Preparation for Practice, (1986); Interim Progress Report on Development of Nurse Specialists, (1991); The Development of Clinical Nurse Specialists in Hong Kong, (1992); The Future of Nursing Education in Hong Kong, (1992); Part I: Basic nursing education, Future Directions of Nursing Education, (1992); Part II: Post-basic nursing education, Future Directions of Nursing Education, (1993); Nursing in action project: Developing a regulatory framework for nursing, Health for All Nursing Series, 7, pp. 1-29, (1991)","","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","03092402","","JANUD","8894901","English","J.

Measures of maternal role competence and satisfaction are limited in the Chinese population. OBJECTIVES:: To translate the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale into Chinese (C-PSOC) and to examine the psychometric properties of the C-PSOC. METHODS:: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a convenience sample of 170 mothers recruited from a postnatal unit. Participants completed the C-PSOC, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. A randomly selected subsample of 57 mothers participated in the 4-week retest. RESULTS:: The C-PSOC demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's ± ≤ .85) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient ≤ .87). Factor analysis supported the two-factor structure reflecting the efficacy and satisfaction dimensions of the original instrument. The scale discriminated between primiparas and multiparas (t ≤ 2.2, p < .05). Significant correlations with Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (r ≤ .60, p < .01) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (r ≤ ĝ̂'.48, p < .01) demonstrated good construct validity. CONCLUSION:: The C-PSOC has satisfactory psychometric properties. It has the potential to be used as a clinical and research instrument for measuring maternal role competence and satisfaction in the Chinese population.

Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire study. Participants: Registered nurses who were members of the Hong Kong College of Nursing were invited to participate. Main outcome measures: Demographic data of the respondents, prevalence of personal and professional use of complementary and alternative medicines, including their use for detailed clinical conditions. Results: A total of 187 nurses participated in this study. Nearly four fifths (80%; 95% confidence interval, 74-86%) of the participants had used at least one form of complementary/ alternative medicine. In addition to the personal use of such treatment, over two fifths (41%; 95% confidence interval, 34-48%) had recommended at least one form of complementary/alternative medicine to their patients. These included bone-setting (20%), Chinese remedial massage (tuina, 19%), and meditation (19%). Specifically, registered nurses recommended acupuncture or acupressure to patients with musculoskeletal disorders, chronic pain, or headaches/migraines. Conclusions: Personal use and professional recommendations for complementary and alternative medicine by registered nurses in Hong Kong is substantial. Registered nurses played an active role in advising such treatment for their patients based on their personal knowledge of perceived benefit in specific conditions. Further investigations with a larger sample size should focus on registered nurses' educational needs in respect of complementary and alternative medicine and the advice they recommended.","Complementary therapies; Health personnel; Medicine, Chinese traditional; Nurses; Utilization review","Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Complementary Therapies; Female; Health Promotion; Health Status; Health Surveys; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Utilization Review; acupressure; acupuncture; alternative medicine; article; Chinese medicine; chronic pain; headache; Hong Kong; massage; medical practice; meditation; migraine; musculoskeletal disease; questionnaire; registered nurse; Tui Na; adult; female; health personnel attitude; health promotion; health status; health survey; human; male; middle aged; nurse; statistics; utilization review","","","","","","","Eisenberg D.M., Davis R.B., Ettner S.L., Et al., Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990-1997: Results of a follow-up national survey, JAMA, 280, pp. 1569-1575, (1998); Xue C.C., Zhang A.L., Lin V., Da Costa C., Story D.F., Complementary and alternative medicine use in Australia: A national population-based survey, J Altern Complement Med, 13, pp. 643-650, (2007); Chung V., Wong E., Woo J., Lo S.V., Griffiths S., Use of traditional Chinese medicine in the Hong Kong special administrative region of China, J Altern Complement Med, 13, pp. 361-367, (2007); Holroyd E., Health-seeking behaviors and social change: The experience of the Hong Kong Chinese elderly, Qual Health Res, 12, pp. 731-750, (2002); Molassiotis A., Chan C.W., Fatigue patterns in Chinese patients receiving radiotherapy, Eur J Oncol Nurs, 8, pp. 334-340, (2004); McGrath C., The use of Traditional Chinese Medicine in managing oral health - Hong Kong: One country, two systems, Int Dent J, 55, pp. 302-306, (2005); Tzeng Y.L., A study on the nursing staff's knowledge, attitude and behaviour and their related factors toward Chinese medicine, Journal of Nursing (China), 46, pp. 57-70, (1999); Lam T.P., Strengths and weaknesses of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in the eyes of some Hong Kong Chinese, J Epidemiol Community Health, 55, pp. 762-765, (2001); Tovey P., Adams J., Nostalgic and nostophobic referencing and the authentication of nurses' use of complementary therapies, Soc Sci Med, 56, pp. 1469-1480, (2003); Lie D., Boker J., Development and validation of the CAM Health Belief Questionnaire (CHBQ) and CAM use and attitudes amongst medical students, BMC Med Educ, 4, (2004); Barnes P.M., Powell-Griner E., McFann K., Nahin R.L., Complementary and alternative medicine use among adults: United States, 2002, Adv Data, 343, pp. 1-19, (2004); Chen L., Chang M., Tzeng Y., Lin J., Shih H., The views of Traditional Chinese medicine institutional workers toward TCM nursing practises in Taiwan (Chinese), The Journal of Nursing (Nursing), 49, pp. 28-36, (2002); Hon K.L., Twinn S.F., Leung T.F., Thompson D.R., Wong Y., Fok T.F., Chinese nursing students' attitudes toward traditional Chinese medicine, J Nurs Educ, 45, pp. 182-185, (2006); Hon K.L., Leung T.F., Tse H.M., Et al., A survey of attitudes to traditional Chinese medicine among Chinese medical students, Am J Chin Med, 33, pp. 269-279, (2005); Hon E.K., Lee K., Tse H.M., Et al., A survey of attitudes to Traditional Chinese Medicine in Hong Kong pharmacy students, Complement Ther Med, 12, pp. 51-56, (2004)","E.

A multiple case study design was used including a programme satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ), an antenatal knowledge questionnaire (CANKQ), and telephone interviews repeated during pregnancy and postnatally with the women attending each programme. Antenatal knowledge was seen to improve at both hospitals as a result of the programme. The interpersonal skills of the midwives, the presentation skills of the educators and the perceived accessibility of the health professionals to ask questions to were considered important to the Chinese women. In addition, the importance of providing education about Chinese medicine in pregnancy and postnatal care (e.g. the need for rest and recovery, and restrictions on their activities) was emphasized. The need for a comprehensive curriculum covering all stages of the childbirth process from pre-pregnancy to parenting was highlighted. The importance of regular evaluation to ensure antenatal education programmes continue to meet Chinese women's needs and expectations is suggested. From this study, recommendations are made to develop a framework which incorporates a methodology for health education planning that focuses on the effectiveness of health services from the perspective of Chinese.","","","","","","","","","Cheung W., Ip Y., Chan D., Maternal anxiety and feelings of control during labour: A study of Chinese first-time pregnant women, Midwifery, 23, 2, pp. 123-130, (2007); Creemers B.P., Kyriakides L., Sammons P., Methodological Advances in Educational Effectiveness Research, (2010); Donabedian A., Evaluating the quality of medical care, Milbank Quarterly, 83, 4, pp. 691-729, (2005); Gagnon A.L., Sandall J., Individual or group antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both, Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 3, (2007); George L., Lack of preparedness, MCN AM J Matern Child Nurs, 30, 4, pp. 251-255, (2005); Hibbard B.M., Robinson J.O., Pearson J.F., Rosen M., Taylor A., The effectiveness of antenatal education, Health Educ J, 38, 2, pp. 39-46, (1999); Holroyd E., Yin-king L., Pui-yuk L.W., Kwok-hong F.Y., Shuk-lin B.L., Hong Kong Chinese women's perception of support from midwives during labour, Midwifery, 13, 2, pp. 66-72, (1997); Holroyd E., Katie F.K., Chun L.S., Ha S.W., Doing the month': An exploration of postpartum practices in Chinese women, Health Care Women Int, 18, 3, pp. 301-315, (1997); Ip W.Y., Csk T., Goggins W.B., An educational intervention to improve women's ability to cope with childbirth, J Clin Nurs, 18, 15, pp. 2125-2135, (2009); Lee Y.K., Hong Kong Chinese Women's Perceptions of Childbirth Education Classes, (1998); Leung T.Y., French P., Leung A., An evaluation on antenatal education programme: The client's perspective, Asia Journal of Nursing Studies, 4, 1, pp. 18-25, (1998); Nichols F.H., Humenick S.S., Childbirth Education: Practice, Research and Theory, (2000); Nolan M.L., Antenatal education: Failing to educate for parenthood, BJM, 5, 1, pp. 21-26, (1997); O'meara C., An evaluation of consumer perspectives of childbirth and parenting education, Midwifery, 9, 4, pp. 210-219, (1993); O'meara C.M., A diagnostic model for the evaluation of childbirth and parenting education, Midwifery, 9, 1, pp. 28-34, (1993); Peterson G., Childbirth: The ordinary miracle: Effects of devaluation of childbirth on women's self-esteem and family relationships, Int J Childbirth Educ, 23, 1, pp. 35-38, (2008); Portney L.G., Watkins M.P., Foundations of Clinical Research: Applications to Practice, (2009); Redman S., Oak S., Booth P., Jensen J., Saxton A., Evaluation of an antenatal education programme: Characteristics of attenders, changes in knowledge and satisfaction of participants, Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol, 31, 4, pp. 310-316, (1991); Rowe J., Mahoney P., Parent Education Guidance for Parents and Providers, (1993); Slaninak S.L., Galbraith A., Strzelecki S., Cockraft M., Collaborative research project: Effectiveness of birth preparation classes at community hospital, J Perinat Educ, 5, 3, pp. 29-35, (1996); Sturrock W.A., Johnson J., The relationship between childbirth education classes and obstetric outcome, Birth, 17, 2, pp. 82-85, (1990); Svensson J.L., Antenatal Education: Meeting Consumer Needs A Study Inhealth Services Development, (2005); Woollett A., Dosanjh N., Nicolson P., Marshall H., Djhanbakheh O., Hadlow J., The ideas and experiences of pregnancy and childbirth of Asian and non-Asian women in East London, Br J Med Psychol, 68, 1, pp. 65-84, (1995); Yin R.K., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, (2009)","","","MA Healthcare Ltd","","","","","","09694900","","","","English","Br.

Because culture and employment are important factors in the perception of health status, in this study we sought to determine the existence and features of PMS in Chinese clerical women in Hong Kong. We used a cross‐sectional, retrospective approach to collect data with a translation of an established questionnaire (the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire). Fatigue was found to be the most prevalent symptom, and the Pain, Water Retention, Behavioral Change, and Negative Affect scales had more than 64% frequency. The main difference between these findings and those of other studies is that negative affect featured most prominently in Western samples, whereas pain featured most highly in this sample of Chinese women. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Adolescent; Adult; Attitude to Health; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cultural Characteristics; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Premenstrual Syndrome; Questionnaires; Retrospective Studies; Women, Working; adolescent; adult; article; attitude to health; China; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; ethnology; female; Hong Kong; human; premenstrual syndrome; psychological aspect; questionnaire; retrospective study","","","","","","","Aroian K.J., Patsdaughter C.A., Multiple-method, cross-cultural assessment of psychological distress, Image: Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 21, pp. 90-93, (1989); Brislin R., Back-translation for cross-cultural research, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, I, pp. 185-216, (1970); Brooks-Gunn J., Ruble D.N., The development of menstrual related beliefs and behaviours during early adolescence, Child Development, 53, pp. 1567-1577, (1982); Busch C.M., Costa P., Whitehead W.E., Heller B.R., Severe premenstrual symptoms: Prevalence and effects on absenteeism and health care seeking in a nonclinical sample, Women and Health, 14, pp. 59-74, (1988); Corney R., Stanton R., A survey of 658 women who report symptoms for premenstrual syndrome, Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 35, pp. 471-482, (1991); Flaherty J.A., Gaviria F.M., Pathak D., Mitchell T., Wintrob R., Richman J.A., Birz S., Developing instruments for cross-cultural psychiatric research, Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 176, pp. 257-263, (1988); Friedman D., Jaffe A., Journal of Reproductive Medicine, 30, pp. 715-719, (1985); Gannon L., Luchetta T., Pardie L., Rhodes K., Relationships with chronic stress and selected life-style variables, Behavioral Medicine, 15, pp. 149-159, (1989); Hammarback S., Backstrom T., A demographic study in subgroups of women seeking help for premenstrual syndrome, Acta Obstetricia Et Gynecologica Scandinavica, 68, pp. 247-253, (1989); Hart W.G., Coleman G.J., Russell J.W., Assessment of premenstrual symptomatology: A re-evaluation of the predictive validity of self-report, Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 31, pp. 185-190, (1987); Johnson S.R., The epidemiology and social impact of premenstrual symptoms, Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology, 30, pp. 715-719, (1987); Knox V., Shum K., Mc Laughlin D.M., Response to cold pressor and to acupuncture analgesia in oriental and occidental subjects, Pain, 4, pp. 49-57, (1977); Lee K.A., Rittenhouse C.A., Prevalence of perimenstrual symptoms in employed women, Women and Health, 17, 3, pp. 17-33, (1991); Logue C., Moos R., Perimenstrual symptoms: Prevalence and risk factors, Psychosomatic Medicine, 48, pp. 388-414, (1986); Magos T., Treatment of premenstrual syndrome by subcutaneous estradiol implants, British Medical Journal, 292, pp. 1629-1633, (1986); Mao K., Chang A., Premenstrual syndrome in Chinese, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 25, pp. 118-120, (1985); Mayer C.R., The menstrual cycle, attitude and spatial test performance (Doctoral dissertation, Yeshiva University, 1982), Dissertation Abstracts International, 43, (1982); Moos R., Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, (1991); Mortola J., Girton L., Beck L., Yen S., Diagnosis of premenstrual syndrome by a simple, prospective and reliable instrument, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 76, pp. 302-307, (1990); Pearson V., Women in Hong Kong, Social Issues in Hong Kong, pp. 114-139, (1991); Prabha C., Santosh K., Cultural variations of premenstrual experience, International Journal of Social Psychiatry, 35, pp. 343-349, (1989); Rouse P., Premenstrual tension: A study using the Moos menstrual questionnaire, Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 22, pp. 215-222, (1978); Ruble D.N., Premenstrual symptoms: A reinterpretation, Science, 197, pp. 291-292, (1977); Siegel J., Myers B., Dineen M., Premenstrual tension syndrome symptom clusters, Journal of Reproductive Medicine, 32, pp. 395-399, (1987); Warner P., Brancroft J., Factors related to self-reporting of the premenstrual syndrome, British Journal of Psychiatry, 157, pp. 249-260, (1990); Wilson C.A., Keye W., A survey of adolescent dysmenorrhea and premenstrual symptom frequency.

Study setting: Community outreach approach in a few red-light districts in Hong Kong. Study design: A 30 min face-to-face interview was carried out in 89 women by direct approach and snowballing, followed by a focus group discussion drawn from the participants of the questionnaire. Results: While these FSWs' perception of personal health was good, a considerable proportion suffered from illnesses but the consultation rate was a third of the mean rate of the general population in Hong Kong. Many street workers experienced difficulty in utilizing health service in Hong Kong and even when they did, it was mainly for acute problems. Affordable access to health public services was excluded and many found private services unaffordable due to the high price charged by the practitioners. It was common for these women to self-medicate, delay in seeking medical help, or travel back to China for treatment. Conclusion: The current empirical understanding of the health and health service utilization by sex workers is unbalanced. In order to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV among the street sex workers, it is essential to address the fundamental issue of health care access. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The major concerns of the research team were with student learning approaches and student satisfaction. The research utilized a pre-/post-test experimental design as well as descriptive designs including non-participant observation of tutorials, tutor journal keeping and student interviews, to study the effects of a change from theory-based to learning process-based tutorials. The experimental design utilized the 'study process questionnaire' and the 'approaches to study inventory'. Two experimental groups showed a significant change in pre-/post-test scores. The qualitative data indicated that there were differences in the ways in which these two groups operated. The qualitative data also indicated that students were largely subscribing to achieving approaches and that satisfaction with tutorials was mainly related to relevance to the previous lecture as well as the perceived contribution to course assessment. As a consequence of this study it was concluded that the efficiency of tutorials could be increased by reducing the number of assignments, designing a set of specific tutorial activities that integrate theory and process, and having an explicit tutorial group formation policy. © 1998 Harcourt Brace & Co.

Tlie socially circulating messages and resources (e.g., pension allocation, marriage laws, housing options, and women's employment) inform an individual's decisions on negotiating and enacting care. Beijing family caregivers described reciprocity and the emotional forces of affection and hostility.

Aim: This research examines front-line nurses' reflections on the time of SARS in Hong Kong in order to articulate: (1) the nature and complexity of their experience, and (2) what lessons can be learned for future disease crises. Methods: Personal reflective essays written in 2004 by seven senior nurses studying a part-time Masters in Nursing degree at a Hong Kong university were analysed using a form of content analysis. Findings: The nurses' stories report immense personal costs on nurses, on their families and on the wider community. The analysis of the narratives was used to build a model, indicating how nurses' personal lives were 'sandwiched' between, on the one hand, their commitment to families and local community and, on the other hand, their professional commitment to the needs of a health system in crisis. Conclusion: In dealing with future health crises, it is imperative that a multilevel approach be taken. © 2008 International Council of Nurses.","Health crisis; Health system policy; Hong Kong; Narrative research; Role of nurses; SARS","Disease Outbreaks; Emergency Medical Services; Hong Kong; Humans; Life Change Events; Narration; Nursing Care; Patient Isolation; Professional-Family Relations; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; article; emergency health service; epidemic; Hong Kong; human; human relation; life event; nursing; nursing care; organization and management; patient care; psychological aspect; severe acute respiratory syndrome; verbal communication","","","","","","","(2005); Chan H.Y., Chan L.W., Affirming flames: Stress management for nurses under SARS outbreak, Hong Kong Nursing Journal, 39, pp. 21-23, (2003); (2003); Lee N., Hui D., Wu A., A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong, New England Journal of Medicine, 348, pp. 1986-1994, (2003); Lopez V., Chan K.S., Wong Y.C., Nursing care of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in the intensive care unit: Case reports in Hong Kong, International Journal of Nursing Studies, 41, pp. 263-272, (2004); Lopez V., Wong Y.C., Chan K.S., SARS: Consequences for nurses, intensive care units and the health care system in Hong Kong, Connect: The World of Critical Care Nursing, 2, pp. 91-93, (2004); Lum S., SARS crisis: United in courage, Pi Iota Newsletter, 6, (2003); McNaught C., Using narrative to explore the relationships between crisis, innovation and pedagogy, Education Research Journal, 18, pp. 111-124, (2003); Perkins J.M., Blyler N., Narrative and Professional Communication., (1999); Riley T., Hawe P., Researching practice: The methodological case for narrative inquiry, Health Education Research, 20, pp. 226-236, (2004); SARS in Hong Kong: From Experience to Action., (2003); Strauss A., Corbin J., Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Procedures and Techniques., (1990); Tomlinson B., Cockram C., SARS: Experience at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, Lancet, 361, pp. 1486-1487, (2003); Tsang K.W., Ho P.L., Oi G., A cluster of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong, New England Journal of Medicine, 345, pp. 1977-1985, (2003); Wong G.W., Hui D.S.C., Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): Epidemiology, diagnosis and management (editorial), Thorax, 58, pp. 558-560, (2003); (2004)","E.

Ensuring equivalence of a translated Chinese version of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire is an important prerequisite for identifying culturally specific expressions of concepts under investigation and for cross-cultural comparisons. This paper examines the principles and procedures for determining equivalence of translated tools and their application to the development of an equivalent Chinese version of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. Translation and back-translation were used to develop a Chinese version of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. Bilingual university students completed both versions of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. Most of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire items had an acceptable Kappa of >0·4. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated moderate to high levels of equivalence for total scores and all scales. Improvement in the translation of some items is needed to further enhance the equivalence of the Chinese version of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire.","Chinese; Equivalence; Measurement; Menstrual distress questionnaire; Methodology; Premenstrual syndrome; Translation","Adult; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Over Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Premenstrual Syndrome; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Statistics, Nonparametric; Translating; adult; article; cross-sectional study; crossover procedure; cultural factor; female; Hong Kong; human; language; methodology; nonparametric test; premenstrual syndrome; psychological aspect; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; retrospective study","","","","","","","Bracken B.A., Barona A., State of the art procedures for translating, validating and using psychoeducational tests in cross cultural assessment, School Psychology International, 12, 1-2, pp. 119-132, (1991); Brislin R.W., Back-translation for cross-cultural research, Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology, 1, 3, pp. 185-216, (1970); Candell G.L., Hulin C.L., Cross-language and cross-cultural comparisons in scale translations: Independent sources of information about item nonequivalence, Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology, 17, 4, pp. 417-440, (1986); Chapman D.W., Carter J.F., Translation procedures for the cross-cultural use of measurement instruments, Education Evaluation and Public Analysis, 1, 3, pp. 71-76, (1979); Cohen J., Weighted kappa.

Hlth. and Epidemiology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom","Background. Compared with other countries, Hong Kong has a relatively high rate of cervical cancer. Much of this morbidity should be avoidable with cervical screening, but uptake rates for screening in Hong Kong are low. In programmes to promote cervical screening attendance, it is essential that aspects of the socio-cultural system be taken into account to provide appropriate preventive health strategies. Aim. This paper outlines an investigation of the cultural and social factors contributing to Chinese women's attendance for cervical screening. Method. A mixed methods design was employed, combining and comparing two data sets. The initial data set was drawn from 10 focus groups involving both screened and unscreened Chinese women (n = 54). The second data set was drawn from a total population of Hong Kong doctors, and involved face-to-face semi-structured interviews (n = 28). Results. Thematic analysis of the data from women indicated that the social factors of cost, educational base, knowledge of risk, the social value of early detection and cultural issues such as modesty and embarrassment contributed to screening attendance. The doctors perceived a cultural tendency towards fatalism, as well as seeing the gender, interpersonal and interprofessional skills of the practitioner to be important in influencing levels of Chinese women's shyness and discomfort, and hence affecting attendance. The lay and practitioner data sets varied in the perceptions of women's pain, embarrassment and risk factors. Conclusion. Programmes providing services for Chinese women need to ensure that the philosophy of the staff and the approach and materials used are culturally relevant. Recommendations are that nurses equipped with relevant social and cultural knowledge of population groups should have a central role in health promotion and screening services.","Cervical screening; Chinese women;

A total population of 37 Chinese men and women, residing in Hong Kong who had donated bone marrow to an unrelated recipient were interviewed and asked their retrospective perceptions and experiences during the process of unrelated bone marrow donation. The majority was female (60%) and single (59.3%). The median age was 30.9 years. The main themes drawn from thematic content analysis included: association with bad and good fortune, religious concerns associated with complete bodies, barriers posed by the extended family, fulfilling personal identities linked to perceptions of altruism, reciprocity and generosity and the differences between the expectations and reality of the experience of bone marrow donation. These accounts indicate how, for Chinese populations, the act of body fluid donation cannot be isolated from the experiences of life-long immersion in the dominant social and cultural processes of the time. In addition, Confucian notions of the body, the power of body fluids to pollute, the importance of blood and bones as sources of vital energy and the process of bodily transference into the after life are highlighted. Furthermore, what is also identifiably Chinese is that donation is more of a self-fulfilling act than a social act with very little familial or social recognition being accorded in the public world. The conclusion highlights how donors entered into the decision to donate with little awareness of the long-term consequences. The process, however, was seen by the donors to be beneficial. A compelling argument is made for more educational and emotional support regarding the experience of bone marrow donation from Hong Kong's formal service providers.

Methods: This two-phase study adopted a mixed-method design with Donadedian's model as the theoretical framework. In Phase One, a random sample of 40 Chinese women was invited to complete a questionnaire after attending a childbirth education class. The questionnaire was focused on their satisfaction with specific aspects of the class. Descriptive statistics were performed to summarize participants' response. In Phase Two, six of the original 40 women were purposively selected for a semi-structured interview pertaining to the perceived effect of the childbirth education class on their labour experience. Thematic analysis was conducted on the interview data. Findings: The participants expressed overall satisfaction with the class. The area that satisfied them the most was the performance of the midwife. The areas that satisfied them the least were the date, length, size and time of the class. Three themes emerged from the interview data, namely, 'learning about labour', 'contributing to a smooth labour process' and 'coping with uncertainty and handling anxiety. Conclusion: This study supports using a mixed-method approach to evaluate client education activity, and highlights the importance of cultivating positive coping measures among the Chinese women after attending childbirth education class when facing childbirth-related anxiety. © 2009 International Council of Nurses.","Childbirth education class; Chinese women; Donadedian's model; Hong kong; Mixed-method study","Adult; Emotions; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hong Kong; Humans; Midwifery; Parturition; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Satisfaction; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult; adult; article; attitude to health; birth; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; emotion; ethnology; female; Hong Kong; human; methodology; midwife; patient education; patient satisfaction; pregnancy; psychological aspect; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial; socioeconomics","","","","","","","Armstrong E.M., Lessons in control: Prenatal education in the hospital, Social Problems, 47, pp. 583-606, (2000); Bond M.H., Beyond the Chinese Face., (1991); 2006 Population Bi-Census - Summary Results., (2006); De Vries C.A., De Vries R.G., Childbirth education in the 21st century: An immodest proposal, The Journal of Perinatal Education, 16, pp. 38-48, (2007); Donabedian A., The Definition of Quality and Approaches to Its Assessment., (1980); Edwards N.P., Birthing Autonomy: Women's Experiences of Planning Home Births., (2005); Gibbins J., Thomson A.M., Women's expectations and experiences of childbirth, Midwifery, 17, pp. 302-313, (2001); Hallgren A., Kihlgren M., Norberg A., Forslin L., Women's perceptions of childbirth and childbirth education before and after education and birth, Midwifery, 11, pp. 130-137, (1995); Ho I., Holroyd E., Chinese women's perceptions of the effectiveness of antenatal education in the preparation of motherhood, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 38, 1, pp. 74-85, (2002); Holroyd E., Fung K.L., Lam S.C., Sin W.H., Doing the month: An exploration of postpartum practices in Chinese women, Journal of Healthcare for Women International, 18, pp. 301-315, (1997); Koehn M., Contemporary women's perceptions of childbirth education, Journal of Perinatal Education, 17, 1, pp. 11-18, (2008); Leininger M., Transcultural Nursing: Concepts, Theories, Research and Practices, 3rd Edn., (2002); Leung E., An evaluation on antenatal education programme: From the client's perspective, Evidence Based Nursing Practice Project (1)., (1996); Lothian J.A., Choice, autonomy, and childbirth education, Journal of Perinatal Education, 17, 1, pp. 35-38, (2008); Lumley J., Brown S., Attenders and non-attenders at childbirth education classes in Australia: How do they and their births differ?, Birth, 20, pp. 123-130, (1993); Malata A., Hauck Y., Monterosso L., McCaul K., Development and evaluation of a childbirth education programme for Malawian women, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 60, 1, pp. 67-78, (2007); Nolan M.L., Antenatal education failing to educate for parenthood, British Journal of Midwifery, 5, pp. 21-26, (1997); O'Meara C.M., A diagnostic model for the evaluation of childbirth and parenting education, Midwifery, 9, pp. 28-34, (1993); O'Meara C.M., An evaluation of consumer perspectives of childbirth and parenting education, Midwifery, 9, pp. 210-219, (1993); Perry M., Prenatal education - How effective is it?, Australian College of Midwives, 5, pp. 15-20, (1992); Polit D.F., Beck C.T., Essentials of Nursing Research: Methods, Appraisal, and Utilization, 6th Edn., (2006); Rumbold A.R., Cunningham J., A review of the impact of antenatal care for Australian Indigenous women and attempts to strengthen these services, Maternal and Child Health Journal, 12, pp. 83-100, (2008); Schmied V., Myors K., Wills J., Cooke M., Preparing expectant couples for new-parent experiences: A comparison of two models of antenatal education, Journal of Perinatal Education, 11, 3, pp. 20-27, (2002); Stamler L.L., The participants' views of childbirth education: Is there congruency with an enablement framework for patient education?, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 28, pp. 939-947, (1998); Sturrock W.A., Johnson J.A., The relationship between childbirth education classes and obstetric outcome, Birth, 17, pp. 82-85, (1990); Tadaharu O., Et al., Effectiveness of antenatal depression about postnatal depression: A comparison of two groups of Japanese mothers, Journal of Mental Health, 67, pp. 191-198, (1998); Timm M.M., Prenatal education evaluation, Nursing Research, 28, pp. 338-342, (1979); Walker D.S., Worrell R., Promoting healthy pregnancies through perinatal groups: A comparison of CenteringPregnancy Group Prenatal Care and childbirth education classes, Journal of Perinatal Education, 17, 1, pp. 27-34, (2008); Wiener A., Rogers C., Antenatal classes: Women can't think beyond labour, British Journal of Midwifery, 16, pp. 121-124, (2008)","L.

A total population of 68 patients with cardiac diseases provided the patient sample for structured telephone interviews. From these 68 patients, a convenience sample of five patients and their main carer provided the sample for semi-structured interviews. The results highlight the consistency of findings obtained from multiple methods of data collection, the type of contributions, complexity of classifying nursing contributions into specific domains of nursing practice and the perceptions of nurses, patients and carers of these contributions.

Design: a qualitative exploratory design. Setting: a postnatal ward of a private hospital in Hong Kong. Participants: a purposive sample of six postnatal women who had undergone an elective caesarean section. Findings: four thematic categories were identified including: avoiding fetal and maternal risks, exercising autonomy to make an independent choice, Chinese belief systems, and rejoicing and regretting. Key conclusions and implications for practice: we propose the provision of a 'named' midwife and continuity of care. Improving the availability of information on caesarean sections, accommodating a Chinese belief system in the planning of midwifery services at the international level and establishing post caesarean section peer support groups are recommended. © 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.","","Adult;

A self administered questionnaire comprised of 6 different domains, focusing on health behavior, environment and lifestyles was administered to a total sample of 89 FSWs, in addition, one focus group was conducted. The mean age of the FSWs interviewed was 36.1 years with the majority having received no more than junior high school education. Sixty-eight women (76.4%) had been in Hong Kong for less than one year and 35 (39.3%) for less than three months. A total of 14 (15.7%) of the women reported being robbed and verbally abused by client respectively. Furthermore, 7 (7.9%) of the women had been beaten by clients. A number of women (12.4%) had been insulted by passers-by. Many women felt physically unsafe and 18 (20.2%) reported only receiving irregular payment. Recommendations are to promote FSW peer education and empowerment and to address the complex stigmatization and victimization that operates for FSW. It is paramount to address the complexity of mental health risks and costs in relation to commercial sex which are further compounded by underlying factors of poverty, illegal statuses, marginalization, ethnicity and uncertainty so informing anxiety and depression outcomes. © 2007 Brill.

Donation decisions for families take place within an intricate web of tragedy, technology and uncertainty. Families' feelings about death, religious preferences and their attitudes towards organ donation greatly influence their experience of the decision-making on donation. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore Hong Kong cadaveric donor families' experience in the process of decision-making within a Chinese cultural framework. Methods: Convenience sampling was used. Twenty-nine donor families were drawn from the list of the Transplant Coordination Service at four Hong Kong public hospitals. Inclusion criteria were Cantonese-speaking Chinese residing in Hong Kong, who gave their consent to donate their relatives' organ. The donor families were asked on their retrospective perceptions and experience during and after the decision-making. Results: Thirteen participants were recruited and given a semi-structured interview. All the participants were female. The family relationships to the donors were wives, mothers, daughters and siblings. They had given consent to the organ donation. These families' experience of the donation procedure included an inability to comprehend brain death, confusion, stress and uncertainty. The informational and emotional needs were also stressed in donor families during and after donation, while emotional issues after donation were clearly identified. Conclusion: Among Hong Kong Chinese families that offer organ donation, decision-making is influenced by deeply embedded Chinese beliefs. It is recommended that healthcare professionals should have cultural sensitivity and competence in assisting donation discussions in order to meet their patients' needs, increase confidence and assure donor families during and after the decision-making process on organ donation.","Brain death; Donor family; Health professional; Hong Kong Chinese; Organ donation","adult; article; brain death; cadaver donor; Chinese; competence; confusion; cultural factor; daughter; decision making; emotion; experience; family; family relation; female; health practitioner; health service; Hong Kong; human; human needs; informed consent; language; mother; perception; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; public hospital; religion; sampling; semi structured interview; sibling; spouse; stress; uncertainty","","","","","","","Hawkins B.R., Current status of organ transplantation in Hong Kong, Transplantation Proc, 28, pp. 1190-1192, (1996); General Household Survey: Topic E: Organ Donation, (1995); Yeung I., Kong S.H., Lee J., Attitudes towards organ donation in Hong Kong, Soc Sci Med, 50, pp. 1643-1654, (2000); Ho S., Cheng B., Overview of transplant co-ordination service in Hong Kong, Hong Kong J Nephrol, 1, pp. 68-70, (1999); Yong B.H., Cheng B., Ho S., Refusal of consent for organ donation: From survey to bedside, Transplant Proc, 32, (2000); Buckley T.A., The shortage of solid organs for transplantation in Hong Kong: Part of a worldwide problem, Hong Kong Med J, 6, pp. 399-408, (2000); Burroughs T.E., Hong B.A., Kappel D.F., Freedman B.K., The stability of family decisions to consent or refuse organ donation: Would you do it again, Psychosom Med, 60, pp. 156-162, (1998); DeJong W., Franz H.G., Wolfe S.M., Nathan H., Payne D., Reitsma W., Et al., Requesting organ donation: An interview study of donor and nondonor families, Am J Crit Care, 7, pp. 13-23, (1998); Siminoff L.A., Gordon N., Hewlett J., Arnold R., Factors influencing families' consent for donation of solid organs for transplantation, JAMA, 286, pp. 71-77, (2001); Buckley P.E., The delicate question of the donor family, Transplantation Proc, 21, pp. 1411-1412, (1989); Haddow G., Donor and nondonor families' account of communication and relations with healthcare professionals, Prog Transplant, 14, pp. 41-48, (2004); Pelletier M., The organ donor family members' perception of stressful situation during the organ donation experience, J Adv Nurs, 17, pp. 90-97, (1992); Pelletier M.L., The needs of family members of organ and tissue donors, Heart Lung, 22, pp. 151-157, (1993); Sque M., Payne S.A., Dissonant loss: The experience of donor relatives, Soc Sci Med, 43, pp. 1359-1370, (1996); La Spina F., Sedda L., Pizzi C., Verlato R., Candiani A., Chiaranda M., Et al., Donor families' attitude toward organ donation, Transplant Proc, 25, pp. 1699-1701, (1993); Shih F.J., Lai M.K., Lin M.H., Lin H.Y., Tsao C.I., Duh B.R., Et al., The dilemma of ""to-be or not-to-be"": Needs and expectations of the Taiwanese cadaveric organ donor families during the pre-donation transition, Soc Sci Med, 53, pp. 693-706, (2001); Shih F.J., Lai M.K., Lin M.H., Lin H.Y., Tsao C.I., Chou L.L., Et al., Impact of cadaveric organ donation on Taiwanese donor families during the first 6 months after donation, Psychosom Med, 63, pp. 69-78, (2001); Lee I.Y.M., Chien W.T., Mackenzine A.E., Needs of families with a relative in a critical care unit in Hong Kong, J Clin Nurs, 9, pp. 46-54, (2000); Verble M., Worth J., Cultural sensitivity in the donation discussion, Prog Transplant, 13, pp. 33-37","T.Y.

Design: Cross-section survey of female street sex workers in Hong Kong. The questionnaire contained questions regarding quality of life, health status, working environment, suicide ideation, mental health, as well as other personal and family characteristics. A number of statistical models were used to analyze this rich set of cross-sectional data. Results: More than a quarter of the women surveyed reported to have considered or attempted suicide, nevertheless the specific timing of their suicide attempts was unclear. Accounting for background characteristics, factors that were inherent to the sex industry were significantly associated with poor psychological health and suicidality. Experience of stigma and previous employment experience prior to involvement in sex work were also highly correlated with increased incidence of suicide attempts. On the other hand, the presence of dependents and experience of social support were associated with lower probability of suicidality. Conclusion: Our study suggests that a number of areas (e.g., increased emphasis on health education and promotion, self-esteem building, assertiveness training and client advocacy) warrant attention among health professionals practicing in the Asian region, particularly among mental health nurses. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

An in-depth ethnographic approach was used to draw on a convenience sample of 20 elderly wives who were caregivers from Hong Kong. At the conceptual level, the discussion highlights how caregiving is rooted in complex, culturally-based models of contemporary practices, sociohistoric patterns, and gender-specific obligations. The key themes identified were marital duty-bound roles and responsibilities, reciprocity and burden, public guidelines and upholding reputations as Chinese wives, monetary restrictions, affection as an emotional force to sustain caregiving, effects of the caregiving role, and the creation of self-identity through caregiving. The model proposed for interpreting elderly Chinese wives' caregiving obligations highlights the tension-filled links between Confucianism and government guidelines, early and ongoing socializing experiences, and self-identity. © 2005 Sage Publications.","Caregiving; Chinese; Cultural models; Elderly; Wives","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anthropology, Cultural; Attitude to Health; Caregivers; China; Conflict (Psychology); Confucianism; Cost of Illness; Cultural Characteristics; Female; Gender Identity; Home Nursing; Hong Kong; Humans; Love; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Moral Obligations; Nursing Methodology Research; Questionnaires; Self Concept; Social Responsibility; Socialization; Socioeconomic Factors; Spouses; Women; age distribution; aged; article; caregiver; Chinese; controlled study; cultural factor; emotion; female; government; health care; Hong Kong; human; identity; model; practice guideline; religion; responsibility","","","","","","","Anderson R., Bury M., Living with Chronic Illness: The Experience of Patients and Their Families, (1988); Bowers B.J., Intergenerational caregiving, adult caregivers and their ageing parents, Advanced Nursing Science, 9, pp. 20-31, (1987); Chai C., Chai W., Confucius: Li Chi Book of Rites, (1967); Chow N.S.W., Ageing in Hong Kong, Social Issues in Hong Kong, pp. 165-177, (1990); Croll E., Changing Identities of Chinese Women, Rhetoric, Experience and Self-perception in Twentieth-century China, (1995); D'Andrade R.G., Strauss C., Human Motives and Cultural Models, (1992); Finch J., Family Obligations and Social Change, (1989); Finch J., Mason J., Negotiating Family Responsibilities, (1993); Holland D., Quinn N., Cultural Models in Language and Thought, (1987); Holroyd E., Hong Kong Chinese daughters' intergenerational caregiving obligations: A cultural model approach, Social Science and Medicine, 53, pp. 1125-1134, (2001); Holroyd E., Health-seeking behaviors and social change: The experience of the Hong Kong Chinese elderly, Qualitative Health Research, 12, pp. 731-750, (2002); Holroyd E., Chinese cultural influences on parental caregiving obligations toward children with disabilities, Qualitative Health Research, 13, pp. 4-19, (2003); Holroyd E., Chinese family obligations towards chronically ill elderly members: Comparing caregivers in Beijing and Hong Kong, Qualitative Health Research, 13, pp. 302-318, (2003); Holroyd E., Hong Kong Chinese family caregiving: Cultural categories of bodily order and the location of self, Qualitative Health Research, 13, pp. 158-170, (2003); Holroyd E.A., Chinese Family Caregivers: Dilemmas at the Extremity of Public and Private Obligations, (1998); White Paper on Social Welfare in the 1990s and Beyond, (1991); Green Paper on Services for the Elderly, (1997); Ikels C.P., Hong Kong, The Ageing Experience: Diversity and Commonality Across Cultures, pp. 83-100, (1994); Jankowiak W.R., Sex, Death and Hierarchy in a Chinese City, (1993); Kwok A., Community-based Rehabilitation and People and Mental Retardation and Their Families and Communities in Hong Kong, (1991); La Fontaine J.S., Person and individual: Some anthropological reflections, The Category of the Person, pp. 123-140, (1984); Mauss M., The Gift: Form and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies, (1967); Morse J.M., Qualitative Nursing Research: A Contemporary Dialogue, (1991); Ngan R., Cheng I.C.K., The caring dilemma: Stress and needs of caregivers for the Chinese frail elderly, Hong Kong Journal of Gerontology, 6, 2, pp. 34-41, (1992); Nolan M., Grant G., Addressing the needs of informal carers: Neglected area of nursing practice, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 14, pp. 950-961, (1989); Rosen S., Mei Foo Sun Chuen: Middle-class Chinese Families in Transition, (1976); Strauss A., Corbin J., Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Approaches and Techniques, (1990); Yanagisako S.J., Transforming the Past: Tradition and Kinship among Japanese Americans, (1985); Yang M.M., Gifts, Favors and Banquets: The Art of Social Relationships in China, (1994)","","","","","","","","","01939459","","","15870240","English","West.

The donors demonstrated better mood states in terms of anger-hostility and fatigue compared to non-donors. However, their self-esteem was low (similarly to the non-donors), they did not see themselves as a better person as a result of the donation and they thought they did an act somewhat more generously than usual. This is possibly attributed to the cultural influences of normative obligation. The majority (57.9%) believed that they were not prepared well for the donation, and 40% found the experience emotionally less positive than they expected. Some found the experience physically stressful (10.5%) and some others were worried that their future health may be affected as a result of the donation (15.8%). Although a quarter of the donors was unsure whether they would donate again or whether they would encourage others to donate, the majority would donate again. Such results demonstrate that donors need careful and individualised attention in order to gain a more positive overall experience of the donation. Furthermore, services should be more vigilant in assessing donor needs and intervening when donors experience difficulties due to the donation process.","Bone marrow; Chinese; Donor; Unrelated","adjustment; adult; anger; article; bone marrow transplantation; Chinese; clinical article; donor; fatigue; female; hostility; human; male; mood; priority journal; self esteem; social psychology","","","","","Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK","We would like to thank the staff in the Hong Kong Marrow Match Foundation for their invaluable assistance and the donors who shared their experiences with us.

The SCS was developed to measure learned resourcefulness, which facilitates people's coping under adversity. Promoting learned resourcefulness in childbearing women facilitates positive adaptation to motherhood, which is essential to both maternal and child health. Thus, a reliable and valid C-SCS is crucial for the development of interventions to promote learned resourcefulness in Chinese childbearing women. In phase one, the SCS was translated into Chinese using the technique of translation and back-translation and was reviewed by an expert panel for cultural equivalence. In phase two, psychometric testing of the C-SCS was conducted by using a convenience sample of 360 childbearing women recruited from an antenatal clinic of a regional hospital. Four instruments including the C-SCS, General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and Edinburgh's Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were administered to the participants. Ninety-two women participated in the four-week retest. The C-SCS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0·83) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0·91). Factor analysis revealed the presence of three factors supporting the conceptual dimension of the original instrument. Significant correlations with GSE (r = 0·48, p < 0·01), RSES (r = 0·41, p < 0·01) and EPDS (r = -0·46, p < 0·01) demonstrated good construct validity. The findings suggest that the C-SCS is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring learned resourcefulness in Chinese childbearing women. The C-SCS provides midwives with a useful tool in the evaluation of interventions designed to strengthen Chinese women's learned resourcefulness and promote maternal well-being during childbearing. © 2007 The Authors.

It reveals how differences in socioeconomic profile and organisational hierarchies amongst different groups of sex workers create different barriers to condom use. Data was collected by means of field observation of entertainment venues and in-depth interviews. Findings suggest that, compared with other sex workers, street-walkers are less likely to use condoms with their clients, hold highly disadvantaged socioeconomic profiles and work in isolation. Major barriers to condom use link to economic deprivation and threats of violence from clients. For the women working in entertainment venues, drunkenness of clients, pricing mechanisms and familiarity with clients pose barriers to condom use. Yet within all these constraints women are not powerless and instead find ways to exercise agency and gain personal protection and economic advantage. In the newly emerging China, both structural hierarchies of work and individual agency inform condom use by female sex workers. Future HIV intervention programmes need to take these factors into account in order to meet the needs of different groups of women sex workers.","China; Condom use; Poverty; Power; Sex work","Adolescent; Adult; China; Condoms; Cultural Characteristics; Female; Humans; Poverty; Power (Psychology); Prostitution; Risk-Taking; Sexual Behavior; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Social Control, Informal; Unsafe Sex; Urban Population; Women's Health; Women, Working; adolescent; adult; article; China; condom; controlled study; drunkenness; female; human; information processing; interview; observational study; poverty; powerlessness; preventive health service; priority journal; prostitution; sexual behavior; socioeconomics; threat; violence","","","","","Department of Sociology, University of Alabama at Birmingham; Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK","We are thankful to the Department of Sociology and the Faculty of Social Science of the Chinese University of Hong Kong for providing financial support for this research.

Bodily disorder was a starting point from which to locate identifiably Chinese attempts to restore disrupted family relations. Themes included bodies out of order-challenging Confucian-informed models of family obligation; controlling bodily excretions; the body in decay; and the body as the location of self. The management of bodily order by Chinese caregivers provides a cultural category in which personal experiences are ordered as public matters within specific local contexts. Caregivers dealt with both the demands of bodily needs and the imperative to maintain a social relationship. The establishment of bodily and self-order reflects a Chinese social system whereby moral duties are located primarily in kinship. The author summarizes culturally specific ways in which health professionals working with Chinese families involved in long-term care can target assessment and interventions before the onset of physical and emotional deterioration. © 2003 Sage Publications.","Body; Caregiving; Chinese; Family; Order self","Aged; Caregivers; Confucianism; Culture; Family Relations; Home Nursing; Hong Kong; Human Body; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Interviews; Qualitative Research; article; caregiver; Chinese; cultural anthropology; elderly care; emotion; ethnographic research; excretion; family relation; health care personnel; Hong Kong; human; interview; long term care; morality; physical disability; priority journal; religion; self concept; society; aged; art; cultural anthropology; ethnology; home care; human relation; psychological aspect; qualitative research","","","","","","","Chu G.C., The changing concept of self in contemporary China, Culture and Self: Asian and Western Perspectives, pp. 252-278, (1995); Collins R., On the microfoundations of macrosociology, American Journal of Sociology, 86, 5, pp. 984-1014, (1981); Human Motives and Cultural Models, (1992); Douglas M., Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo, (1966); Holroyd E.A., Chinese Family Caregivers: Dilemmas at the Extremity of Public and Private Obligations, (1998); Ikels C., Hong Kong, The Aging Experience: Diversity and Commonality Across Cultures, pp. 83-100, (1994); Kelly M.P., Field D., Medical sociology, chronic illness and the body, Sociology of Health and Illness, 18, 2, pp. 241-257, (1996); Kleinman A.K., Kleinman J., Moral transformation of health and suffering in Chinese society, Morality and Health, pp. 109-119, (1997); Kwan A.Y.H.K., A Study of Coping Behaviours of Caregivers in Hong Kong, (1991); Marsella A., Devos G., Hsu F.L.K., Culture and Self: Asian and Western Perspectives, (1985); Ngan R., Cheng I.C.K., The caring dilemma: Stress and needs of caregivers of the Chinese frail elderly, Hong Kong Journal of Gerontology, 6, 2, pp. 34-41, (1992); Watson J.L., Funeral specialists in Cantonese society: Pollution, performance, and social hierarchy, Death Ritual in Late Imperial and Modern China, pp. 109-134, (1988)","","","","","","","","","15527557","","QHREE","12643026","English","Qual.

This article focuses on specific gender and culturally related experiences of Chinese women presenting for Papancolaou (Pap) tests. The first phase of a descriptive exploratory study involved the administration of a questionnaire to a total population of female Hong Kong Chinese clerical and technical staff working in academic departments of a tertiary institution. The second phase consisted of in-depth semistructured interviews with a purposive sample of women to explore experiences of Pap smear screening. Of these women, 68.2% associated pain with a Pap smear. In addition, 78.6% of the women associated a Pap smear with embarrassment. Older women were more likely to experience pain and embarrassment during the procedure. In the qualitative data, women's personal images and experiences reflected four subthemes including pain, sexual connotations of the procedure, vulnerability, and diminished embarrassment after childbirth. The second substantive theme, characteristics of the practitioner, highlighted the importance of procedural, interpersonal, and culturally sensitive skills, particularly in respect to information-giving and interaction with women. The conclusion outlines the nursing implications for Chinese women presenting for Pap smears in terms of cultural sensitivity as a means of enhancing attendance patterns.","Chinese women; Experiences; Pap smear","adult; article; Chinese; cultural anthropology; female; human; interview; morbidity; mortality; nursing; Papanicolaou test; priority journal; questionnaire; self concept; uterine cervix cancer","","","","","","","Marin G., Marin B.V., Research With Hispanic Populations, (1991); Sabagal F.G., Marin R., Otero-Sabogal B.V., Perez-Stable E.J., Hispanic familism and acculturation: What changes and what doesn't?, Hispanic J Behav Sci, 9, pp. 397-412, (1987); Sandoval M.C., De la Roza M.C., A cultural perspective for serving the Hispanic client, pp. 151-181, (1986); Mo B., Modesty, sexuality, and breast health in Chinese American women, 157, pp. 260-264, (1993); Croll E., Changing Identities of Chinese Women: Rhetoric, Experience and Self-Perception in Twentieth-Century China, (1995); Confucius, Chi L., Book of Rites, (1967); Wolf M., The woman who didn't become a shaman, Am Ethnol, 17, 3, pp. 419-430, (1990); Temple-Smith M.J., Banwell C.L., Gifford S.M., Presswell N.T., Promoting health beyond recruitment: Beliefs and attitudes to breast and cervical cancer screening services among Italian-born women in Melbourne, Health Promotion J Aust, 5, 2, pp. 31-36, (1995); Seow A., Wong M.L., Smith W.C.S., Lee H.P., Beliefs and attitudes as determinants of cervical cancer screening: A community-based study in Singapore, Prev Med, 24, pp. 134-141, (1985); Ward J., D'Este C., Sanson-Fisher R., Beyond opportunistic Pap smears in general practice: Women's view of strategies to promote regular screening, Fam Physician, 22, 11, pp. 2032-2034, (1993); Yu C.K.H., Rymer J., Women's attitudes to and awareness of smear testing and cervical cancer, Br J Fam Plan, 23, pp. 127-133, (1998); Mitchell H., Pap smear collected by nurse practitioners: A comparison with smears collected by medical practitioners, Oncol Nurs Forum, 20, 5, pp. 807-810, (1993); Mckie L., Women's views of the cervical smear test: Implications for nursing practice: Women who have not had a smear test, J Adv Nurs, 18, pp. 972-979, (1993); Johnston G., Orbell S., Crombie I., Robertson A., Kenicer M., Women's preferences for cervical screening: Who, where, and when, Health Educ J, 55, pp. 84-91, (1996); Twinn S., Cheng F., A case study of the effectiveness of nurse-led screening programme for cervical cancer among Hong Kong Chinese women, J Adv Nurs, 29, 5, pp. 1089-1096, (1999); Adab P., Hedley A.J., Preventing avoidable death: The case of cervical cancer in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Med J, 3, 4, pp. 427-432, (1998); Herbert A., Is cervical screening working?

This ethnographic study explored the perceptions and moral determinants of caregiving from the personal accounts of primary caregivers in 10 Beijing families. Analysis generated themes of labor and routines of caregiving, restricted resources, health, and illness, linked by the sentiment of establishing a connection, family time, personal time, gendered time, and reciprocity. For these Beijing families, caregivers accorded and enacted caregiving based on diffuse sentimental and behavioral as well as cultural guidelines drawing on the nature and quality of the relationship, past patterns of exchange, and a clear sense of who was most able to provide care and why.

Accordingly, the physical and psychological health of sex workers is becoming an increasing concern for the workers themselves, the public, and government policy. Methods: A cross-sectional survey on the quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life [WHOQOL]) of female sex workers (FSWs) in Hong Kong was used to investigate the physical and psychological well-being of street FSWs, and the results were compared with those of nonsex-working Hong Kong women after adjusting for age, educational level, marital status, and health status. Results: The 89 FSWs surveyed scored significantly lower on QOL-WHOQOL-BREF (HK) - measures compared with the nonsex-working women. One common aspect among these sex workers was their negative view of themselves and of life. Many sex workers were at risk of being abused while at work, and many women worked without legal protection. Most of the women surveyed engaged in sex work to support their families. Because their income was often insufficient, some of their needs, especially those concerning health, were often neglected. Conclusions: The low WHOQOL-BREF (HK) scores in FSWs indicate feelings of helplessness and entrapment, which may well result in detrimental effects on sex workers' health, self-esteem, and confidence when asserting their basic rights, such as access to healthcare and safety. The conclusion highlights the vulnerability of this population to apparent weaknesses in Hong Kong's current healthcare system. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Adult; Attitude to Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Behavior; Health Status; Hong Kong; Humans; Prostitution; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Self Concept; Socioeconomic Factors; Women, Working; abuse; adult; age; article; controlled study; education; family; female; health care; health care access; health care system; health status; helplessness; high risk population; Hong Kong; human; human rights; income; legal aspect; marriage; mental health; occupational hazard; occupational safety; priority journal; prostitution; quality of life; self concept; self esteem; sexual health; vulnerable population; wellbeing; women's health; world health organization","","","","","","","Chan M.K.T., Ho K.M., Lo K.K., A behavior sentinel surveillance for female sex workers in the Social Hygiene Service in Hong Kong (1999-2000), Int J STD AIDS, 13, (2002); Population by sex, 2003, (2004); Abdullah A.S.M., Cross-border travel and HIV/AIDS risk among travelers in Hong Kong, (1996); Lau J.T., Thomas J., Risk behaviors of Hong Kong male residents traveling to mainland China: A potential bridge population for HIV infection, AIDS Care, 13, (2001); Wong W.C.W., Wun Y.T., The health of female sex workers in Hong Kong: Do we care?, Hong Kong Med J, 9, (2003); Vanwesenbeeck I., Another decade of social scientific work on sex work: A review of research 1990-2000, Annu Rev Sex Res, 12, (2001); Wong K.H., Lee S.S., Lo Y.C., Lo K.K., Condom use among female commercial sex workers and male clients in Hong Kong, Int J STD & AIDS, 5, (1994); Abdullah A.S., Fielding R., Hedley A.J., Hong Kong: An epicenter of increasing risk for HIV transmission?

This study sought to identify Chinese women's cultural beliefs and behaviors related ""doing the month"" and suggest how these are modified in the light of contemporary realties and experiences within the context of rapid social change. Ethnographic interview data was gathered by means of a telephone interviews (postnatally) with 100 eligible primiparous women who had attended hospital based antenatal programmes. The analysis highlighted a range of issues for these predominately middle class women which included special postpartum dietary beliefs and behaviours including the avoidance of hot and cold food, the restorative powers of food, wind and water prohibitions, food proscriptions and prohibitions during breast feeding, the cultural imperative of timing and contemporary autonomy of women versus conforming to female centered kinship obligations. It is concluded that health professionals working with Chinese women need further awareness of the cultural significance of adherence to postnatal practices and their fundamental links to the health status of postpartum women, and family relationships. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

A concurrent cross sectional survey design used a snowball method of recruitment was used because of the acknowledged problematic access to a random sample of immigrant women. A total of 98 female domestic helpers were actively recruited through designated recreation centers. The women were between 24-45 years old (mean = 37.9, SD = 7.7). The majority of these women were employed as full-time domestic helpers (91%), were earning less than $4000 Hong Kong dollars/month (92%), were married (82%), with children (91%), were non-smokers (88%), and had at least a secondary level of education (100%), with 66% of these women having completed post-secondary education. While the majority of women had previously heard about cervical smears (78%) more than half (53%) reported never having a cervical smear taken. Women who had a prior cervical smear had significantly more knowledge about cervical smears and cervical cancer (mean = 51.34, SD = 2.5) than those who never had a cervical smear (mean = 49.72, SD = 3.2). Recommendations are made for culturally tailored mass screening programmers out of office hours and health information to be provided in both written and oral Tagalong. Doctors and nurse ideally of Filipino origin should be used to deliver health messages that prioritize the importance of self protection for the family and future fertility issues, culturally prized within Filipino society. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

In this article we report on a study using a modified grounded theory approach to analyse a series of semi-structured interviews with 49 female sex workers in Hong Kong, in order to examine the ways in which this group experiences and negotiates the stigma which arises from their employment in the sex industry. Sex workers in Hong Kong were subject to various stigmatising forces in their daily lives in their interactions with the public, the police and their families. These processes could have a negative impact on the sex workers' health, both through obvious manifestations such as physical or verbal abuse and through more subtle processes such as those which generated or perpetuated vulnerability and those which compelled the sex workers to conceal their identities and withdraw themselves from social networks. These findings are situated in the context of broader research surrounding sex work, drawing attention to the consequences of stigma on health and their interaction with health-service providers, before briefly discussing possible means of overcoming stigma-related barriers to providing adequate healthcare for this marginalised group. © 2010 The Authors.

The objectives were to shed light on adolescent experience and their understanding of intimate relationships, identify their knowledge of sex education and explore their sexual education needs. Design: A prospective survey design using mixed methods was employed. Subjects: A total of 28 adolescents were purposively recruited on the basis of age and sex from the YMCA in Hong Kong and 4 homogenous focus groups were subsequently conducted. In addition three individual face to face interviews were conducted. Main outcome measures/Results: A total of six gender-contrasting themes were found. These included: love and sexuality; the importance of appearance and body shape; feeling more positive after sex; the need for separate sex education classes, preferred sources of health information and sexual health needs. We found that both sexes felt that having the ""right person"" to deliver sex education was of crucial importance. For the girls the social pressures exerted by friends, fear of pregnancy after sex, and worry about sex without love were important topics. The girls expressed their need for further information on how to deal with social pressures, moral value clarification, the stigma of being seen to be sexually active and handling their disgust over pornography. In contrast the boys had little concern about pornography but did want to learn how to communicate and negotiate with the opposite sex. Conclusion: The differences found highlight the importance of approaching sexual health education from a cultural and gender perspective, in particular developing peer educator-led programmes to create normative support for early school leavers. Particular attention needs to be paid to the rapidly shifting and influential sources of adolescent sex education information such as the Internet and social groups.","Adolescents; Chinese; Gender; Sexual health","adolescent;

A case is presented for how the media not only reflect social images and views on ageing, but actively participate in the social construction of views about being old. Two newspapers in Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post (English medium) and the Sin Tao (Chinese medium), were surveyed and contents of stories depicting old age were analyzed, using a qualitative and quantitative methodological design. Dominant amongst the themes was vulnerability in old age. Newspapers used stories according to journalistic formulae to present both negative and positive depictions of old age; however, positive stories carried a sense of the exceptional rather than ordinary life. Results were analysed through a comparison between the two Hong Kong newspapers as well as a comparison with a similar study undertaken on the Australian print media.","Experience of old age; Media; Social construction of images; Stereotyped views","","","","","","","","Allinson R.E., Understanding the Chinese Mind, (1989); Berger P., Luckman T., The Social Construction of Reality, (1967); Bourdieu P., Social space and symbolic power, The Polity Reader in Social Theory, pp. 111-120, (1994); Chenitz C., Swanson C., From Practice to Grounded Theory, (1986); Chow N., The Chinese family and support of the elderly in Hong Kong, The Gerontologist, 23, 6, pp. 584-588, (1983); Chow N., Aging in Hong Kong, Social Issues in Hong Kong, pp. 164-178, (1992); Chow N., Kwan A., A Study of the Changing Lifestyle of the Elderly in Low Income Families in Hong Kong, (1986); Edgar P., The News in Focus: The Journalism of Exceptions, (1980); Fraser N., Unruly Practices: Power, Discourse and Gender in Contemporary Social Theory, (1989); Gibb H., The Role of Psychological Factors in the Processing of Metaphor, (1988); Gibb H., Representations of Old Age: Notes Towards a Critique and Revision of Ageism in Nursing Practice: DINR Monograph Series, (1990); Glaser B., Strauss A., The Discovery of Grounded Theory, (1967); Hall S., Encoding and Decoding in Television Discourse, (1973); Hughes H.M., News and the Human Interest Story, (1968); Kosberg J., Ethical and professional issues in determining the balance between family and public responsibility for the elderly, Conference Proceedings: International Conference on Family and Community Care, pp. 185-191, (1994); Lakoff G., Johnson M., Metaphors We Live by, (1980); Langer J., The structures and ideology of the 'other news' on television, The News in Focus: The Journalism of Exceptions, pp. 13-43, (1980); Leung B., Formation of a multidisciplinary team to deal with elderly abuse cases, Hong Kong Journal of Gerontology, 1, pp. 43-46, (1989); McCreey D., The Symbolism of Popular Taoist Magic, (1973); Munro D., The family network, the stream of water, the plant, picturing persons in Sung Confucianism, Individualism and Holism: The Confucian and Taoist Philosophical Perspectives, pp. 299-310, (1985); Ngan R., The availability of informal support networks to the Chinese elderly in Hong Kong and its implications for practice, Hong Kong Journal of Gerontology, 4, 2, pp. 19-25, (1990); Osgood C.E., Focus on Meaning: V 1.

Under the ""two countries, one system"" policy implemented by China to manage the return of Hong Kong's sovereignty, Hong Kong has maintained a comparatively prosperous economy within the Asian region. This has resulted in an environment which fosters migration from the mainland to Hong Kong, due largely to proximity, higher earning potential, common language, and a relaxing of border control measures. However not all mainland China citizens are equally able to access these new migration schemes and indeed a number of women such as sex workers are either migrating and/or working illegally and without occupational, legal and health protection within Hong Kong. Discussion. Female migrant sex workers are exposed to a number of significant threats to their health, however their illegal status contributes to even greater vulnerability. The prevailing discourses which view these women as either ""trafficked women"" or as ""illegal immigrants"" do not adequately account for the complex situations which result in such women's employment in Hong Kong's sex industry. Rather, their position can best be understood within the broader frameworks provided by migration literature and the concept of ""structural violence"". This allows for a greater understanding of the socio-political issues which are systematically denying migrant sex workers adequate access to health care and other opportunities for social advancement. When these issues are taken into account, it becomes clear that the current relevant legislation regarding both immigration and sex work is perpetuating the marginalised and vulnerable status of migrant sex workers. Unless changes are made, structural barriers will remain in place which impede the ability of migrant sex workers to manage their own health needs and status. Conclusion. Female migrant sex workers in Hong Kong are extremely vulnerable to a number of occupational health and safety hazards which have significantly detrimental effects on their health. These risks can best be understood within a broad framework of socio-political factors contributing to their vulnerability. Ensuring that migrant sex workers have adequate support for their health and legal rights requires require structural interventions such as decriminalisation and providing open and inclusive access to health service to counteract such factors. © 2008 Wong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Laidler K.J., Petersen C., Emerton R., Bureacratic Justice: The Incarceration of Mainland Chinese Women Working in Hong Kong's Sex Industry, Int J Offender Ther Comp Criminol, 51, pp. 68-83, (2007); Chan M.K., Ho K.M., Lo K.K., A behaviour sentinel surveillance for female sex workers in the social hygiene service in Hong Kong (1999 - 2000), Int J STD & AIDS, 13, pp. 815-20, (2002); Teng Z., Chinese migrant sex workers in Hong Kong, Research for Sex Work 9: Sex Work and Money, (2006); Holroyd E.A., Wong W.C.W., Gray A., Ling D., Female Sex Workers and occupational Health: A new role for nurses in Hong Kong, Int J Nurs Stud, (2008); Hong Kong Crimes Ordinance; Prostitutes' union protests after suicide' (15<sup>th</sup> October 2005), South China Post; Protests against treatment of caged suspects (18<sup>th</sup> June 2005), South China Post; Police investigate sex slave claims (11<sup>th</sup> March 2006), South China Post; Lee M., Women's Imprisonment as a Mechanism of Migration Control in Hong Kong, Brit J Criminol, 47, pp. 847-860, (2007); Hong Kong Immigration Ordinance; Yuet Y.L., Expanding from services to rights issues: The work of Zi Teng in Hong Kong, Exchange on HIV/AIDS, Sexuality and Gender, 1, pp. 5-7, (2007); Wong W.C.W., Gray A., Ling D., Holroyd E., Patterns of healthcare utilisation and health behaviours among street sex workers in Hong Kong, Health Policy, 77, pp. 140-8, (2006); ""letter to the Senate"", (2008); Trafficking in Persons Report, (2001); Nations U., Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; Nations U., Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, (2000); Collateral Damage: The Impact of Anti-Trafficking Measures on Human Rights Around the World.

The study focused on how men negotiated with the mainstream Chinese heterosexual society and in so doing constructed their sexual identities. The factors found to inform sexual identity were: the cultural imperative of heterosexual marriage, normative family obligations, desired gender roles, emotional experiences and a need for social belonging. The four types of sexual identities constructed included: establishing a deliberate non-homosexual identity, accumulating an individual homosexual identity, forming a collective homosexual identity and adopting a flexible sexual identity. For the men interviewed, sexual identity was both fluid and fragmented, derived from highly personalised negotiations between individualised needs and social and cultural constructs.

State College Boulevard, United States","Aim: This paper presents a Hong Kong (HK) data on the effect that sex work has on women's environmental health and safety. An outreach role that highlights safety and human rights is suggested for nurses working with female sex workers (FSWs) as clients. Background: In HK it was estimated that there were at least 200,000 FSWs in 2002 and the total population involved as workers, support staff, clients and partners of the clients exceeded half a million in a city of 6.8 million people. Despite these numbers, both locally and internationally there are very limited outreach nursing services that address the FSW's occupational health needs. Method: A cross-sectional survey, was undertaken over a 5 month period commencing in October 2003. A validated Chinese version of the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Measure was administered to a convenience sample of 89 female street sex workers. A focus group interview was later conducted to gain contextual information. Results: The predominantly mainland Chinese FSWs had a mean age of 36.1 years. These women tended to be less educated and older than the general population of FSWs. They worked long hours with most of their income sent back home to China. Many lived in sub-optimal conditions and risked being abused while at work. The women scored significantly lower in the environmental domains when compared to the general female population. Conclusion: Highlighted is the critical importance of developing a new role, both international and within the Asian region, for community nurses working in an outreach capacity. This role should be visible, affordable and accessible, for at risk populations such as FSWs. The primary focus of the new role would be to establish a close working relationship between sex workers, sex industry owner/operators, health agencies and local authorities. Risk awareness programs developed and conducted by community nurses should embrace the complexity of occupational health issues. Such programs would also have the benefit of affirming the health rights of sex workers and public health. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary data source is a qualitative survey involving interviews with 47 elderly Hong Kong Chinese men and women to ascertain their health-seeking beliefs and behaviors. The author analyzes how public policy and Confucian rhetoric constitute social guidelines, which are perceived in light of an individual's resources, gender and generational experiences and are manifest in health-seeking behaviors: seeking religious solace, preparing special food, visiting formal and informal healers, and shifting expectations of what constitutes family support. The article highlights the interface between public interpretations of old age, morality, religion, filial support, and personalized meaning as manifest in health behaviors. © 2002 Sage Publications.","","Aged; Female; Health Services for the Aged; Health Services Needs and Demand; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Religious Philosophies; Social Change; Social Support; aged; article; elderly care; ethnology; female; health service; Hong Kong; human; male; patient attitude; philosophy; social change; social support; utilization review","","","","","","","Arber N., Gilbert G.N., Transitions in caring: Gender, life course and the care of the elderly, In B.

Phase V, Hong Kong","This paper, based on a study carried out in Hong Kong, outlines the caregiving obligations of Hong Kong Chinese daughters towards their frail elderly parents. A cultural model approach drawn from cognitive anthropology is taken to focus on how Chinese caregiving daughters develop a sense of what is right and emotionally fulfilling and acquire the motivation to care for their parents. An ethnographic approach was used in the study and techniques included guided and open-ended interviews and non-participatory observations. A total of 20 co-residential caregiving daughters were interviewed in their homes on average twice over the course of one year. All interviews were conducted in Cantonese. Although the sample was small, daughters' accounts are structured by reference to cultural models and this structure provides the common basis for generalisability of results. Concepts of Confucian antecedents, reciprocity and personhood and other modern ideas of filial duty are explored. Conclusions are drawn about the shifting rights and obligations of Chinese caregiving daughters within the contemporary urban realities of Hong Kong. The findings of this study have relevance for the development of welfare policy for older Chinese persons and the chronically ill, and to all services involving women. The findings will also serve to inform family caregiver education programs. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Seven multiparous women were interviewed and asked to reflect on their self-care practices within the family home during the month after the birth of their first child. Content analysis was applied to the interviews and major categories identified: good food and bad blood, poisonous sex, dirt and prohibitions, rest and appeasing the placenta god, and competing loyalties. The indication is that these Chinese mothers had attempted to follow their personally constructed interpretations of traditional customary practices, being influenced by close family members, neighbors, and historical precedent. These women further outlined a number of personal variations to traditional practices in the face of increasingly Western influences. We provide insights into the complexity of issues modern Hong Kong Chinese women face in the first postpartum month and on a more global level highlight the importance of culturally sensitive and congruent nursing practice. © 1997 Taylor & Francis.","","Adult; China; Cultural Characteristics; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Medicine, Oriental Traditional; Mothers; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Self Care; Transcultural Nursing; adult; article; China; cultural factor; ethnology; female; Hong Kong; human; mother; oriental medicine; pregnancy; psychological aspect; puerperium; questionnaire; self care; transcultural care","","","","","","","Bruni N., A critical analysis of transcultural theory, The Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing, 5, 3, pp. 26-31, (1988); Cheung S.Y.L., Sze S.M.H., The Hong Kong Report, (1995); Cheung S.Y.L., Mother-in-law tensions mount, The South China Morning Post, (1996); Chiu W.C., The Taboo and Etiquette of Chinese and Outlanders, (1990); Choi E.C., Unique aspects of Chinese-American mothers.

The four top ranking symptoms of mental distress reported included waking in the early hours, loneliness, worry and taking a long time to get to sleep. In general, the level of health related behaviors was high, with a satisfactory diet and low rates of alcohol, nicotine and coffee consumption. However, few women surveyed had previously had a Pap smear. There were also low scores for other preventive health practices. Reinforcement for health behaviors was seen as either a matter of chance or being influenced by powerful others for two thirds of the women. The conclusion highlights the intersection between gender, immigration and social class by drawing attention to issues of acceptance and accessibility of healthcare services for immigrant within host countries. In addition, cultural directions for immigrant health education are outlined. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.","Filipino; Health related behaviors; Hong Kong; Immigration; Locus of control; Social support","Adolescent; Adult; Attitude to Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Health Behavior; Hong Kong; Housekeeping; Humans; Internal-External Control; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Philippines; Questionnaires; Social Support; Women's Health; Women, Working; alcohol; nicotine; adult; alcohol consumption; article; coffee; controlled study; cultural factor; dietary intake; female; gender; health behavior; health care access; health education; health service; Hong Kong; household; human; immigration; loneliness; major clinical study; mental disease; mental health; mental stress; Papanicolaou test; preventive medicine; scoring system; sleep time; social class; social support; symptomatology; wakefulness; worker; adolescent; attitude to health; control; cross-sectional study; ethnology; female; health behavior; Hong Kong; hospital service; manpower; mental health; middle aged; migration; occupational health; Philippines; psychological aspect; questionnaire; statistics; women's health","","","","","","","Aroian K.J., A model of psychological adaptation to migration and resettlement, Nursing Research, 39, 1, pp. 5-10, (1990); Bagley C., Madrid S., Bolitho F., Stress factors and mental health adjustment of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong, International Social Work, 40, pp. 373-382, (1997); Berkman L.F., Syme S.L., Social networks, host resistance and mortality: A 9 year follow up of Alameda country residents, American Journal of Epidemiology, 109, pp. 186-204, (1979); Bernal P., Meleis A.I., Self care actions of Colombian Por Dia domestic workers: On prevention and care, Women and Health, 22, pp. 77-95, (1995); Bond M., Handbook of Chinese Psychology, (1995); Bowling A., Measuring Health, (1991); Brown G.W., Andrews B., Bifulco A., Adler R.Z., Bridges L., Social Support, self esteem and depression, Psychological Medicine, 16, pp. 813-831, (1986); Callaghan P., Hong Kong nurses' health-related behaviors, Journal of Clinical Nursing, 5, pp. 269-270, (1996); Constable N., Maid to Order in Hong Kong: Stories of Filipino Workers New York, (1997); Donald C.A., Ware J.E., The measurement of social support, Research in Community and Mental Health, 4, pp. 325-370, (1982); Donovan J., D'Espaignet E., Merton C., Van Ommeren M., Immigrants in Australia: A health profile, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Ethnic, pp. 122-191, (1992); Feldman P.H., Sapienze A.M., Kane N.M., On the home front: The job of the home aide, Generations, 18, pp. 16-19, (1999); Flaskerud J.H., A proposed protocol for culturally relevant psychotherapy, Clinical Nurse Specialist, 1, 40, pp. 150-157, (1987); French C., Filipino Domestic Workers in Hong Kong: A Preliminary Survey, (1986); Hall J.M., Stevens P.E., Meleis A.I., Marginalization: A Guiding Concept for Valuing Diversity in Nursing Knowledge Development, Advanced Nursing Sciences, 16, pp. 23-41, (1994); Hattar-Pollara M., Meleis A.I., The stress of immigration and the daily lived experiences of Jordanian immigrant women in the United States, Western Journal of Nursing Research, 17, pp. 521-539, (1995); Helman C.G., Culture, Health and Illness, (1994); Hong Kong General Household Survey Social analysis and research section census and statistics department, (1996); House J.S., Laudis K.R., Umberson D., Social relationships and health, Science, 241, pp. 540-549, (1988); Kleinman A., Patients and Healers in the Context of Their Culture, (1980); Lin N., Simeone R.S., Ensel W.M., Kuo W., Social support, stressful life events, and illness: A model and an empirical test, Journal of Health and Social Behaviour, 20, 2, pp. 108-118, (1979); Lipson J.G., Meleis A.I., Methodological issues in research with immigrants, Medical Anthropology, 12, 1, pp. 103-115, (1989); McKenzie J.L., Chrisman N.J., Healing herbs, gods and magic, Nursing Outlook, 255, pp. 326-329, (1977); Masi R., Mensah L., McLeod K., Health and Culture: Exploring the Relationships, (1993); Meleis A.I., Between two cultures: Identity, roles, and health, Healthcare for women International, 12, pp. 365-377, (1990); Meleis A.I., Immigrant women in borderless societies: Marginalized and empowered.
