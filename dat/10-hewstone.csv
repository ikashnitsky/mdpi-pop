Few studies, however, have tested whether contact-based interventions can be scaled up to improve intergroup relations at a large scale. The present research evaluated whether and when the National Citizen Service, a large-scale contact-based intervention reaching one in six 15- to 17-year-olds in England and Northern Ireland, builds social cohesion among adolescents from different ethnic backgrounds. In a diverse sample of adolescents (N = 2099; Mage = 16.37, age range: 15–17 years; 58% female), this study used a pretest–posttest design with a double pretest to assess the intervention’s effectiveness. Controlling for test–retest effects, this study found evidence that the intervention decreased intergroup anxiety and increased outgroup perspective-taking—but not that it affected intergroup attitudes, intergroup trust, or perceptions of relative (dis-)advantage. These (small) effects were greater for adolescents who had experienced less positive contact before participating and who talked more about group differences while participating. These findings suggest that the intervention might not immediately improve intergroup relations—but that it has the potential to prepare adolescents, especially those with less positive contact experiences before the intervention, for more positive intergroup interactions in the future. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adolescents; Intergroup contact; Intergroup relations; Interventions; Youth engagement programs","Adolescent; Attitude; Cooperative Behavior; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Northern Ireland; Prejudice; adolescent; anxiety; article; attitude; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; England; female; human; juvenile; major clinical study; male; Northern Ireland; perception; pretest posttest design; trust; cooperation; human relation; prejudice","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","This research was supported by an Economic and Social Research Council, Advanced Quantitative Methods studentship to the first author.

In the present study, 12,376 students (14.42 years; 50% girls; 38% immigrant students) from 591 classes across three countries (Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden) provided information on social network data, academic achievement, socioeconomic status (SES), and cognitive ability. Social network analysis determined the intergroup network connectedness of students. As expected, country-specific multilevel models reveal a positive linear relationship between outgroup contact and academic achievement for immigrant students in all models, and a negative curvilinear (i.e., concave) relationship between outgroup contact and academic achievement for nonimmigrant students in 2 out of 3 models, while controlling for SES, cognitive abilities, and total network integration. These findings suggest the academic value of outgroup contact for immigrant students and signal its potential for nonimmigrant students. © The Author(s) 2018.","academic achievement; intergroup contact;

We conducted analyzes based on 6,157 notes about 106 wines posted by wine drinkers at a wine social networking site. Our findings suggest that social influence on private wine eval uations occurred by communicating a descriptive norm via written information. We provide empirical evidence that there is social influence on private wine eval uations that is greater than the effect of experts' ratings and prices combined. This influence comes mainly from the first few group members, and increases as a function of source uniformity. Together with a lack of evidence that more credible or expert members have more influence, these findings suggest that influence in this setting is normative rather than informational.

Participants were majority (Italian) and minority (immigrant) high-school students, who were tested at four waves from the beginning of their first year in high-school to the end of the third school year. Results revealed, first, a longitudinal association of quantity (but not quality) of contact with lower intergroup anxiety and more positive explicit attitudes, as well as bidirectional effects over time between explicit attitudes and intergroup anxiety, on the one hand, and quantity and quality of contact, on the other. Second, reduced intergroup anxiety mediated the association between quantity of contact and improved explicit attitudes over time. Third, the product of quantity and quality of contact longitudinally predicted more positive implicit outgroup attitudes over school years. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of findings. © 2022 The Authors.

Here, we acknowledge the central role of mass media use in the acculturation process. We investigate whether immigrants who infrequently use ethnic and host country media, a possible indicator or driver of marginalisation, report higher sympathy with terrorism than frequent media users. We further examine if those who prefer ethnic over host country media, which might reflect or facilitate disengagement from the host society, support terrorism more strongly. To address these research questions, we conducted secondary analyses of a public opinion poll of Muslim immigrants resident in the United Kingdom (N = 880). Focusing on immigrants’ use of ethnic and host country television channels, latent class analysis identified four groups: Frequent and Infrequent Media Users as well as Ethnic and Host Country Media Users. Overall sympathy with terrorism was low. Contesting our hypothesis, Frequent Media Users supported terrorist action more than Infrequent Media Users. Ethnic Media Users also expressed higher sympathy with terrorism than Host Country Media Users. Findings emphasise the dynamic interplay between media use and acculturation challenges; they further suggest strategies to reduce immigrants’ support for terrorism. © 2020 Society for Terrorism Research.","acculturation; Ethnic media; immigrants; support for terrorism; television use","","","","","","Office for Naval Research; U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DHS; National Institute of Justice, NIJ; Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl; European Association of Social Psychology, EASP; Public Safety Canada; European Commission, EC; Minerva Foundation; Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS, FNRS; Fondation Philippe Wiener - Maurice Anspach; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST","Funding text 1: Sandy Schumann is a Lecturer at the Department of Security and Crime Science at University College London. Sandy’s research examines radicalisation and extreme political attitudes in increasingly diverse and digital societies.

In Experiment 1, following a central coloured cue, football fans were instructed to look at the target on pro-saccade trials or its mirrored position on anti-saccade trials. The targets were badges of participants’ favourite football team (in-group), its closest rival, or a non-local neutral team. Our results revealed no significant differences on pro-saccade trials for in- versus out-groups. However, on anti-saccade trials participants made more directional errors for the in-group badge compared to the badges of the neutral and rival teams. Moreover, the percentage of directional errors to in-group stimuli on anti-saccade trials was positively correlated with satisfaction toward the participant’s own team. Experiment 2, with separate blocks of pro- and anti-saccade and simple stimuli replicated the results of Experiment 1. Experiment 3, was conducted to test the effects of familiarity on the performance in pro- and anti-saccade tasks using items with no group relevance. Our results revealed that familiarity of the items with no group relevance did not modulate inhibitory control in anti-saccade trials. Further, Experiment 4 showed that for participants who did not have any interest in football the performance in anti-saccades did not differ for different football teams. Overall, our findings suggest that under conditions of real-world intergroup rivalry in-group relevance modulates inhibitory control over anti-saccades. Future studies should seek to unravel the mechanisms contributing to the effects of group relevance on inhibitory control. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anti-saccade; directional error; in-group; Pro-saccade; rival","adult; analytical error; Article; association; behavior control; female; football; human; human experiment; inhibition (psychology); latent period; male; normal human; priority journal; saccadic eye movement; satisfaction; task performance","","","","","Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council, ERC, (323833)","This work was supported by grants from the Leverhulme Trust to the third and sixth authors, and by ERC Advanced Investigator award 323833 (PePe) to the fourth author.

We examined the mediating role of both intergroup emotions and trust in predicting both positive and negative behavioral tendencies toward the outgroup. In a study of intergroup contact between Catholics and Protestant students in Northern Ireland, outgroup contact (measured by the product of quality and quantity of contact) was directly associated with outgroup trust, outgroup emotions (increases in positive emotion and decreases in negative emotions), and outgroup behavioral tendencies (increases in positive behavioral tendencies and decreases in negative behavioral tendencies). Additionally, the relationship between contact and outgroup behavioral tendencies was mediated by general outgroup trust as well as by positive and negative outgroup emotions. © 2018 Cises.","Intergroup contact; Intergroup emotions; Northern Ireland; Prejudice; Trust","","","","","","Russell Sage Foundation; Russell Sage Foundation, RSF","We gratefully acknowledge the Russell Sage Foundation for their grant support for this study.","Abrams D., Van De Vyver J., Houston D.M., Vasiljevic M., Does terror defeat contact?

Extending earlier research on collective action, integrated threat theory, and intergroup contact theory, we tested whether realistic and symbolic threats would predict collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes; and mediate the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes among the advantaged, Turks, and the disadvantaged, Kurds. Findings from both studies (Study 1, N = 289 Turks; Study 2, N = 209 Kurds) supported the predictive and mediating role of threats on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes. Overall findings suggest that advantaged and disadvantaged groups might not always have disparate psychologies regarding collective action and incorporating perceived threats as antecedents of collective action can help to explain collective action tendencies among both groups especially in conflictual contexts. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","collective action;

These processes are, however, incompatible with a socially diverse world, raising wide academic and political concern about the future of modern societies. With data comprising 22 y of religious diversity worldwide, we show across multiple surveys that humans are inclined to react negatively to threats to homogeneity (i.e., changes in diversity are associated with lower self-reported quality of life, explained by a decrease in trust in others) in the short term. However, these negative outcomes are compensated in the long term by the beneficial influence of intergroup contact, which alleviates initial negative influences.

We examine these propositions through a social network perspective, focusing on friendship networks and educational expectations in adolescence, during which peer socialization is crucial. Longitudinal data from 1,992 adolescents in 91 classrooms allow us to investigate co- and interethnic social selection and social influence processes as well as their aggregated outcomes. In terms of friendship selection, we find that Turkish-origin minority adolescents in Germany have distinct preferences for friends with high educational expectations, among both co- and interethnic peers. In contrast, social influence on Turkish-minority adolescents’ educational expectations is not uniform: only majority-group friends exert a significant (positive) influence. Our results emphasize that bridging social capital gained from social ties with majority-group members enhances ethnic minority adolescents’ educational integration. © 2021.

We address previous inconsistencies by suggesting a time-focused perspective on intergroup relations. We disentangle short-term from longer term immigration trends and argue that a recent increase in immigration should predict PRRP support. With time, however, citizens will adapt to these demographic changes and voting for PRRPs could decline. We drew on official immigration records and representative data from the European Social Survey, capturing the voting behavior of 75,874 individuals from 15 European countries between 2002 and 2014. We found that a recent increase in immigration predicted more PRRP voting, and this relationship was strengthened under conditions of higher economic strain and inequality. In contrast, sustained immigration in the longer term was not related with PRRP votes. © The Author(s) 2021.","country wealth; immigration; populist radical right parties; social inequalities; voting behavior","","","","","","Nuffield Foundation, (WEL/43108)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a Nuffield Foundation Grant WEL/43108 awarded to Miguel R.

However, it is unclear how attending to group relevant information changes the functional connectivity across these networks. We investigated this issue combining resting states and task-based fMRI experiment. The task involved football fans learning associations between arbitrary geometric shapes and the badges of in-group, the rival and the neutral football teams. Upon learning, participants viewed different badge/shape pairs and their task was to judge whether the viewed pair was a match or a mismatch. For whole brain analyses increased activity was found in the IFG, DLPFC, AI, fusiform gyrus, precuneus and pSTS (all in the left hemisphere) for the rival over the in-group mismatch. Further, the ROI analyses revealed larger beta-values for the rival badge in the left pSTS, left AI and the left IFG. However, larger beta-values were found in the left pSTS and the left IFG (but not AI) for the in-group shape. The intrinsic functional connectivity analyses revealed that compare to the pre-task, post task functional connectivity was decreased between the left DLPFC and the left AI. In contrast, it was increased between the left IFG and the left AI and this was correlated with the difference in RT for the rival vs. in-group team. Our findings suggest that attending to group relevant information differentially affects the strength of functional coupling in attention networks and this can be explained by the saliency of the group relevant information. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anterior insula; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; In-group; Inferior frontal gyrus; Intrinsic functional connectivity","Adult; Association Learning; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Judgment; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Rest; Social Perception; Sports; Visual Perception; Young Adult; adult; Article; association; attention; brain electrophysiology; brain function; controlled study; decision making; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; experimental study; female; football; functional anatomy; functional magnetic resonance imaging; fusiform gyrus; human; human experiment; inferior frontal gyrus; learning; left hemisphere; male; mental task; normal human; priority journal; resting state network; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; group process; middle aged; nerve tract; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; perception; physiology; reaction time; recognition; rest; sport; state dependent learning; vision; young adult","","","","","Wellcome Trust, WT; Leverhulme Trust; Royal Society, (101253/Z/13/Z); Royal Society","This work was supported by grants from the Leverhulme Trust to the fourth and fifth authors, a Wellcome Trust senior award to the fifth author, and the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society (n. 101253/Z/13/Z) to the second author.

In this study, we examined cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of discrimination by members of the police and security personnel over and above other types of discrimination and ethnic victimization on the health of immigrant minority students from three different European countries (N = 4,334 immigrant students from 580 ethnically mixed school classes in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden). Results indicate that perceptions of ethnic victimization in the school (measured via social network data) as well as three types of discrimination outside school (discrimination in clubs, public transportation as well as by the police and private security) are associated with current and future negative health outcomes (i.e., psychosomatic problems) in immigrant minority students. Among the different types of discrimination, discrimination by the police and private security personnel was most common and had the most negative effect on immigrant minority students’ health. Practical and political implications of our findings as well as differences in discrimination and violence by the police between the United States and Europe are discussed. © 2017 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues","","Germany; Netherlands; Sweden; United States; adolescence; ethnic minority; immigrant; perception; police force","","","","","","","Adam E.K., Heissel J.A., Zeiders K.H., Richeson J.A., Ross E.C., Ehrlich K.B., Peck S.C., Developmental histories of perceived racial discrimination and diurnal cortisol profiles in adulthood: A 20-year prospective stud, Psychoneuroendocrinology, 62, pp. 279-291, (2015); Racial/Ethnic Profiling: Amnesty international’s Position on Degrading Identity Check, (2014); Deadly Force: Police Use of Lethal Force in the United States, (2015); Barreto M., Ellemers N., Detecting and experiencing prejudice: New answers to old question, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 52, pp. 139-219, (2015); Benner A.D., Kim S.Y., Experiences of discrimination among Chinese American adolescents and the consequences for socioemotional and academic developmen, Developmental Psychology, 45, 6, pp. 1682-1694, (2009); Bennett G.G., Wolin K.Y., Robinson E.L., Fowler S., Edwards C.L., Racial/ethnic harassment and tobacco use among African American young adult, American Journal of Public Health, 95, 2, pp. 238-240, (2005); Berg A.O., Melle I., Rossberg J.I., Romm K.L., Larsson S., Lagerberg T.V., Hauff E., Perceived discrimination is associated with severity of positive and depression/anxiety symptoms in immigrants with psychosis: A cross-sectional stud, BMC Psychiatry, 11, (2011); Bergman L.R., Magnusson D., A person-oriented approach in research on developmental psycho-patholog, Development and Psychopathology, 9, 2, pp. 291-319, (1997); Bonino S., Visible Muslimness in Scotland: Between discrimination and integratio, Patterns of Prejudice, 49, 4, pp. 367-391, (2015); Borders A., Liang C.T.H., Rumination partially mediates the associations between perceived ethnic discrimination, emotional distress, and aggressio, Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 17, 2, pp. 125-133, (2011); Brody G.H., Chen Y.F., Murry V.M., Ge X., Simons R.L., Gibbons F.X., Cutrona C.E., Perceived discrimination and the adjustment of African American youths: A five-year longitudinal analysis with contextual moderation effect, Child Development, 77, 5, pp. 1170-1189, (2006); Brondolo E., Libby D.J., Denton E., Thompson S., Beatty D.L., Schwartz J., Gerin W., Racism and ambulatory blood pressure in a community sampl, Psychosomatic Medicine, 70, 1, pp. 49-56, (2008); Bundespolizeigesetz [German Police Law], (1994); Bryant-Davis T., Adams T., Alejandre A., Gray A.A., The trauma lens of police violence against racial and ethnic minoritie, Journal of Social Issues, 73, 4, pp. 852-871, (2017); Cairns R.B., Cairns B.D., Neckerman H.J., Early school dropout: Configurations and determinant, Child Development, 60, 6, pp. 1437-1452, (1989); Carter R.T., Racism and psychological and emotional injury: Recognizing and assessing race-based traumatic stres, The Counseling Psychiatrist, 35, 1, pp. 13-105, (2007); Charbonneau A., Spencer K., Glaser J., Understanding racial disparities in police use of lethal force: Lessons from fatal police-on-police shooting, Journal of Social Issues, 73, 4, pp. 744-767, (2017); Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries, (2014); Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries, (2014); Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries, (2015); Correll J., Park B., Judd C.M., Wittenbrink B., The police officer’s dilemma: Using ethnicity to disambiguate potentially threatening individual, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, 6, pp. 1314-1329, (2002); Coker T.R., Elliott M.N., Kanouse D.E., Grunbaum J.A., Schwebel D.C., Gilliland M.J., Schuster M.A., Perceived racial/ethnic discrimination among fifth-grade students and its association with mental healt, American Journal of Public Health, 99, 5, pp. 878-884, (2009); Conklin H.D., Perceived Racism and Mental Health: A Meta-Analytic Review.

Academic work suggests that increasing immigration reduces social cohesion and subjective well-being, but these studies mainly focused on white majority populations. Using the 2002 to 2014 European Social Survey, we analyze data from 5,149 ethnic minority respondents living in twenty-four European countries. We examine the association between immigration and respondents’ well-being, mediated by two critical cognitive mechanisms: perceived discrimination and generalized trust. We find that in the short term, immigration is associated with greater perceived discrimination, which in turn is associated with lower trust and well-being. Over the longer term, though, immigration is associated with lower perceived discrimination from ethnic minorities, yielding greater generalized trust and perceived well-being. © 2021 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.","contact; discrimination; ethnic diversity; ethnic minority; immigration; trust; well-being","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/R008507/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Nuffield Foundation, (WEL/43108); Nuffield Foundation","This research was supported by grants from the Nuffield Foundation (WEL/43108 - M.R.R., M.R.B., D.S.M., and M.H.) and Economic and Social Research Council (ES/R008507/1 – M.R.B., D.L., M.H.).

We conducted analyzes based on 6,157 notes about 106 wines posted by wine drinkers at a wine social networking site. Our findings suggest that social influence on private wine evaluations occurred by communicating a descriptive norm via written information. We provide empirical evidence that there is social influence on private wine evaluations that is greater than the effect of experts’ ratings and prices combined. This influence comes mainly from the first few group members, and increases as a function of source uniformity. Together with a lack of evidence that more credible or expert members have more influence, these findings suggest that influence in this setting is normative rather than informational.

Additional aims were to investigate when and why the effects of extended contact occur. In particular, intergroup empathy was tested as a mediator and direct contact (i.e. cross-group friendship) as a moderator of extended contact. Participants were Italian and immigrant elementary school children. Results showed that extended contact was associated with improved intergroup empathy, which, in turn, was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes, stereotypes and behavioural intentions. These effects were significant only among participants with a low or moderate level of direct contact. The theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

In three studies, we apply social network analyses to generate alternative contact parameters. Studies 1 and 2 examine self-reported and network-based parameters of positive and negative contact using cross-sectional datasets (N = 291, N = 258), indicating that both methods help explain intergroup relations. Study 3 examines positive and negative direct and extended contact using the previously validated network-based contact parameters in a large-scale, international, and longitudinal dataset (N = 12,988), demonstrating that positive and negative direct and extended contact all uniquely predict intergroup relations (i.e., intergroup attitudes and future outgroup contact).

A cross-sectional comparison of segregated schools and a mixed elementary school at time 1 revealed that both Asian and White British in the mixed school reported more positive intergroup relations. A longitudinal analysis found that the transition from segregated elementary to mixed secondary schools was associated with Asian British developing more positive intergroup relations.

Both experimental studies were conducted with Italian undergraduate participants. Experiment 1 (N = 186) tested whether Roma are generalized onto (i.e., perceived as prototypical of) Romanians to a higher extent under intergroup realistic and symbolic threat than under no-threat. It also explored the direction of the phenomenon and its underlying mechanism. Experiment 2 (N = 90) provided additional evidence on the effect of threat on such generalization phenomenon considering a different pair of groups (Islamic terrorists, Arabs) and employing a less blatant measure of generalization. Overall, these studies provided consistent evidence of outgroup-to-outgroup generalization, clarifying the conditions of its occurrence. These results contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon of outgroup-to-outgroup generalization and of its impact on outgroup perception and prejudice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Intergroup threat; Negative minority outgroups; Outgroup projection; Outgroup-to-outgroup generalization","adult; Arab; article; experimental study; female; human; major clinical study; male; perception; prejudice; Romanian (citizen); terrorism","","","","","Department of Psychology University of Bologna","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research reported in this article was supported by funds (Reg. 14 Prot. 139) from the Department of Psychology University of Bologna to the first author.","Albarello F., Rubini M., Relazioni intergruppi e fenomeni di deumanizzazione [Intergroup relations and dehumanization phenomena], Psicologia Sociale, 3, pp. 67-94, (2008); Albarello F., Rubini M., Se sei una persona umana allora mi piaci di più.

Due to social and attitudinal barriers, we argue that disabled people comprise one of the groups most affected by discrimination. Using data from the European Social Survey, including representative samples from 32 countries surveyed in seven waves (2002–2014), we compared the effects of ableism on HWB with discrimination targeting other groups (e.g., sexism and ageism). We tested these effects between individuals (i.e., comparing the effects of individuals belonging to different disadvantaged groups) and within individuals (i.e., examining the case of individuals belonging to multiple disadvantaged categories). Results indicated that facing ableism is associated with lower HWB, and that this effect has a greater magnitude when compared to the effect of being discriminated because of other disadvantaged group memberships. Our findings highlight the significance of addressing ableism in research and social policy. © 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues","","Europe; policy approach; social development;

The problem generally arises when either a highly relevant theory is ignored or when missing key variables distort the results. Examples of this fallacy are drawn from the expanding research literature on intergroup contact, where we discuss the implications of missing critical variables from the analysis (including segregation, effects of negative as well as positive contact, extended contact, and contact when the outgroup is in the majority). The policy issues involved include racially desegregated schools, minority protest, the impact of neighborhood diversity, and anti-immigration voting. Three suggestions for avoiding the fallacy are emphasized—the use of mediation–moderation analysis, longitudinal research, and multilevel analysis. We end by outlining five simple principles, based on our own experience in the United States and the United Kingdom, that may increase the impact of social scientists’ research on public policy. © 2017 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues","","","","","","","","","Aberson C.L., Gaffney A.M., An integrated threat model of explicit and implicit attitudes, European Journal of Social Psychology, 39, pp. 808-830, (2009); Abascal M., Baldassarri D., Love thy neighbor?

To date, little is known about what factors may differentially influence these effects. We propose that differentiating not only between positive and negative contact (i.e., its valence), but also considering the intensity (i.e., low or high positivity/negativity) of contact valence is critical to understanding contact effects. We predicted that intensifying positivity in the realm of positive contact would have a stronger effect on outgroup attitudes than intensifying negativity. We report evidence supporting this hypothesis from three experiments which manipulated the quality of feedback given during a cooperation task by a confederate who acted as a member of a student outgroup (two online: N = 87, N = 169; one in person: N = 78), summarized in an internal meta-analysis and a large survey of White British majority and Asian British minority members (N = 2,994). Our results suggest that intensity of valenced intergroup contact may be a key factor for resolving inconsistencies in the current literature on valenced intergroup contact. © The Author(s) 2024.","contact intensity; contact valence; intergroup contact; positive–negative asymmetry; prejudice","","","","","","Miles Hewstone; Eva Jaspers; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (278649612); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/N018893/1); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (464-15-265, 016-125-141)","Funding text 1: The authors thank Kathrin Wolff, Franziska Spannbauer, Linda and Juliane Debertsh\u00E4user, Anne van der Put, and Jaap van Slageren for their help with data collection.

However, prior research has rarely considered this in tandem with the bias-reducing effects of intergroup contact or tested whether outgroup proportions have similar effects for oppressed minority-group members. In two preregistered studies, we tested whether contact moderates the association between outgroup proportions and ingroup bias among White and Black Americans (total N > 75,000). As hypothesized, more Black residents in an area predicted greater explicit (but not implicit) ingroup bias among White respondents who reported low (but not high) contact with Black people. By contrast, more White residents in an area predicted lower explicit (but not implicit) ingroup bias among Black respondents regardless of intergroup contact with White people. We qualify previous findings by demonstrating that the association between outgroup proportions and ingroup bias depends on one’s group membership and level of intergroup contact. © The Author(s) 2021.","conflict theory; Implicit Association Test; implicit bias; intergroup contact; intergroup relations","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Axt J.R., The best way to measure explicit racial attitudes is to ask about them, Social Psychological and Personality Science, 9, pp. 896-906, (2018); Bar-Anan Y., Nosek B.A., A comparative investigation of seven indirect attitude measures, Behavior Research Methods, 46, pp. 668-688, (2014); Barlow F.K., Hornsey M.J., Thai M., Sengupta N.K., Sibley C.G., The wallpaper effect: The contact hypothesis fails for minority group members who live in areas with a high proportion of majority group members, PLoS ONE, 8, (2013); Bates D., Maechler M., Bolker B., Walker S., Lme4: Linear mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4, (2015); Bauer D.J., Curran P.J., Probing interactions in fixed and multilevel regression: Inferential and graphical techniques, Multivariate Behavioral Research, 40, pp. 373-400, (2005); Binder J., Zagefka H., Brown R., Funke F., Kessler T., Mummendey A., Maquil A., Demoulin S., Leyens J.-P., Does contact reduce prejudice or does prejudice reduce contact?

Drawing on the threat and contact hypotheses, this study develops and tests a framework examining the role of segregation in the out-group size/prejudice relationship. We suggest that whether increasing minority share in a community generates processes of contact and/or perceived threat will depend on how segregated groups are from one another. This, in turn, will determine when high minority share communities have positive, negative, or null effects on inter-group attitudes. Using data from white British individuals in England, we observe that community segregation moderates the effect of community percent non-white British on prejudice, as well as mechanisms of positive inter-group contact and perceived threat. Residents of more homogeneous communities report relatively warm inter-group attitudes, regardless of how segregated they are. Residents living among high proportions of out-group where the groups are integrated report an improvement in out-group attitudes. It is only residents living among large out-group populations where groups are more segregated from one another - at the nexus of high minority share and high segregation - who report colder out-group attitudes. This higher prejudice is driven by both lower positive contact and higher perceived threat in these communities. Using two waves of cohort panel data, longitudinal analysis provides more robust evidence in support of the diversity-segregation nexus framework: communities becoming more ethnically mixed and segregated see prejudice increase, while those becoming more mixed and integrated see stable, or somewhat improving, relations. Collectively, this paper shows that mechanisms of positive contact and threat appear conditional on both the size of out-groups in an area and how segregated groups are from one another, generating key differences in when and how increasing ethnic out-group size affects inter-group relations. © 2018 The Author(s).

Beyond Tajfel’s and Turner’s seminal writings, they focus on more recent efforts to define social identification, and discuss how multiple categorization offers insights into the dynamics underlying intergroup relations. The author defines self-categorization as social categorization applied to oneself and introduces self-categorization theory as a detailed account of when, how, and why they describe themselves in terms of social categories. They introduce self-categorization theory as a perspective on how, when, and why individuals categorize themselves into certain social groups. Social identification varies from individual to individual, and from situation to situation, reflecting the extent to which a group membership is incorporated into an individual’s self-concept. Social identification changes the nature of social categorization. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","group status; self-categorization theory; social identification; social identity theory; social psychological theories","","","","","","","","Aberson C.L., Healy M., Romero V., Ingroup bias and self-esteem: A meta-analysis, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 4, 2, pp. 157-173, (2000);

Recent studies suggest there is little evidence perceived ethnic threat plays a role in this relationship. This paper re-examines the roles of ethnic threat and prejudice in the diversity/cohesion relationship. First, we test threat/prejudice as conceptualised in the literature: as mediators of diversity’s effect. Second, we test a reformulation of the roles of threat/prejudice: as moderators of diversity’s effect. Applying multi-level models to cross-sectional and longitudinal data of White British individuals across England and Oldham (a unique English town case-study) we find neighbour-trust lower in diverse communities. However, perceived-threat/prejudice does not mediate this relationship. Instead, we find perceived-threat/prejudice moderate diversity’s impact on neighbour-trust. The result is diversity only reduces neighbour-trust among individuals who already viewed out-groups as threatening. Longitudinal analysis confirms the importance of out-group attitudes in the diversity/neighbour-trust relationship. In diverse communities, residents whose out-group attitudes improve, or worsen, become more, or less, trusting of their neighbours. However, in homogeneous communities, changes in out-group attitudes are not linked to changes in neighbour-trust. We therefore argue and demonstrate that perceived-threat emerges from other societal processes (such as socio-economic precariousness) and it is when individuals who already view out-groups as threatening experience diverse neighbourhoods that local cohesion declines. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Based on the social-psychological literature, we hypothesize that indirect contact predicts future direct contact by reducing intergroup anxiety. Across five longitudinal studies (Study 1: German adults, N = 560; Study 2: German, Dutch, and Swedish school students, N = 6,600; Study 3: Northern Irish children, N = 1,593; Study 4: Northern Irish adults, N = 404; Study 5: German adults, N = 735), we systematically examined this effect, and further tested the mediating role of intergroup anxiety in Studies 3 to 5. Cross-lagged models provided consistent evidence for the positive effect of indirect contact on future direct contact, whereas a reduction in intergroup anxiety mediates this effect in most models. Results highlight the importance of indirect contact, which has the potential to increase direct contact, and thus promote social cohesion in diverse contexts, over time. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Electronic contact; Extended contact; Intergroup anxiety; Intergroup contact","Adolescent; Anxiety; Child; Emigrants and Immigrants; Ethnic Groups; Female; Germany; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Ireland; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Religion; Social Behavior; Sweden; adult; anxiety; article; child; controlled study; female; German (citizen); human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; Northern Irish; student; adolescent; anxiety; ethnic group; Germany; human relation; Ireland; middle aged; migrant; Netherlands; psychology; religion; social behavior; Sweden","","","","","Freudenberg Stiftung; Max-Planck Institute; Oliver Christ; Volkswagen Stiftung; Atlantic Philanthropies; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (CH 743)","Data collection for this project was supported by the Volkswagen Stiftung and the Freudenberg Stiftung (for Study 1), the Atlantic Philanthropies (for Study 2), the NORFACE ERA NET Plus Migration in Europe-programme (for Study 3), the Community Relations Unit (for Study 4), and the Max-Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity, Germany (for Study 5).

This meta-analysis covers the 20 years of research that currently exists on the extended contact hypothesis, and consists of 248 effect sizes from 115 studies. The aggregate relationship between extended contact and intergroup attitudes was r =.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [.22,.27], which reduced to r =.17, 95% CI = [.14,.19] after removing direct friendship’s contribution; these results suggest that extended contact’s hypothesized relationship to intergroup attitudes is small-to-medium and exists independently of direct friendship. This relationship was larger when extended contact was perceived versus actual, highlighting the importance of perception in extended contact. Current results on extended contact mostly resembled their direct friendship counterparts, suggesting similarity between these contact types. These unique insights about extended contact and its relationship with direct friendship should enrich and spur growth within this literature. © 2018 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","contact hypothesis; cross-group friendship; extended contact; indirect contact; intergroup contact; vicarious contact","Attitude; Friends; Group Processes; Humans; Social Distance; Social Identification; attitude; friend; group process; human; meta analysis; social behavior; social distance","","","","","Joseph-Armand Bombardier Canada Graduate Scholarship; Canadian Geriatrics Society, CGS; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Shelly Zhou holds a Joseph-Armand Bombardier Canada Graduate Scholarship (CGS) Doctoral Scholarship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.

However, long-term effects of intergroup contact that consider social network dynamics have rarely been studied at a young age. Study 1 validated an optimized social network approach to investigate intergroup contact (N = 6,457; Mage  = 14.91 years). Study 2 explored the developmental trajectories of intergroup contact by applying this validated network approach in a cross-sequential design (four-cohort-four-wave; N = 3,815; 13-26 years). Accelerated growth curve models showed that contact predicts the development of attitudes in adolescence, whereas acquired attitudes buffer against decreasing contact in adulthood. Findings highlight the potential of social network analysis and the developmental importance of early intergroup contact experiences.  © 2016 The Authors.

However, the extent to which this so-called in-group favoritism is driven by relevance is not clear. Here, we investigated this issue in a group of university rowers using a novel perceptual matching task based on the team label–color associations. Across three experiments, participants showed enhanced performance for the in-group stimulus regardless of its familiarity level. These findings confirmed the role of relevance in in-group favoritism. In a further control study, the advantage for certain stimuli was not found in an independent sample of participants who were not identified with the teams but were familiar with the label–color associations, indicating that in-group relevance was necessary for the in-group favoritism. Together, these findings suggest that in-group relevance facilitates learning across existing and new associations. The consequences of these findings for understanding in-group effects on perceptual processing are discussed.

Structural equation models with latent variables showed that postwar contact had beneficial effects, being positively related to outgroup trust and intergroup forgiveness, and negatively associated with social distance. Moreover, postwar contact had indirect effects on reduced morbidity and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms via increased intergroup forgiveness and reduced social distance. We also analyzed the role of potential inhibitors and facilitators of the beneficial effects of postwar contact, and found that experience of violence played a detrimental role, while prewar contact was related to positive outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed the interactive effects of prewar and postwar contact, as positive effects of present-day contact on intergroup relations (promoting trust and reducing social distance) were strongest when prewar contact was high. Conversely, postwar contact was positively associated with outgroup trust only for respondents with low levels of experience of violence. Findings underline the value of promoting intergroup contact in postconflict settings. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Conflict-related trauma; Forgiveness; Prewar and postwar contact; Trust","Bosnia and Herzegovina; mental health; morbidity; numerical model; social conflict; social impact; violence; war","","","","","","","Bar-Tal D., Cehajic S., From collective victimhood to social reconciliation: Outlining a conceptual framework, War and Community: Collective experiences in the former Yugoslavia, pp. 125-136, (2013); Biro M., Ajdukovic D., Corkalo D., Djipa D., Milin P., Weinstein H.M., Attitudes toward justice and social reconstruction in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, My neighbour, my enemy, pp. 183-205, (2004); Bogardus E.S., Measuring social distances, Journal of Applied Sociology, 9, pp. 299-308, (1925); Brown R., Hewstone M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in experimental social psychology, pp. 255-343, (2005); Browne K., Snowball sampling: Using social networks to research non-heterosexual women, International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8, pp. 47-60, (2005); Cakal H., Prejudice and interethnic contact in a Cypriot village (Unpublished master thesis), (2007); Carballo M., Report of an evaluation of a Harvard Trauma Program project funded by the World Bank Conflict Unit in the Canton of Travnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Geneva, Switzerland: International Centre for Migration and Health., (2003); Carballo M., Smajkic A., Zeric D., Dzidowska M., Gebre-Medhin J., Van Halem J., Mental health and coping in a war situation: The case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Journal of Biosocial Science, 36, pp. 463-477, (2004); Carmichael C., Ethnic cleansing in the Balkans: Nationalism and the destruction of tradition, (2002); Cehajic S., Brown R., Silencing the past: Effects of intergroup contact on acknowledgment of in-group responsibility, Social Psychological and Personality Science, 1, pp. 190-196, (2010); Cehajic S., Brown R., Castano E., Forgive and forget?

Members of minority, majority, and equal-size groups freely described outcome allocations made by either ingroup or outgroup members. The abstraction and valence of the terms used were analyzed. Majority members expressed ingroup favoritism by describing the majority ingroup with positive terms at a higher level of abstraction than negative terms. They also provided more favorable descriptions of ingroup members than minority members did. Minority members expressed ingroup favoritism, but also outgroup derogation, by referring to the majority outgroup with negative terms at a higher level of abstraction than positive terms. These findings highlight the distinct consequences of minority and majority memberships on these two facets of intergroup discrimination. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","ingroup favoritism; linguistic abstraction; majority group size; minority group size; outgroup derogation","","","","","","Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna; Italian Ministry of University and Research, (RBFR128CR6_004)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research reported in this article was supported by a grant from the Italian Ministry of University and Research FIRB 2012 (Protocollo RBFR128CR6_004) to Silvia Moscatelli and by RFO 2012 funds from Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna to Monica Rubini.","Albarello F., Rubini M., The role of reduced humanity in producing linguistic discrimination, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 41, pp. 224-236, (2015); Bettencourt B.A., Miller N., Hume D.L., Effects of numerical representation withincooperative settings: Examining the role of salience in in-group favouritism, British Journal of Social Psychology, 38, pp. 265-287, (1999); Blanz M., Mummendey A., Otten S., Normative evaluations and frequency expectations regarding positive versus negative outcome allocations between groups, European Journal of Social Psychology, 27, pp. 165-176, (1997); Bourhis R.Y., Sachdev I., Gagnon A., Intergroup research with the Tajfel matrices: Methodological notes, The psychology of prejudice: The Ontario Symposium, 7, pp. 209-232, (1994); Brewer M.B., The psychology of prejudice: Ingroup love or outgroup hate?, Journal of Social Issues, 55, pp. 429-444, (1999); De Dreu C.K.W., Social value orientation moderates ingroup love but not outgroup hate in competitive intergroup conflict, Group Processes Intergroup Relations, 13, pp. 701-713, (2010); Douglas K.M., Sutton R.M., Wilkin K., Could you mind your language?

A multilevel perspective, however, requires appropriate statistical models. Conventional multilevel regression models suffer from a number of limitations. Among these are the restriction to include only manifest variables and only one Level 1 outcome variable. Moreover, it is not possible to test complex models (i.e., with multiple mediators and outcomes in a single step). In this paper, we introduce multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) as a new and promising development within psychological methods that helps overcome the limitations inherent in conventional MLM. MSEM combines SEM with MLM and offers the best of both worlds. Because MSEM allows using latent instead of manifest variables, measurement error can be taken into account. Moreover, the measurement model can be tested on both the within and between-levels of analysis.MSEMenables researchers to specify Level 2 outcome variables and allows the researcher to test complex multilevel models (i.e., simultaneous tests of multiple direct and indirect effects). We illustrate the potential of MSEM using three examples from our own research, provide the corresponding software code as online supplementary material, and discuss important practical issues. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Intergroup contact; Levels of analysis; Multilevel analysis; Multilevel structural equation modeling; Psychology of groups","human; human experiment; measurement error; mediator; multilevel analysis; outcome variable; psychology; PsycINFO; scientist; software; statistical model; structural equation modeling","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/N018893/1)","","Allen M.S., Jones M.C., Sheffield D., Attribution, emotion, and collective efficacy in sports teams, Group Dynamics, 13, pp. 205-217, (2009); Asparouhov T., Muthen B.O., Computationally efficient estimation of multilevel high-dimensional latent variable models, Paper presented at the 2007.

Experiment 1 compared balanced similarity with conditions inducing only differences or only similarities. “Balanced similarity” led to more positive outgroup attitudes; its differences with the “high similarity” condition were mediated by reduced distinctiveness threat, whereas its differences with the “low” similarity condition were mediated by higher perceived intergroup similarity. Experiment 2 compared the “balanced similarity” imagined contact scenario with the “standard” (positive) imagined contact scenario (Crisp, Stathi, Turner, & Husnu, 2008), and found that both conditions promoted equally favourable attitudes that were significantly more positive than in the control condition. However, only the “balanced similarity” imagined contact condition differed from the control condition on intergroup anxiety and contact self-efficacy. The “balanced similarity” condition also had an indirect effect (via self-efficacy) on positive action tendencies towards the outgroup. We discuss the utility of “balanced similarity” imagined contact, especially where contact is limited and conflict is present. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","contact self-efficacy; distinctiveness threat; imagined contact; intergroup similarities; mutual intergroup differentiation","","","","","","","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behaviour, Organizational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Asbrock F., Gutenbrunner L., Wagner U., Unwilling, but not unaffected – Imagined contact effects for authoritarians and social dominators, European Journal of Social Psychology, 43, pp. 404-412, (2013); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioural change, Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215, (1977); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Brewer M.B., In-group bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive-motivational analysis, Psychological Bulletin, 86, pp. 307-324, (1979); Brewer M.B., The social self: On being same and different at the same time, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 17, pp. 475-482, (1991); Brewer M.B., Campbell D.T., Ethnocentrism and intergroup attitudes: East African evidence, (1976); Brown R.J., The role of similarity in intergroup relations, The social dimension: European developments in social psychology, pp. 603-623, (1984); Brown R.J., The effects of intergroup similarity and cooperative vs. competitive orientation on intergroup discrimination, British Journal of Social Psychology, 23, pp. 21-33, (1984); Brown R., Abrams D., The effects of intergroup similarity and goal interdependence on intergroup attitudes and task performance, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 22, pp. 78-92, (1986); Brown R., Hewstone M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in experimental social psychology, 37, pp. 255-343, (2005); Converse J.M., Presser S., Survey questions: Handcrafting the standardized questionnaire, (1986); Crisp R.J., Husnu S., Meleady R., Stathi S., Turner R.N., From imagery to intention: A dual-route model of imagined contact effects, European review of social psychology, 21, pp. 188-236, (2010); Crisp R.J., Stathi S., Turner R.N., Husnu S., Imagined intergroup contact: Theory, paradigm, and practice, Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2, pp. 1-18, (2008); Crisp R.J., Turner R.N., Can imagined interactions produce positive perceptions?

Using a three-wave longitudinal dataset (N = 565), this research aimed to (a) test the within-person simultaneous associations between positive and negative contacts and several intergroup outcomes (i.e. attitudes, prejudice, perceived variability, anxiety, empathy and deprovincialization), while controlling for between-person associations; (b) understand whether and how within-person simultaneous associations are mediated by empathy, anxiety and deprovincialization, and moderated by between-person contact and social dominance orientation (SDO). We found that within- and between-person variations in positive and negative contacts were associated with all intergroup outcomes, except intergroup anxiety for within-person contact. These associations were mainly mediated by the same processes (i.e., empathy and deprovincialization); the associations of within-person variations in contact with intergroup outcomes were largely independent of between-person contact and SDO. Intra-individual contact fluctuations matter for simultaneous prejudice reduction, suggesting the importance of frequent positive contact. © 2023 The Authors.

Previous studies have shown a neural own-race effect with greater BOLD response to own race compared to other race faces. In our study, white participants completed a social-categorization task and an individuation task while viewing the faces of both black and white strangers after having answered questions about their previous experiences with black people. We found that positive contact modulated BOLD activity in the right fusiform gyrus (rFG) and left inferior occipital gyrus (lIOC), regions associated with face processing. Within these regions, higher positive contact was associated with higher activity when processing black, compared to white faces during the social categorisation task. We also found that in both regions a greater amount of individuating experience with black people was associated with greater activation for black vs. white faces in the individuation task. Quantity of contact, implicit racial bias and negatively valenced contact showed no effects. Our findings suggest that positive contact and individuating experience directly modulate processing of out-group faces in the visual cortex, and illustrate that contact quality rather than mere familiarity is an important factor in reducing the own race face effect. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Adult; African Americans; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neurosciences; Occipital Lobe; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Racism; Recognition, Psychology; Temporal Lobe; adult; African American; Caucasian; diagnostic imaging; female; human; male; neuroscience; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; pattern recognition; photostimulation; physiology; psychology; racism; temporal lobe","","","","","Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, SBE, (0339122); Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, SBE; British Academy","This research was supported by a grant from the British Academy to S.

We propose that the positive effect of extended contact can occur even when the ingroup members having outgroup friends are unknown to the individual who becomes aware of such contact – depersonalized extended contact. However, to be effective depersonalized extended contact requires ingroup normative support. We tested this prediction by providing participants with information about the number of ingroup members (Spaniards) who have outgroup (immigrants) friends -descriptive norms - and the normative support for cross-group friendship -injunctive norms. Three experiments tested how different levels of depersonalized extended contact (none vs. low vs. high), consensus regarding norms about cross-group friendship (low vs. high), and the source of such norms (ingroup vs. outgroup) impact intergroup orientations. Even low levels of depersonalized extended contact had positive effects on intergroup orientations, when there was normative support for cross-group friendship from the ingroup, but not from the outgroup. Two additional experiments extended these effects to a behavioral outcome, and showed that the positive effect of ingroup injunctive norms was mediated by the enhanced belief that outgroup members had a genuine interest in intergroup contact (integrative motives). However, the lack of effect of outgroup injunctive norms was mediated by the suspicion that outgroup members held utilitarian motives for contact. Implications of these findings for improving intergroup relations through depersonalized extended contact and injunctive normative influence are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","","adult; article; consensus; friend; friendship; human; immigrant; prediction; Spaniard","","","","","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness to Angel Gómez; Leverhulme Trust; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (PSI2015-67754-P)","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was supported by funds from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness to Angel Gómez (PSI2015-67754-P, 2015), and the Leverhulme Trust to Miles Hewstone.; Funding text 2: Funding: This research was supported by funds from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness to Angel Gómez ( PSI2015-67754-P , 2015), and the Leverhulme Trust to Miles Hewstone.

Often the way social cohesion is assessed, though, varies across studies and only some aspects of the construct are included (e.g., trust). The current research explores the relationship between diversity and social cohesion across a number of indicators of social cohesion including neighbourhood social capital, safety, belonging, generalized trust, and volunteering. Furthermore, social psychological theories concerning the role of positive contact and its impact on feelings of threat are investigated. Using a sample of 1070 third generation ‘majority’ Australians and structural equation modelling (SEM), findings suggest ethnic diversity is related to positive intergroup contact, and that contact showed beneficial impacts for some indicators of social cohesion both directly and indirectly through reducing perceived threat. When interethnic contact and perceived threat are included in the model there is no direct negative effect between diversity and social cohesion.

How young adults manage their relationships with their wider network of friends and family during such transitions is, however, not well understood. Using a prospective longitudinal design, we investigate changes in the size and composition of complete egocentric networks of two cohorts of young adults moving away from home to college. We show that, although networks grow rapidly due to an influx of new friends made at college, the social overload that would result is partially mitigated through the progressive loss of pre-transition friendships (but not family relationships). In addition, most of the new relationships are placed in the outermost, emotionally less close network layers that are less costly to maintain. In contrast, the more intimate inner layers of the network remain stable in size, with efforts being made to conserve these relationships. The overriding importance of face-to-face interaction in creating and maintaining ties (compared to digital media) results in the emotional quality of a tie being traded off against the constraints imposed by physical distance. The most reliable predictor of the proportion of original members with whom relationships were maintained post-transition was pre-transition network size, with weaker effects due to geographical proximity and personal popularity in the new social context. These findings have implications for managing transitions to a new environment at any life stage. © 2024 The Authors","Family; Friendships; Modes of interaction; Relationship decay; Social convoy theory; Socioemotional selectivity theory","Adolescent; Adult; Female; Friends; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Prospective Studies; Social Networking; Social Support; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; female; friend; human; human relation; longitudinal study; male; prospective study; psychology; social network; social support; young adult","","","","","Medical Research Council, MRC; European Research Council, ERC, (295663); European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020, (662725); Horizon 2020","The study was funded by a Medical Research Council graduate studentship to MK and a European Research Council Advanced grant (RELNET; grant 295663 ) and an EU Horizon 2020 research grant (IBSEN; grant 662725 ) to RD.

We propose that the closeness of the relationships respondents have with contact partners can explain inconsistencies in previous findings. In three studies (total N = 953), we tested the associations between positive intimate, negative intimate, positive superficial, and negative superficial contact and attitudes toward different outgroups (immigrants and gay people). We hypothesized that: (H1) the effect of positive contact would be maximized in intimate interactions; (H2) the effect of negative contact would be maximized in superficial interactions; (H3) positive intimate and negative superficial contact would have similar power in predicting attitudes. Results always supported H1, and supported H2 and H3 only with immigrants. Findings held also when controlling for category salience and agreeableness, but not for social dominance orientation, which instead strengthened the effect of negative superficial contact. Overall, findings clarify the positive–negative contact asymmetry. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","contact asymmetry; intergroup contact; negative contact; outgroup attitudes; positive contact; subtle prejudice","article;

We analysed affective generalization using multilevel models, with items of each affective variable nested within the individual, to avoid aggregation bias due to averaging across items, hence false positives. As hypothesized, we found strong associations, but not perfect correspondence, between contact-related and outgroup-related affective variables. Moreover, we found that category salience facilitated the affective generalization of affective empathy and trust, whereas the quantity of intimate contact facilitated the generalization of anxiety. These findings suggest that affective intergroup climate hinges upon specific contact interactions, and that it is vital to promote positive affective reactions during contact and the formation of more intimate relationships with outgroup members. © The Author(s) 2020.","category salience; intergroup anxiety; intergroup contact; intergroup empathy; intergroup trust","","","","","","","","Arnadottir K., Lolliot S., Brown R., Hewstone M., Positive and negative intergroup contact: Interaction not asymmetry, European Journal of Social Psychology, 48, pp. 784-800, (2018); Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, Journal of Memory and Language, 59, pp. 390-412, (2008); Bates D., Maechler M., Bolker B., Walker S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, Journal of Statistical Software, 67, pp. 1-48, (2015); Batson C.D., The altruism question: Toward a social-psychological answer, (1991); Batson C.D., Ahmad N.Y., Using empathy to improve intergroup attitudes and relations, Social Issues and Policy Review, 3, pp. 141-177, (2009); Batson C.D., Polycarpou M.P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Mitchener E.C., Bednar L.L., Highberger L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings towards the group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 105-118, (1997); Blascovich J., Mendes W.B., Hunter S.B., Lickel B., Kowai-Bell N., Perceiver threat in social interactions with stigmatized others, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80, pp. 253-267, (2001); Brauer M., Curtin J.J., Linear mixed-effects models and the analysis of nonindependent data: A unified framework to analyze categorical and continuous independent variables that vary within-subjects and/or within-items, Psychological Methods, 23, pp. 389-411, (2018); Brewer M.B., Miller N., Beyond the contact hypothesis: Theoretical perspectives on desegregation, Groups in contact: The psychology of desegregation, pp. 281-302, (1984); Brown R., Hewstone M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 37, pp. 255-343, (2005); Capozza D., Vezzali L., Trifiletti E., Falvo R., Favara I., Improving intergroup relationships within and outside the contact situation: The role of common ingroup identity and emotions of empathy and anxiety, TPM: Testing, Psychometrics, Methodology in Applied Psychology, 17, pp. 17-36, (2010); Dhont K., van Hiel A., De Bolle M., Roets A., Longitudinal intergroup contact effects on prejudice using self- and observer-reports, British Journal of Social Psychology, 51, pp. 221-238, (2012); Eisinga R., Grotenhuis M., Pelzer B., The reliability of a two-item scale: Pearson, Cronbach, or Spearman–Brown?, International Journal of Public Health, 58, pp. 637-642, (2013); Esses V.M., Dovidio J.F., The role of emotions in determining willingness to engage in intergroup contact, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, pp. 1202-1214, (2002); Fox J., Effect displays in R for generalised linear models, Journal of Statistical Software, 8, pp. 1-27, (2003); Fuochi G., Voci A., Veneziani C.A., Boin J., Fell B., Hewstone M., Is negative mass media news always associated with outgroup prejudice?

It tested the generality of the positive–negative asymmetry effect among majority (N = 357) and minority (N = 101) group members in Iceland. Little evidence of asymmetry was observed: the beneficial effects of positive contact were mostly as strong as the detrimental effects of negative contact, for both direct and extended contact. However, evidence was found for alternative interaction models in which positive contact buffers the negative effects of negative contact, and negative contact enhances the benefits of positive contact. These interaction effects were found only for direct contact and principally in the majority group, but were also found for the minority group, though more weakly. No interaction was observed for extended contact.

Homophily reinforces homogeneous social networks, and heterophily creates new experiences and collaborations. However, at the extremes, high levels of homophily can cultivate prejudice toward out-groups, whereas high levels of heterophily can weaken in-group support. Using data from 24,726 adults (M = 46 years; selected from 10,398 English neighborhoods) and the composition of their social networks based on age, ethnicity, income, and education, we tested the hypothesis that a middle ground between homophily and heterophily could be the most beneficial for individuals. We found that network homophily, mediated by perceived social cohesion, is associated with higher levels of subjective well-being but that there are diminishing returns, because at a certain point increasing network homophily is associated with lower social cohesion and, in turn, lower subjective well-being. Our results suggest that building diverse social networks provides benefits that cannot be attained by homogeneous networks. © The Author(s) 2024.","network homophily; social cohesion; trust; well-being","Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Social Networking; Social Support; Young Adult; adult; aged; female; human; human relation; male; middle aged; satisfaction; social network; social support; young adult","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI","The authors would like to thank Paul Norman and his NewETHPOP project colleagues for providing invaluable data on projecting ethnic populations in England between 2001 and 2011.

Recently, Moradi, Sui, Hewstone, and Humphreys (2015) found a novel effect of in-group bias on a simple perceptual matching task in which football fans responded more efficiently to stimuli newly associated with their own football team than stimuli associated with rival or neutral teams. This result is consistent with a robust self-bias effect in which individuals show a large performance advantage in responding to stimuli associated with the self over stimuli associated with a close friend or a stranger (Sui, He, & Humphreys, 2012). The present research utilised a perceptual matching paradigm to investigate the relations between self and in-group prioritisation amongst a sample of college rowers. Across two experiments, we demonstrated a reliable performance advantage for self and team stimuli. We also found a relationship between the self and team advantage in RT, and demonstrated an overlap in the perception of self- and team-associated shapes that was stronger in participants who reported a greater sense of group identity with their team. Further, we found no relation between the team bias and positive valence implicitly associated with the team, showing that the team bias effects are unlikely to be driven by emotional significance. The results are consistent with an overlap between self and in-group representation, which may provide evidence for a common process driving both self and in-group perceptual advantage effects. © 2017 The Authors","In-group prioritisation; Self representation; Self-bias; Social attention; Social identity","Adult; Association Learning; Attention; Bias; Emotions; Female; Form Perception; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Reward; Social Identification; Young Adult; adult; associative learning; attention; emotion; female; human; human relation; male; pattern recognition; physiology; psychomotor performance; reward; social behavior; statistical bias; young adult","","","","","Wellcome Trust, WT, (106164/Z/14/Z); Wellcome Trust, WT; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/K013424/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Leverhulme Trust, (RPG-2012-6); Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council, ERC","This work was supported by grants from the ERC (Advanced Investigator), Wellcome Trust ( 106164/Z/14/Z ) (Senior Investigator) and ESRC to the last author and from the Leverhulme Trust ( RPG-2012-6 ) (Group Modulation of Perception) to the third author.

In this vein, using daily diary data, we examined the relation between the number of daily positive and negative interactions of White British majority (N = 744) and Asian British minority people (N = 582) with members of the respective outgroup, with RWA, SDO, perceived ingroup norms, neighbourhood diversity and contextual deprivation. Results showed that for the majority group, ingroup norms in favour of intergroup contact were positively associated with positive intergroup encounters, whereas Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) was positively associated with negative intergroup contact. Neighbourhood diversity was positively associated with positive and negative intergroup encounters. Moreover, RWA moderated the relationship between neighbourhood diversity and both positive and negative contact of White British people. For the minority group, ingroup norms were positively associated with positive intergroup contact, and the relationship between ingroup norms and negative contact was moderated by SDO. Overall, different factors affect positive and negative intergroup contact of majority and minority groups. We discuss the implications of the findings for future research and interventions. © 2022 The Authors.

Using person-oriented approaches, we identified four groups of adolescents. The two largest groups in both national contexts were “religiously-oriented strong dual identifiers” and “equally-strong dual identifiers”. The latter experienced less BII distance and more BII conflict, and perceived their identities as more similar and overlapping. These findings highlight that nuanced differences in strong dual identity patterns and trajectories have implications for how strong dual identities are experienced and perceived. © 2021 The Author(s).

Society however does not yet enjoy the full prejudice-reducing benefits of intergroup contact because opportunities for contact are often not taken up, and segregation persists in the face of diversity. In this article, we review recent investigations on the social psychology of individuals' seeking and avoiding intergroup contact and set the stage for new research in this area. We call for a new generation of research on intergroup contact that addresses a novel and critical research question: What personal, situational, and wider social factors move individuals towards or away from engaging in intergroup contact? This research can help us design intervention strategies to ensure that opportunities for, and benefits of, intergroup contact are fully enjoyed by individuals and groups in increasingly diverse societies. © 2018 The Authors Social and Personality Psychology Compass Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; integration; male; organization; social aspect","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (10.50313, DP150102210)","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Numbers: Discovery Project DP150102210 and support of Professor Daphne Keats Philanthropic Gift (10.50313)","Aboud F.E., The development of prejudice in childhood and adolescence, On the nature of prejudice: Fifty years after Allport, pp. 310-326, (2005); Abrams J., Giles H., Hispanic television activity: Is it related to vitality perceptions, Communication Research Reports, 26, pp. 247-252, (2009); Al Ramiah A.A., Schmid K., Hewstone M., Floe C., Why are all the White (Asian) kids sitting together in the cafeteria?

Research on intergroup contact has shown that the numbers of outgroup and ingroup friends we have influence our outgroup attitudes, whereas research on socialization has shown that the attitudes held by our friends influence our outgroup attitudes. Past research, however, examined these processes in isolation, which precludes discerning whether having friends, or the attitudes held by our friends, are both important in shaping our outgroup attitudes, and, if so, which is more important. To disentangle these effects, we conducted a 5-wave social network study in 2 ethnically diverse schools (N = 1,170 students). By applying a novel longitudinal coevolution model, we were able to separate the effects of having ingroup and outgroup friends (contact effects), and the effects of those friends’ attitudes (socialization effects), on individuals’ outgroup attitudes, while controlling for friendship selection processes. In so doing, we found that it is principally the attitudes of ingroup friends—not outgroup friends’ attitudes or having ingroup and outgroup friends alone—that predict individuals’ outgroup attitudes. Our findings have important theoretical implications, as we demonstrate that combining the divergent approaches of intergroup contact and socialization enables us to better understand outgroup attitude development. Our findings also have practical implications, as we show that, even in diverse environments, individuals rely primarily on friends from their own group to inform their attitudes toward other groups. © 2021 American Psychological Association","Friendship; Intergroup contact; Outgroup attitudes; Social network analysis; Socialization","Attitude; Friends; Group Processes; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Social Identification; Socialization; adult; article; coevolution; female; friend; friendship; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; social network analysis; socialization; theoretical study; attitude; friend; group process; human relation; social behavior","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/N018893/1)","This research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Open Research Area (ORA) Research grant “Positive and Negative Asymmetry of Intergroup Contact: A Dynamic Approach” (ES/N018893/1).","Aboud F.

This study sought to explore the longer-term effects of participating in an intergroup contact intervention on attitudes of Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs regarding relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Following the contact encounter, compared to a control condition, participants’ perceptions of intergroup threat, outgroup trust, willingness to forgive the outgroup, and involvement in competitive victimhood were assessed. Results indicated the generally positive role that the contact intervention had on Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs participants. However, the effects among Israeli Arabs, compared to Israeli Jews, were significantly weaker, pointing to the potential effect of power asymmetry on the outcomes of intergroup contact. Potential explanations, as well as theoretical and practical implications of the findings, are discussed. © 2021 American Psychological Association","Arab–jewish conflict; Intergroup contact; Power asymmetry; Reconciliation; Trust","Israel; asymmetry; ethnic group; participatory approach; peace process; perception; political conflict; power relations","","","","","","","Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Intergroup contact as a tool for reducing, resolving, and preventing intergroup conflict: Evidence, limitations, and potential, American Psychologist, 68, 7, pp. 527-542, (2013); Allport G., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Alon I., Bar-Tal D., The role oftrust in conflict resolution: The Israeli-Palestinian case and beyond, (2016); Amir Y., Contact hypothesis in ethnic relations, Psychological Bulletin, 71, 5, pp. 319-342, (1969); Andrighetto L., Halabi S., Nadler A., Fostering trust and forgiveness through the acknowledgment of others, past victimization, Journal ofSocial and Political Psychology, 5, 2, pp. 651-664, (2017); Andrighetto L., Mari S., Volpato C., Behluli B., Reducing competitive victimhood in Kosovo: The role of extended contact and common ingroup identity, Political Psychology, 33, 4, pp. 513-529, (2012); Aronson E., Patnoe S., The jigsaw classroom: Building cooperation in the classroom, (1997); Baker P.

Specifically, we assessed the role of different forms of intergroup contact (i.e., cross-group friendship, positive and negative, and direct and extended contact) on the abstraction of negative terms used by White British people, as a linguistic measure of outgroup derogation. As expected, the frequency of direct negative intergroup contact was associated with higher negative language abstraction in depicting Asian British people. However, this association was weaker for White British people with higher levels of positive direct and extended intergroup contacts compared to those with lower levels of positive direct and extended contact. Overall, results emphasize the importance of independently analyzing the impact of positive and negative intergroup contact experiences, as well as understanding how they interact with each other in the communication of intergroup discrimination. © The Author(s) 2024.","diary study; immigration; intergroup contact; language abstraction; prejudice","adult; aged; article; British Asian; Caucasian; controlled study; female; friendship; human; immigration; interpersonal communication; major clinical study; male; middle aged; migrant; prejudice","","","","","Università di Bologna, UNIBO","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by Alma Idea 2022 award to the first author from the University of Bologna.

In this 3-wave longitudinal study, a person-oriented approach was used to examine dual identity development in a sample of 2145 Muslim adolescents (MT1 = 15 years, 51% female) in four Western European countries. The results of a growth-mixture model pointed toward four distinct developmental Classes: (1) “Dual identity”, (2) “Separation to dual identity”, (3) “Assimilation to dual identity”, and (4) “Separation”. Multiple group comparisons further showed that adolescents in Class 1 were well adjusted, but well-being (e.g., internalizing problems, life satisfaction) and health were even higher among adolescents in Class 2. Adolescents in Class 3 had consistently lower levels of well-being, and adolescents in Class 4 had lower levels of socio-cultural adjustment (e.g., problem behaviour at school, delinquent behaviour, and lack of intergroup contact). The findings underscore that most Muslim minority adolescents in Western Europe develop a dual identity, and that the developmental process, not simply the outcome, matters for adjustment. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adjustment; Dual identity; Ethnic minority adolescents; Growth mixture models; Identity acculturation; Muslim immigrants","Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Ethnic Groups; Europe; Female; Humans; Islam; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Minority Groups; Problem Behavior; Social Identification; adolescent; adolescent behavior; ethnic group; Europe; female; human; Islam; longitudinal study; male; minority group; problem behavior; psychology; social behavior","","","","","NORFACE; O.S.; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, (https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?no=5353&db=e&doi=10.4232/cils4eu.5353.3.3.0)","Funding text 1: The CILS4EU research project was funded by the NORFACE ERA NET Plus Migration in Europe-program (2009–2013).

Information related to the self and our social ingroups is prioritised for cognitive processing and can therefore form some of these key biases. However, ingroup biases may be elicited not only for established social groups, but also for minimal groups assigned by novel or random social categorisation. Moreover, whether these ‘ingroup biases’ are related to self-processing is unknown. Across three experiments, we utilised a social associative matching paradigm to examine whether the cognitive mechanisms underpinning the effects of minimal groups overlapped with those that prioritise the self, and whether minimal group allocation causes early processing advantages. We found significant advantages in response time and sensitivity (dprime) for stimuli associated with newly-assigned ingroups. Further, self-biases and ingroup-biases were positively correlated across individuals (Experiments 1 and 3). However, when the task was such that ingroup and self associations competed, only the self-advantage was detected (Experiment 2). These results demonstrate that even random group allocation quickly captures attention and enhances processing. Positive correlations between the self- and ingroup-biases suggest a common cognitive mechanism across individuals. These findings have implications for understanding how social biases filter our perception of the world. © 2020, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Wellcome Trust, WT, (203139/Z/16/Z); Wellcome Trust, WT; Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl; Medical Research Council, MRC, (MR/P014097/1); Medical Research Council, MRC","This work was supported by a Medical Research Council Fellowship (MR/P014097/1), a Christ Church Junior Research Fellowship and a Christ Church Research Centre Grant to P.

One important question is whether the nature of online engagements between groups relates to the nature of encounters between these groups in the real world. We analyzed online conversations that occurred between members of protest groups from opposite sides of the political spectrum, obtained from Facebook event pages used to organize upcoming political protests and rallies in the United States and the United Kingdom and the occurrence of violence during these protests and rallies. Using natural language processing and text analysis, we show that increased engagement between groups online is associated with increased violence when these groups met in the real world. The level of engagement between groups taking place online is substantial, and can be characterized as negative, brief, and low in integrative complexity. These findings suggest that opposing groups may use unstructured online environments to engage with one another in hostile ways. This may reflect a worsening of relationships, in turn explaining the observed increases in physical violence offline. These findings raise questions as to whether unstructured online communication is compatible with positive intergroup contact, and highlights the role that the Internet might play in wider issues of extremism and radicalization. © The Author(s) 2021.","group processes; intergroup contact; political extremism; social media; social networks","","","","","","University College Oxford Radcliffe Scholarship; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (446-16-015); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by grants from EPSRC and the University College Oxford Radcliffe Scholarship.

We also tested whether participants' prior contact with migrants and distance in time of the recalled contact experiences moderated the effect of the recall on linguistic discrimination. Across two experimental studies, evidence consistently showed that participants who recalled first positive and then negative interactions expressed less linguistic discrimination against migrants in the second event recalled, compared to those who recalled two negative interactions. Moreover, participants who reported having fewer positive intergroup experiences expressed less linguistic discrimination against migrants in recalling negative and then positive interactions, compared to recalling two positive interactions. Findings of Study 2 also revealed an effect of the temporal distance of the recalled events, with more beneficial effects of positive-negative sequences of contact when participants retrieved temporally recent compared to distant intergroup encounters. Overall, this research highlights the key role of positive contact in counteracting the effects of negative contact, leading to a reduction in linguistic discrimination. © 2020 The Authors","Intergroup contact; Intergroup relationship; Linguistic discrimination; Migrant people","adult; article; experimental study; human; migrant; recall","","","","","Marie Sklodowska-Curie; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (790318); Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: This work has received funding to the first and second authors from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 790318.; Funding text 2: This work has received funding to the first and second authors from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 790318 .

Drawing on arguments related to intergroup relations and anomie, we expect that contexts characterized by a comparatively high degree of openness mitigate a trust-eroding effect of immigration. In contrast, we expect that contexts of low openness or high conservation may reinforce a trust-eroding effect. We test these propositions using survey data from Europe and the United States merged with regional indicators on immigration and value contexts. The results show that high levels of contextual openness attenuate trust-eroding consequences of immigration growth. With regard to mechanisms, we find that contextual openness moderates how change in immigration relates to generalized forms of trust rather than outgroup trust. This points to an overall anomie-reducing function of openness norms, especially in times of ethnic change. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Ethnic diversity; Immigration; Normative climate; Social trust; Value context","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (GRK 1461/1)","The first author acknowledges a doctoral scholarship ( GRK 1461/1 , funded by the German Research Foundation ) during his initial work on this project.

Yet in real-world settings not only positive, but also negative intergroup contact occurs, which have opposing effects. To date little is known about whether and how an individual’s valenced history of intergroup contact influences contact effects and how this dynamic change happens during specific instances of intergroup contact. A pilot study examined the psychological impact of a novel paradigm to assess intergroup contact using a behavioral game. We then conducted two studies, which allowed us to observe a sequence of up to 23 in and outgroup interactions and their behavioral outcomes in a continuous prisoner’s dilemma behavioral game (N = 116, 2,668 interactions; N = 89, 1,513 interactions). As expected, participants showed a clear ingroup bias in expectations and cooperation. Furthermore, the quality of contact history moderated contact effects. Specifically, intergroup contact following a positive history of intergroup contact had a stronger effect on intergroup expectations than contact following a negative history thereof. Findings are discussed in view of the importance of considering the valenced history of intergroup contact, as well as new research questions on intergroup contact that can be addressed with this novel contact paradigm. © 2021.

Using a longitudinal, large-scale data set including 6,726 majority and minority participants (Mage = 14.98 years at Wave 1; 55% female) from 4 western European countries that were followed in 3 waves over 2 years, we systematically examined the development of outgroup contact during adolescence and tested the role of hypothesized predictors (i.e., intergroup attitudes and social identity) for explaining this development. In the majority, growth curve models revealed consistent patterns of ethnic homophily characterized by a continuous decline of outgroup contact, whereas this negative growth was buffered by a positive change of intergroup attitudes and a negative change of national identity during adolescence. In contrast, in the minority, outgroup contact was characterized by higher mean levels and a nonlinear development (i.e., no systematic decline or increase) of outgroup contact. Findings highlight the developmental importance of adolescence for promoting positive intergroup relations, especially for the majority, and emphasize the usefulness of contact interventions with adolescent students in school. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Ethnic homophily; Intergroup attitudes; Intergroup contact; Social identity","Adolescent; Attitude; Ethnic Groups; Europe; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Minority Groups; Psychology, Adolescent; Social Identification; adolescent; attitude; child psychology; clinical trial; ethnic group; Europe; factor analysis; female; group process; human; human relation; longitudinal study; male; minority group; multicenter study; psychology; social behavior","","","","","Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries","The Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries research project was funded by the NORFACE ERA NET Plus Migration in Europe Programme.

In both experiments, participants read a team problem-solving scenario where a solution was supported by either a numerical majority or minority of the team. In some conditions, the team leader also supported the same solution as the majority or minority in other conditions the leader did not. When the leader was supported by the majority, its solution was rated as more favorable by participants than when supported by either the leader or majority on its own. When the leader was supported by the minority, its solution was rated as either less favorable or equally favorable than when supported by the leader or minority on its own. However, when the leader was supported by the minority participants rated an alternative (better) solution that was not discussed by the leader, as more favorable. These findings indicate that leadership endorsement results in greater compliance to a majority-endorsed position but to more elaboration, and better decision-making, to a minority-endorsed position. The policy implications of this research for the role of leaders in team decision-making are discussed. © 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues","","","","","","","","","Alvaro E.M., Crano W.D., Indirect minority influence: Evidence for leniency in source evaluation and counterargumentation, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 949-964, (1997); Baker S.M., Petty R.E., Majority and minority influence: Source-position imbalance as a determinant of message scrutiny, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, pp. 5-19, (1994); Bechtoldt M.N., De Dreu C.K.W., Choi H.S., Motivated information processing, social tuning, and group creativity, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 99, pp. 622-637, (2010); Bechtoldt M.N., De Dreu C.K., Nijstad B.A., Choi H.S., Motivated information processing, social tuning, and group creativity, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 99, pp. 622-637, (2010); Butera F., Mugny G., Legrenzi P., Perez J.A., Majority and minority influence, task representation and inductive reasoning, British Journal of Social Psychology, 35, pp. 123-136, (1996); Chen S., Chaiken S., The heuristic-systematic model in its broader context, Dual-process theories in social psychology, pp. 73-96, (1999); Crano W.D., Social influence, social identity, and ingroup leniency, Group consensus and innovation, pp. 122-143, (2001); Crano W.D., Chen X., The leniency contract and persistence of majority and minority influence, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, pp. 1437-1450, (1998); De Dreu C.K.W., When too little or too much hurts: Evidence for a curvilinear relationship between task conflict and innovation in teams, Journal of Management, 32, pp. 83-107, (2006); De Dreu C.K.W., Nijstad B.A., van Knippenberg D., Motivated information processing in group judgment and decision making, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 12, pp. 22-49, (2008); De Dreu C.K.W., West M.A., Minority dissent and team innovation: The importance of participation in decision-making, Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, pp. 1191-1201, (2001); French J.R.P., Raven B., The bases of social power, Studies in social power, pp. 150-167, (1959); Galinski A.D., Magee J.C., Inesi M.B., Gruenfeld D.H., Power and perspectives not taken, Psychological Science, 17, pp. 1068-1074, (2006); Gardikiotis A., Martin R., Hewstone M., The representation of majorities and minorities in the British Press: A content analytic approach, European Journal of Social Psychology, 34, pp. 637-646, (2004); Gick M.L., Holyoak K.J., Analogical problem solving, Cognitive Psychology, 12, pp. 306-355, (1980); Gick M.L., Holyoak K.J., Schema induction and analogical transfer, Cognitive Psychology, 15, pp. 1-38, (1983); Gigerenzer G., Gaissmaier W., Heuristic decision making, Annual Review of Psychology, 62, pp. 451-482, (2011); Guinote A., Power and goal pursuit, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 33, pp. 1076-1087, (2007); Higgins M.C., Follow the leader?

Increasing ethnic diversity poses critical new challenges as people interact with new cultures, norms, and values, or avoid such encounters. Heated academic and political debates focus on whether and how changes in ethnic composition affect societies and local communities. Yet, there is insufficient scientific evidence of how living in a more diverse society affects individuals' well-being and health. The aim of this study is to test the extent to which increasing neighbourhood ethnic diversity affects individuals’ subjective health and well-being and objective stress levels as measured by allostatic load. We analyse a large panel data set containing over 47,000 English respondents living in 15,545 neighbourhoods in England from the British Household Panel Survey and the UK Household Longitudinal Study, from 2004 to 2011. We match respondents to neighbourhoods and merge contextual information about levels of neighbourhood ethnic diversity and deprivation from UK Censuses, whilst controlling for background characteristics. We distinguish between short- and long-term effects of ethnic diversity on individual subjective well-being and health as well as allostatic load using a set of multilevel mixed-effects models. We make cautious causal interpretations by estimating fixed-effects models and cross-lagged panel models. We assess the robustness of our findings by replicating our analysis using alternative composite measures of diversity and allostatic load. In the short-term, increasing ethnic diversity of local areas is associated with a dip in subjective well-being, but short-term changes are not prolonged or profound enough to affect chronic stress (allostatic load). The initial negative impact of ethnic diversity on subjective well-being and health dissipates with time. In the long-term, no effects of ethnic diversity on well-being and health or chronic stress (allostatic load) are detected. Understanding the dynamic nature of the effects of ethnic diversity on individuals has critical implications for social and public health policies – issues prominent in, for example, the UK (Brexit) and the US (election of President Donald Trump). Our analysis identifies and enables the promotion of beneficial effects, while targeting the pernicious components to turn diversity into a valuable asset in a globalising world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Allostatic load; Ethnic diversity; Health; Neighbourhood; Well-being","Allostasis; England; European Union; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; United Kingdom; England; United Kingdom; data set; ethnicity; health impact; household survey; neighborhood; panel data; quality of life; adult; article; chronic stress; election; England; female; household; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; population research; public health; wellbeing; allostasis; England; European Union; United Kingdom","","","","","NatCen Social Research and Kantar Public, (ES/R008507/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Nuffield Foundation, (WEL/43108); University of Manchester","Funding text 1: UKHLS is an initiative funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and various Government Departments, with scientific leadership by the Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex, and survey delivery by NatCen Social Research and Kantar Public.

To investigate this question, we applied (random-intercept) cross-lagged panel models in two studies featuring different samples, measurements, and contexts. We found longitudinal contact–attitude associations in cross-lagged panel models, which cannot differentiate within-person and between-person effects. In random-intercept cross-lagged panel models, we identified between-person effects but not within-person effects. These results conflict with the contact hypothesis, which assumes that contact leads to intra-individual attitude change. We further investigated whether between-person effects represent spurious correlations caused by potential confounders (demographic characteristics, personality, and intergroup ideologies), but found that this was not the case. Our findings highlight the need to further investigate within-person effects and potential explanations of between-person differences in contact and attitudes. © The Author(s) 2023.","intergroup contact; outgroup attitudes; random-intercept cross-lagged panel model; within-person effects","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/N018893/1); NordForsk, (95263)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant “Positive and negative asymmetry of intergroup contact: A dynamic approach” (ES/N018893/1) and the NordForsk grant “Structural, cultural and social integration among youth: A multidimensional comparative project” (95263).

In postconflict Northern Ireland, widespread residential segregation and a largely separate school system limit opportunities for intergroup contact between adolescents from the Catholic and Protestant communities. We evaluated whether a large-scale intervention to facilitate intergroup contact between students attending separate schools (the ‘Shared Education’ program) improves a range of outcomes relevant for intergroup relations in Northern Ireland. We conducted a 5-wave longitudinal, quasi-experimental study that followed a large sample of school students (N = 5,159, Mage = 12.4, age range: 10–14 years; 2,988 girls, 2,044 boys) from 56 predominantly Catholic or Protestant schools from sixth to tenth grade. We compared the developmental trajectories of students who, in 9th (14–15 years) and 10th (15–16 years) grade, shared some classes with students from the other community, as part of the program, to students who did not. We found that participating in shared classes had a medium-size, positive effect on the amount of intergroup contact students had outside of class, and small, positive effects on students’ outgroup attitudes, outgroup trust, and intergroup empathy (but not on their intergroup anxiety, future contact intentions, deprovincialization, or multicultural beliefs). Our findings show that a school-based program of shared education can provide a viable and effective intervention to facilitate intergroup contact, improve intergroup relations, and foster social integration among adolescents at a large scale in a postconflict society © 2021 American Psychological Association","Adolescence; Intergroup contact; Intergroup relations; Intervention; Northern ireland","Adolescent; Attitude; Child; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Northern Ireland; Schools; Students; Trust; adolescent; attitude; child; female; human; human relation; male; Northern Ireland; school; student; trust","","","","","","","Aberson C.

Measuring contact variables and attitudes toward immigrants (Study 1, N = 428; Study 2, N = 426) and gay men and women (Study 3, N = 220), we found that intimate and positive direct intergroup contact was associated with more positive attitudes toward outgroup members, whereas exposure to negative news was related to more negative attitudes. Moreover, our results supported the buffering hypothesis, as the negative association between negative news and intergroup attitudes was significantly weaker amongst respondents with higher levels of intimate and positive intergroup contact. © The Author(s) 2019.","buffering role;

Parent training programs are effective preventive interventions, but only reach caregivers who attend them. In this study, programs were implemented alongside a community mobilization process, intended to use caregivers’ social networks to disseminate new parenting skills community wide. We used social network analysis to explore whether this intervention, first, increased positive parenting, second, changed social networks of female caregivers (selection), and, third, influenced parenting behavior via connections (socialization), while controlling for psychiatric morbidity, parenting stress, alcohol misuse, and child’s age. “Colored” Afrikaans-speaking female caregivers (N = 235; mean age 35.92 years) in a rural community in South Africa, with children between 1½ and 18 years old, were included in the study; two waves of data were collected (January–April 2016 and June–October 2017). We detected community-wide increases in positive parenting behavior (involvement, supervision, consistent discipline, and reduced corporal punishment). Attending at least one session of a parenting skills training program (n = 51; 21.7%) significantly predicted increases in network centrality (i.e., outdegree and indegree). Caregivers appeared to use similar parenting behavior to other caregivers they were connected to within the network, especially when those others attended a parenting skills training program. Overall, the results suggest that the information in the intervention was spread throughout the community through social interactions with program attendees and the community mobilization process. The results also illustrate the value of social network analysis for ascertaining the processes by which the intervention achieved its impact. © 2020, The Author(s).","Community mobilization; Intervention; Parenting; Social influence; Social network analysis","Adult; Caregivers; Child; Child Rearing; Female; Humans; Parenting; Rural Population; Social Network Analysis; South Africa; adult; Afrikaans; alcohol abuse; article; caregiver; child; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; parental behavior; parental stress; punishment; rural population; skill; social interaction; social network; socialization; South Africa; speech; training; child parent relation; child rearing","","","","","World Childhood Foundation, (15368, 15589, 15747)","The project was funded by the World Childhood Foundation (grants numbers 15368, and 15589, 15747).

Furthermore, Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-Volpe, and Ropp (1997) postulated, but did not test, that the usefulness of extended (or vicarious) over direct contact lies in these forms of indirect contact being likely to elicit less anxiety and more group salience at the time of the interaction, both of which are beneficial for contact. The present paper reports two experiments comparing the effects of direct and vicarious contact on: (i) outgroup attitudes and anxiety for future contact both immediately after contact (posttest) as well as a week later (delayed posttest), and (ii) their elicited interaction-induced anxiety and group salience. Both studies were conducted in Cyprus, with Greek Cypriot participants and the Turkish Cypriot community as the outgroup. Results did not support Wright et al.’s postulations. They furthermore showed that direct contact had a relative advantage over vicarious contact in leading to more positive outgroup attitudes at posttest, but that attitudes reverted to pretest levels for both conditions at delayed posttest. Vicarious, unlike direct, contact, did, however, lead to a persistent reduction of anxiety for future contact, thus suggesting that the greatest utility of indirect forms of contact may lie in their emotionally preparing individuals for subsequent face-to-face interactions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety for future contact; Direct contact; Outgroup attitudes; Vicarious contact","adult; anxiety; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; Cyprus; female; human; male; pretest posttest design; thinking","","","","","","","Andrighetto L., Mari S., Volpato C., Behluli B., Reducing competitive victimhood in Kosovo: The role of extended contact and common ingroup identity, Political Psychology, 4, pp. 513-529, (2012); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Aron A., Aron E.N., Smollan D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612, (1992); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215, (1977); Brown R., Hewstone M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 37, pp. 255-343, (2005); Christ O., Hewstone M., Tausch N., Wagner U., Voci A., Hughes J., Cairns E., Direct contact as a moderator of extended contact effects: Cross-sectional and longitudinal impact on outgroup attitudes, behavioral intentions, and attitude certainty, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 36, pp. 1662-1674, (2010); Converse J.M., Presser S., Survey questions: Handcrafting the standardized Questionnaire, (1986); Costa P.T., McCrae R.R., Revised NEO personality inventory (NEO-PIR) and NEO five factor inventory (NEO-FFI) professional manual, (1992); Crisp R.J., Turner R.N., Imagined intergroup contact: Refinements, debates, and clarifications, Advances in intergroup contact, pp. 135-151, (2013); Crisp R.J., Husnu S., Meleady R., Stathi S., Turner R.N., From imagery to intention: A dual-route model of imagined contact effects, European Review of Social Psychology, 21, pp. 188-236, (2010); Dovidio J.F., Eller A., Hewstone M., Improving intergroup relations through direct, extended and other forms of in direct contact, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 14, pp. 147-160, (2011); Eller A., Abrams D., Gomez A., When the direct route is blocked: The extended contact pathway to improving intergroup relations, International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 36, pp. 637-646, (2012); Feddes A.R., Noack P., Rutland A., Direct and extended friendship effects on minority and majority children's interethnic attitudes: A longitudinal study, Child Development, 80, pp. 377-390, (2009); Gomez A., Tropp L.R., Fernandez S., When extended contact opens the door to future contact: Testing the effects of extended contact on attitudes and intergroup expectancies in majority and minority groups, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 14, pp. 161-173, (2011); Harwood J., The contact space: A novel framework for intergroup contact research, Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29, pp. 147-177, (2010); Hewstone M., Swart H., Fifty-odd years of inter-group contact: From hypothesis to integrated theory, British Journal of Social Psychology, 50, pp. 374-386, (2011); Kenny D.A., Kashy D.A., Cook W.L., Dyadic Data Analysis, (2006); Mazziotta A., Mummendey A., Wright S.C., Vicarious intergroup contact effects: Applying social-cognitive theory to intergroup contact research, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 14, pp. 255-274, (2011); Ortiz M., Harwood J., A social cognitive theory approach to the effects of mediated intergroup contact on intergroup attitudes, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 51, pp. 615-631, (2007); Paolini S., Hewstone M., Cairns E., Voci A., Effects of direct and indirect cross-group friendships on judgments of Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland: The mediating role of an anxiety-reduction mechanism, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 30, pp. 770-786, (2004); Pettigrew T.F., Tropp L.R., A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 90, pp. 751-783, (2006); Pettigrew T.F., Tropp L.R., How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice?

Within the social sciences, these changes have been reflected in concerns about the implications of social diversity. Although early research noted that diversity may have negative consequences for societies and individuals, more recent scholarship has indicated that diversity is not always translated into negative outcomes. These inconsistent findings initiated a scholarly debate concerning the impact of many different forms of diversity for a host of social outcomes. It is now clear that the boundary conditions of these effects are yet to be fully understood. This Special Issue offers a collection of research advances identifying mediating and moderating variables addressing when and why diversity impacts intergroup relational outcomes. By focusing on different levels of diversity (i.e., in the society and in groups), this research also sheds light on the effectiveness of ideologies and policies for managing diversity.

Although this policy has been associated with improvements in the quality of life, here we explore how it interacts with the social environment. We examine how the existence of PA legislation influences the effect of social equality on the health and well-being of disabled people. Multilevel analysis was performed using data from the European Social Survey (n = 18,924), including 31 countries and 7 waves of data (2002–2014). Results show that social equality has a positive effect on well-being, but only in countries with PA. The relationship between social equality and well-being, in countries with PA, is explained by increased public participation, satisfaction with the political and economic situation, and a more positive opinion about the health services.

Recently, however, intergroup contact theory has been criticized for neglecting the wider social context as well as for ignoring potential demobilizing contact effects for minority members. Using two cross-sectional general population surveys (European Social Survey in 22 countries, Swiss MOSAiCH), we address these criticisms by examining whether ethnic majority members' positive contact influences ethnic minority members' support for ingroup rights at the social context level. Applying multilevel path analysis, we show that minority members are more likely to support anti-discrimination laws and immigrant rights when living in social contexts in which majority members have positive intergroup contact experiences. Theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed for understanding how minority groups are affected by the climate of the social context they reside in.

We conducted two experimental field interventions (Ns = 247 and 247) to test models that integrate different levels of categorization. Each of the tested models was contrasted against a no-intervention control condition. In both studies, we assessed effects shortly after the intervention (1 week later; i.e., posttest) and then after approximately 6 months (i.e., follow-up). In the first study, results generally supported the model where categorization precedes decategorization, showing effects on major dependent measures highlighted in research on intergroup contact: quantity and quality of contact, cross-group friendships, intergroup anxiety (marginal effect at follow-up), outgroup attitudes (only at follow-up). Evidence for follow-up effects for this model was, however, weaker in Study 2, where the delayed effects of the intervention emerged only indirectly, via changes in contact quality, outgroup attitudes, and approach behavioral intentions at posttest.

We also examined a novel mediating mechanism that underlies this effect, namely accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for intergroup contact. Three annual waves of survey data were used from 1,169 adolescents (Mage = 13.88 at Wave 1; 50% girls; 66% White British, 44% Asian British) whose schools were merged, in a unique intervention that resulted in one school where ethnic groups were evenly mixed (i.e., balanced school) and two White British majority schools (i.e., majority skewed schools). Results showed that positive intergroup contact and attitudes improved more in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. In all schools, change in adolescents’ positive intergroup contact predicted change in positive intergroup attitudes indirectly via (a) increased accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for contact and (b) reduced intergroup anxiety. Indirect effects via accuracy of perceived contact willingness were stronger for adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts than for other adolescents. These moderated mediation effects were stronger in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. Thus, more balanced ethnic mixing in schools seemed to directly enhance positive intergroup relations and attitudes for all adolescents, but to particularly benefit adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts about positive contact before the school merger © 2021 American Psychological Association","Accuracy of perceived contact willingness; Affective forecasting; Ethnic mixing; Intergroup anxiety; Positive intergroup contact","Adolescent; Adolescent Development; Attitude; Ethnic Groups; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; adolescent; adolescent development; attitude; ethnic group; female; group process; human; human relation; male","","","","","Open Science Framework; Leverhulme Trust; British Academy; Royal Society","The research described in this article was funded by the following grants from The Leverhulme Trust: “Ethno-religious diversity and trust in residential and educational settings” to Miles Hewstone, and “Intergroup Contact and Integration: A multi-method evaluation of three inter-ethnic school mergers” to Miles Hewstone and Katharina Schmid.

Yet, critics suggested that its efficacy is undermined, even eliminated, under certain conditions. Specifically, contact may be ineffective in the face of threat, especially to (historically) advantaged groups, and discrimination, experienced especially by (historically) disadvantaged groups. We considered perceived intergroup threat and perceived discrimination as potential moderators of the effect of contact on prejudice. Two meta-analyses of correlational data from 34 studies (totaling 63, 945 respondents—drawn from 67 subsamples across 19 countries) showed that contact was associated with decreased prejudice and increased out-group positivity, in cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, among advantaged and disadvantaged group members, and in both Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) and non-WEIRD contexts. Both perceived threat and perceived discrimination moderated the contact–attitude association, but in an unanticipated direction. Indeed, contact’s beneficial effects were at least as strong among individuals high (r =.19) as among individuals low (r =.18) in perceived threat. Similarly, the effects of contact were at least as strong among those high (r =.23) as among those low (r =.20) in perceived discrimination. We conclude that contact is effective for promoting tolerant societies because it is effective even among subpopulations where achieving that goal might be most challenging. © 2023 American Psychological Association","discrimination; intergroup contact; intergroup relations; prejudice; threat","Attitude; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Motivation; Prejudice; attitude; cross-sectional study; human; human relation; motivation; prejudice","","","","","Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO; Leverhulme Trust; NORFACE; Max Planck Instituut voor Psycholinguïstiek","This research was partly supported by a senior postdoctoral research grant from the Research Foundation\u2014Flanders (FWO) awarded to Jasper Van Assche (FWO.3E0.2021.0085.01) under the supervision of Arne Roets.

Participants were ethnic majority (Italian) and minority (immigrant) high school students (N = 485; age ranging from 14 to 22 years old, Mage = 17.24 years), who were asked to watch and evaluate videos created by peers from their school for a competition for the best video on intercultural friendships. Results revealed that vicarious contact, relative to a control condition where participants were not shown any videos, improved outgroup attitudes, reduced negative outgroup stereotypes, and increased willingness to engage in contact with the outgroup. These effects only emerged when intercultural friendships in the videos were salient. Inclusion of the other in the self, but neither intergroup anxiety nor fear of rejection by the outgroup, significantly mediated the effect of the videos on outcomes.

Firstly, it introduces the concept of contact-valence into this relationship; that is, whether contact is experienced positively or negatively. Secondly, it presents a comparative analysis of how processes of out-group exposure and frequency of (valenced) contact affect prejudice across both neighbourhoods and workplaces. Applying path analysis modelling to a nationally-representative sample of white British individuals in England, we demonstrate, across both contexts, that increasing out-group exposure is associated with higher rates of both positively- and negatively-valenced contact. This results in exposure exhibiting both positive and negative indirect associations with prejudice via more frequent inter-group mixing. These countervailing contact-pathways help explain how out-group exposure is associated with inter-group attitudes. In neighbourhoods, increasing numbers of individuals experiencing positive-contact suppress an otherwise negative effect of neighbourhood diversity (driven partly by increasing numbers of individuals reporting negative contact). Across workplaces the effect differs such that increasing numbers of individuals experiencing negative-contact suppress an otherwise positive effect of workplace diversity (driven largely by increasing numbers of individuals experiencing positive contact). © 2017, The Author(s).","Communities; Ethnic diversity; Negative contact; Positive contact; Prejudice; Workplaces","England; United Kingdom; ethnic group; neighborhood; public attitude; workplace","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/L011255/1); Leverhulme Trust, (F08 594/B)","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (Grant Number: ES/L011255/1) and by the Leverhulme Trust (Grant Number: F08 594/B).

We analysed data from a week-long diary study (Study 1; N = 83) and a longitudinal study (Study 2; N = 87) with three waves separated by 1 year. Results showed that positive contact can be associated with a reduction in, or even a cancelling out of, the association between negative contact and lower well-being and ingroup affect (buffering effect). We also found that negative contact was associated with higher ingroup ties only among those with higher levels of positive contact (facilitation effect). Results reveal the potential of positive contact to reduce the adverse effects of negative contact on disadvantaged group members’ outcomes, and its potential to facilitate nonharmful effects. © The Author(s) 2024.","disability; disabled people; health and well-being; intergroup contact; social identity","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (PD/BD/128323/2017)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia (Grant No. PD/BD/128323/2017), Portugal.

Although the valuable role of institutional support, one of the initial optimal conditions for contact, has been demonstrated, the impact of actual immigration integration policies, as a manifestation of institutional support, remains unknown. In the current study, we examine how country-level migrant integration policies, assessed by the MIPEX indicator, shape the relationship between everyday contact and threat perceptions associated to immigration. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted with European Social Survey Round 7 data from 20 European countries (N = 32,093 citizens). Everyday contact was related to less symbolic and realistic threat perceptions. Moreover, on the country level, tolerant policies (a high MIPEX score) were related to higher everyday contact and lower symbolic threat perceptions. Confirming that institutional support facilitates the effects of contact, a cross-level interaction revealed that the link between everyday contact and symbolic threat was stronger in high rather than low MIPEX countries. The pattern of results was partially replicated when contact quality and cross-group friendships were assessed, though integration policies did not moderate the effects of these intergroup contact measures. These findings extend the body of multilevel contact research and are crucial for application as they show that integration policies have the potential to guide national majority members’ perceptions regarding immigrants. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ESS; Intergroup contact; MIPEX; multilevel; norms; symbolic and realistic threat","Europe; immigrant; immigration policy; perception; policy approach; public attitude; regression analysis","","","","","National Center of Competence in Research nccr, (51NF40-142020); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (100014_159336)","This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation [Division 1 grant number 100014_159336 and National Center of Competence in Research nccr–on the move grant number 51NF40-142020].","Aberson C.L., Positive Intergroup Contact, Negative Intergroup Contact, and Threat as Predictors of Cognitive and Affective Dimensions of Prejudice, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 18, 6, pp. 743-760, (2015); Aberson C.L., Gaffney A.M., An Integrated Threat Model of Explicit and Implicit Attitudes, European Journal of Social Psychology, 39, 5, pp. 808-830, (2009); (2017); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Ariely G., Do Those Who Identify with Their Nation Always Dislike Immigrants?

Recent work has taken a broader view of contact processes and effects. We review key developments over the past 20 years, identifying different forms of contact, factors that mediate and moderate the effects of contact, and both the nature and temporal stage and the varied outcomes of contact. We then identify several research directions to address pressing theoretical and practical issues. These issues concern (a) group processes and intergroup relations, (b) intergroup contact in the context of multiple categorization, (c) structural- and individual-level processes, (d) a broader range of individual-level outcomes (e.g., health), and (e) impact on social change. Contact theory and research provides a comprehensive conceptual foundation, allied to a range of powerful empirical techniques, for important new advances and practical applications for improving intergroup relations and producing more equitable outcomes across groups. © The Author(s) 2017.","bias; categorization; collective action; contact theory; group processes; health disparities; intergroup contact; intergroup relations; prejudice; prejudice reduction","","","","","","National Institutes of Health; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, (2RO1HL085631-06); Directorate for Education and Human Resources, EHR, (1310757); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/N018893/1); National Stroke Foundation; Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This paper was written with financial support from the Economic & Social Research Council (to Miles Hewstone), NIH/ NHLBI (2RO1HL085631-06) and NSF (1310757) grants (to John F.

This study introduces contact capacity as a factor that may impede intergroup contact. Longitudinal social network data (N = 6,600; Mage = 14.87 years) was collected in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden and used to accurately calculate participants’ out-group, in-group, and total contact. Multilevel models (L1: students, L2: school classes) showed that the total amount of contact at Wave 1 negatively predicts individuals’ out-group friends at Wave 2 while controlling for out-group attitudes, existing out-group friendships and sociodemographic variables.

Two studies investigated the effects of negative as well as positive intergroup contact. Study 1 (n = 482) found that negative but not positive contact with heterosexual people was associated with sexual-minority students’ engagement in collective action (via group identification and perceived discrimination). Among heterosexual students, positive and negative contacts were associated with, respectively, more and less LGB (lesbian, gay, bisexual) activism. Study 2 (N = 1,469) found that only negative contact (via perceived discrimination) predicted LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) students’ collective action intentions longitudinally while only positive contact predicted heterosexual/cisgender students’ LGBT activism.

In Study 1, we showed that positive and negative contact are related to specific episodic intergroup emotions (i.e., anger, fear and happiness). Results of Study 2 indicate an indirect effect of episodic intergroup emotions encountered during contact experiences on specific behavioral tendencies directed at outgroup members via more chronic situation-independent intergroup emotions. As expected, anger predicted approaching (discriminatory) behavioral tendencies (i.e., aggression) while fear predicted avoidance. The results extend the existing literature on intergroup contact and emotions by addressing positive and negative contact simultaneously and differentiating between situation-specific episodic and chronic intergroup emotions in predicting discriminatory behavioral tendencies. © 2017 Kauff, Asbrock, Wagner, Pettigrew, Hewstone, Schäfer and Christ.","Intergroup behavior; Intergroup contact; Intergroup emotions","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/N018893/1)","","Aberson C.L., Positive intergroup contact, negative intergroup contact, and threat as predictors of cognitive and affective dimensions of prejudice, Group Process.

Study 1 examined the effects of direct contact, extended contact, and parasocial contact through mass-media, assessing separately contact through TV news and newspapers and contact through entertainment programs. Study 2 analyzed the distinct effects of positive and negative episodes of the contact forms considered in Study 1. Across the studies, we tested the mediational role of intergroup anxiety, empathy, and trust. Overall, results showed the importance of taking into account different forms of contact and considering the emotional processes during contact experiences to understand intergroup attitudes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc","","anxiety; empathy; human; human experiment; immigrant; Italy; perception; prejudice; trust","","","","","","","Aberson C.L., Positive intergroup contact, negative intergroup contact, and threat as predictors of cognitive and affective dimensions of prejudice, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 18, pp. 743-760, (2015); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Andrighetto L., Mari S., Volpato C., Behluli B., Reducing competitive victimhood in Kosovo: The role of extended contact and common ingroup identity, Political Psychology, 33, pp. 513-529, (2012); Armstrong G.B., Neuendorf K.A., TV Entertainment, news, and racial perceptions of college students, Journal of Communication, 42, pp. 153-176, (1992); Bagozzi R.P., Heatherton T.F., A general approach to representing multifaceted personality constructs: Application to state selfesteem, Structural Equation Modeling, 1, pp. 35-67, (1994); Bandura A., Moral disengagement in the perpetration of inhumanities, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, pp. 193-209, (1999); Barlow F.K., Paolini S., Pedersen A., Hornsey M.J., Radke H.R.M., Harwood J., Et al., The contact caveat: Negative contact predicts increased prejudice more than positive contact predicts reduced prejudice, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 38, pp. 1629-1643, (2012); Batson C.D., The altruism question: Toward a social-psychological answer, (1991); Baussano L.F., Racism and related discriminatory practices in Italy, (2012); Bekhuis H., Ruiter S., Coenders M., Xenophobia among youngsters: The effect of inter-ethnic contact, European Sociological Review, 29, pp. 229-242, (2013); Bilali R., Vollhardt J.R., Priming effects of a reconciliation radio drama on historical perspective-taking in the aftermath of mass violence in Rwanda, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 49, pp. 144-151, (2013); Boomgaarden H.G., Vliegenthart R., How news content influences anti-immigration attitudes: Germany, 1993–2005, European Journal of Political Research, 48, pp. 516-542, (2009); Brader T., Valentino N.A., Suhay E., What triggers public opposition to immigration?

Two studies examined the associations between intergroup contact of migrants and their collective action in support of their or other group members, by testing the mediating role of positive and negative emotions towards natives. Hypotheses were tested with two samples of first-generation, legal African migrants living in Italy for less than 3 years (Ns = 242 [118 males], 251 [154]). Negative contact was positively associated with collective action in support of one's group, especially among respondents with higher positive intergroup experiences, and anger towards native people mediated this association. The association of positive contact with collective action to foster a more egalitarian society in general was mediated by reduced fear towards native people, and the association between positive contact and collective action at large was stronger for migrants with lower negative intergroup contact. Overall, this research provides further evidence on the impact of intergroup contact on migrants, specifically on the role of affective factors in their association with migrants' willingness to engage in collective action to reduce societal inequality at large. © 2023 The Authors.

We employ multilevel structural equation modelling, with individuals nested in neighbourhoods, using a unique dataset collected in England in 2017 amongst 1,520 White British and 1,474 Asian British respondents. Our results show that negative interethnic contact, unlike positive interethnic contact, is not related to ethnic neighbourhood composition. Specifically, White British people who live in neighbourhoods with relatively many Asian British people have, as expected, more positive but, encouragingly, not more negative interethnic contact. For Asian people, living in neighbourhoods with relatively many White people is unrelated to both their positive and negative interethnic contact. Furthermore, White and Asian people who have more positive interethnic contact score higher on perceived cohesion, general trust, and outgroup trust and lower on prejudice. The opposite holds true for White and Asian people who have more negative interethnic contact.  © 2020 The Author(s).

We lack an advanced understanding of contact seeking because intergroup contact is often an independent variable in research, and studies on contact seeking have favoured experimental probing of selected factors or measured only broad behavioural intentions. This research carried out the first ecological tests of a novel multilayer-multivariate framework to contact seeking/avoiding. These tests were centred on a Muslim-led community contact-based initiative with visible support from local authorities following a terrorist attack. Non-Muslim Australian women (N = 1,347) contributed field data on their situated contact motivations, choices, and attendance at an intercultural educational stall; many (N = 559) completed a profiling test battery. Among those who responded to the initiative invite, the rate of taking up the high-salience contact opportunity in this heated setting was high and reflected multiple approach/avoidance motivations. Contact seeking/avoiding was not just allophilia/prejudice; it presented as new typologies of politicized solidarity, courage, apathy, and moral outrage. While intergroup predictors were significant across all profiling analyses, intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors also regularly contributed to explain variance in non-Muslims’ contact motivations and choices, confirming their multilayer-multivariate nature. © 2021 The British Psychological Society","","Apathy; Australia; Courage; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Islam; Morals; Prejudice; Social Cohesion; adult; apathy; article; Australian; avoidance behavior; controlled study; courage; human; major clinical study; morality; motivation; Muslim; prejudice; protein fingerprinting; solidarity; terrorism; Australia; female; human relation; Islam; morality","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (1050313, DP150102210); Australian Research Council, ARC; Australian Psychological Society, APS","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Australian Research Council (DP150102210) and Professor Daphne Keats Endowment Fund (1050313).

Unlike live poker, players and watchers, typically cannot rely on physical cues of other players; in fact, the only information often available to poker players is others’ nationality. Because these poker games often involve members of different national groups, it constitutes a context of indirect contact that has considerable potential to examine how attitudes and beliefs about people from other nationalities can be influenced by interactions in online poker. In the current research, we examined how observing an in-group player have positive or negative contact with a player of another nationality impacted one’s own attitudes and beliefs about the out-group nation. Participants (N = 157) watched an online poker video recording of a fellow in-group member have negative, positive, or no intergroup contact with an out-group member at an online poker table. Subsequent affective (out-group attitudes) and cognitive (perceived out-group variability) measures of intergroup bias were taken. Data revealed that while observing negative contact increased out-group prejudice, observing positive contact reduced prejudice (all relative to no intergroup contact). However, no differences were found in perceived out-group variability. Implications for online poker and future research intergroup contact are discussed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","negative contact; online poker; out-group variability; positive contact; prejudice; vicarious contact","adult; article; human; human experiment; intergroup bias; major clinical study; prejudice; videorecording","","","","","University of Canterbury, UC","This research was supported by an internal grant from the Department of Psychology at the University of Canterbury awarded to the first and second authors.","Aberson C.L., Positive intergroup contact, negative intergroup contact, and threat as predictors of cognitive and affective dimensions of prejudice, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 18, 6, pp. 743-760, (2015); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Intergroup contact as a tool for reducing, resolving, and preventing intergroup conflict: Evidence, limitations, and potential, American Psychologist, 68, 7, (2013); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Alvidrez S., Pineiro-Naval V., Marcos-Ramos M., Rojas-Solis J., Intergroup contact in computer-mediated communication: The interplay of a stereotype-disconfirming behavior and a lasting group identity on reducing prejudiced perceptions, Computers in Human Behavior, 52, pp. 533-540, (2015); Barlow F.K., Paolini S., Pedersen A., Hornsey M.J., Radke H.R., Harwood J., Sibley C.G., The contact caveat negative contact predicts increased prejudice more than positive contact predicts reduced prejudice, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 38, 12, pp. 1629-1643, (2012); Converse J.M., Presser S., Survey questions: Handcrafting the standardized questionnaire (No. 63), (1986); Crisp R.J., Turner R.N., Can imagined interactions produce positive perceptions?: Reducing prejudice through simulated social contact, American Psychologist, 64, 4, pp. 231-240, (2009); Davies K., Tropp L., Aron A., Pettigrew T.F., Wright S.C., Cross-group friendships and intergroup attitudes: A meta-analytic review, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 15, 4, pp. 332-351, (2011); Davy L., The poker revolution on twitch, (2017); Dovidio J.F., Eller A., Hewstone M., Improving intergroup relations through direct, extended and other forms of indirect contact, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 14, 2, pp. 147-160, (2011); Fiedler I., Wilcke A.C., The market for online poker, Available at SSRN, (2011); Graf S., Paolini S., Rubin M., Negative intergroup contact is more influential, but positive intergroup contact is more common: Assessing contact prominence and contact prevalence in five Central European countries, European Journal of Social Psychology, 44, 6, pp. 536-547, (2014); Harkins S.G., Petty R.E., Information utility and the multiple source effect, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 52, pp. 260-268, (1987); Harwood J., Hewstone M., Amichai-Hamburger Y., Tausch N., Intergroup contact: An integration of social psychological and communication perspectives, Communication yearbook 36, pp. 55-102, (2013); Harwood J., Joyce N., Chen C.Y., Paolini S., Xiang J., Rubin M., Effects of past and present intergroup communication on perceived fit of an outgroup member and desire for future intergroup contact, Communication Research, 44, 4, pp. 530-555, (2017); Hewstone M., Hamberger J., Perceived variability and stereotype change, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 103-124, (2000); Hsueh M., Yogeeswaran K., Malinen S., “Leave your comment below”: Can biased online comments influence our own prejudicial attitudes and behaviors?, Human Communication Research, 41, 4, pp. 557-576, (2015); Ingen C.V., Poker face: Gender, race and representation in online poker, Leisure/loisir, 32, 1, pp. 3-20, (2008); Islam M.R., Hewstone M., Dimensions of contact as predictors of intergroup anxiety, perceived outgroup variability, and outgroup attitude: An integrative model, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 19, pp. 700-710, (1993); Joyce N., Harwood J., Improving intergroup attitudes through televised vicarious intergroup contact: Social cognitive processing of ingroup and outgroup information, Communication Research, 41, 5, pp. 627-643, (2014); Kim J., Park H.S., The effect of uniform virtual appearance on conformity intention: Social identity model of deindividuation effects and optimal distinctiveness theory, Computers in Human Behavior, 27, 3, pp. 1223-1230, (2011); Lang R.D., Online gambling: With state regulation, all bets are off-the need for Federal regulation, Law School Student Scholarship, (2014); Lemmer G., Wagner U., Can we really reduce ethnic prejudice outside the lab?

We examined whether characteristics of communication media that facilitate intergroup encounters shape its effect on out-group attitudes. Specifically, we propose that concealing individuating cues about out-group members during CMIC increases prejudice, as interaction partners are perceived as less socially present. To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice. In conclusion, CMIC can contribute to conflict resolution interventions, preparing individuals for direct intergroup contact, if its affordances or conversation topics enhance interaction partners' social presence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anonymity; Computer-mediated communication; Intergroup contact; Prejudice; Social presence","Human computer interaction; Anonymity; Computer mediated communication; Intergroup contacts; Prejudice; Social presence; adult; conflict; conversation; factorial design; human; prejudice; Behavioral research","","","","","Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique Belgium; Wiener-Anspach Foundation Belgium","This work was supported by an Aspirant /Doctoral research fellowship by the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique Belgium (2010–2014) as well as a post-doctoral fellowship by the Wiener-Anspach Foundation Belgium (2014–2016) that were awarded to the first author.

South Indian participants (N = 351) from diverse caste backgrounds viewed 24 identity cards, each representing a person with whom participants shared none, one, two, or all of three group memberships (caste, religion, nationality). Participants judged each person as “us” or “not us,” showing whom they included in their ingroup, and whom they excluded. Participants tended to exclude caste and religious minorities, replicating persistent social divides. Bridging these divides, cross-group friendship was associated with more inclusive identities which, in turn, were associated with more positive relations between an advantaged, an intermediate, and a disadvantaged caste group. Negative contact was associated with less inclusive identities. Contact and identity processes, however, did not affect entrenched opposition to (or undermine support for) affirmative action in advantaged and disadvantaged groups. © The Author(s) 2020.","affirmative action; intergroup contact; interminority relations; multiple categorization; perceived discrimination; social identity","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by an Economic and Social Research Council, Advanced Quantitative Methods studentship to the first author.

Perceived personal discrimination and relative deprivation in comparison to the majority group are assessed as mediators of the associations between intergroup contact and psychological well-being. Method: We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study with newcomer African immigrants living in Italy (N = 240; 61.7% men) with age ranging from 18 to 40 years old. Results: Evidence showed that, across three waves, immigrants’ negative contact with Italian natives was longitudinally associated with lower well-being and positive intergroup contact. In turn, well-being was related to immigrants’ lower perceptions of relative deprivation across waves. Positive contact with Italian natives was not significantly associated with immigrants’ well-being, but it was associated with higher perceived relative deprivation, which was associated with lower well-being. Conclusions: Overall, the results provide insight into the links between differently valenced contact and the psychological well-being of newcomer immigrants. Furthermore, the findings address assumptions about the primacy of negative contact in undermining social attitudes and the important role of positive contact in promoting awareness of the disadvantaged group’s situation. © 2024 American Psychological Association","immigration; intergroup contact; intergroup discrimination; relative deprivation; well-being","adult; article; awareness; controlled study; disadvantaged population; female; human; immigrant; immigration; indigenous people; Italy; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; psychological adjustment; psychological well-being; social attitude; social psychology; wellbeing","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (790318)","","Agostini M., van Zomeren M., Toward a comprehensive and potentially cross-cultural model of why people engage in collective action: A quantitative research synthesis of four motivations and structural constraints, Psychological Bulletin, 147, 7, pp. 667-700, (2021); Albert S., Sabini J., Attributions about systems in slow vs. rapid change, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 1, 1, pp. 91-93, (1974); Allport G.

There is a need for further research in these contexts on the potential inhibitors of contact (such as diversity and threat) and their effects. Perceived social diversity has been implicated in the deterioration of intergroup relations. This is particularly salient in the context of immigrant relations, where anti-immigrant sentiments are characterized by perceived threat and lower outgroup trust. Diversity can, however, have an indirect positive effect on outgroup attitudes, via intergroup contact, which reliably predicts lower perceived threat and prejudice. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that empathy could mitigate negative attitudes towards immigrants. We investigated the relationship between perceived neighbourhood diversity, cross-group friendships, realistic and symbolic threat, empathic responding, trust, and outgroup orientation within the volatile context of Black (African) South Africans’ relations with African immigrants. Survey data were collected from South Africans (N = 317) living in a township. Structural equation modelling showed that perceived diversity was significantly positively associated with both realistic threat (which was significantly negatively associated with outgroup trust) and cross-group friendships (which was significantly negatively associated with realistic threat). There was a significant indirect association between cross-group friendships and positive orientation towards African immigrants via empathic responding towards African immigrants. These findings suggest that cross-group friendships and empathy might mitigate the negative impact of diversity and threat on attitudes towards immigrants, even in this demanding context. © The Author(s) 2022.","Contact hypothesis; diversity; empathy; immigrants; prejudice; threat","","","","","","","","Bai X., Ramos M.R., Fiske S.T., As diversity increases, people paradoxically perceive social groups as more similar, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 117, pp. 12741-12749, (2020); Batson C.D., Ahmad N.Y., Using empathy to improve intergroup attitudes and relations, Social Issues and Policy Review, 3, pp. 141-177, (2009); Batson C.D., Early S., Salvarani G., Perspective taking: Imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, pp. 751-758, (1997); Batson C.D., Polycarpou M.P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Mitchener E.C., Bednar L.L., Klein T.R., Highberger L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings toward the group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 1, pp. 105-118, (1997); Blalock H.M., Per cent non-white and discrimination in the South, American Sociological Review, 22, pp. 677-682, (1957); Bogardus E.S., A social distance scale, Sociology and Social Research, 17, pp. 265-271, (1933); Christ O., Schmid K., Lolliot S., Swart H., Stolle D., Tausch N., Hewstone M., Contextual effect of positive intergroup contact on outgroup prejudice, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111, pp. 3996-4000, (2014); Clarke C.G., Antonio A.L., Rethinking research on the impact of racial diversity in higher education, The Review of Higher Education, 36, pp. 25-50, (2012); Cortland C.I., Craig M.A., Shapiro J.R., Richeson J.A., Neel R., Goldstein N.J., Solidarity through shared disadvantage: Highlighting shared experiences of discrimination improves relations between stigmatized groups, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 113, 4, pp. 547-567, (2017); Crush J., The perfect storm: The realities of xenophobia in contemporary South Africa, (2009); Crush J., Pendleton W., Regionalizing xenophobia?

Online evaluations of goods provide a naturalistic context in which to investigate social influence. We collected information from 20,397 notes about 209 wines posted on a wine social networking site over the course of 10 years to examine the social influence on wine evaluations. Our analyses provide evidence for both normative and informational social influence on online wine evaluations. However, normative influence outweighs the effect of judgements made by experts. The influence of prior evaluations is strongest for the first few individuals who post their notes, and social influence increases as a function of source uniformity. Furthermore, expert members' evaluations are not more influential than other individuals' evaluations. Our results provide evidence for significant effects of social influence in an applied setting, impacting wine consumers that are exposed to the opinions of others, and have implications for how goods are advertised online.

We tested this claim in five studies, using data from five countries, two types of contexts, a range of measures, and involving different minority versus majority groups. Using multilevel cross-level interaction models, we considered whether effects of contact on outgroup attitudes were moderated by relative outgroup size. Results failed to replicate the previously reported findings, revealing, by and large, nonsignificant cross-level moderation effects; instead, we witnessed consistent positive contact effects on attitudes. Findings are discussed against the backdrop of recent research on the consequences of diversity, as well as context-based considerations regarding minority versus majority constellations. We also discuss some exceptions to our findings that emerged for some respondent groups and contexts across the five studies. © 2017, © 2017 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","diversity;

In study 1, out-group friendship at time 1 predicted out-group trust at time 2 (one year later), controlling for prior out-group trust. In study 2, positive and negative intergroup emotions mediated the effects of friendship on positive and negative behavioral tendencies and attitudes. In study 3, a confirmatory factor analysis indicated that trust and emotions are distinct constructs with unique predictive contributions. We then tested a model in which cross-group friendship predicted intergroup emotions and trust through intimate self-disclosure in out-group friendships.

Using data from 6,089 individuals in England matched to census-based statistical estimates for 300 local areas, we find that religious diversity is negatively associated with neighbourhood trust. Further analyses tested indirect relationships between religious diversity and neighbourhood trust to examine whether higher levels of religious diversity are associated with a stronger sense of religious identity, and whether a stronger sense of religious identity is associated with lower levels of neighbourhood trust. We simultaneously tested whether higher levels of religious diversity are associated with a weaker sense of national identity, and whether a weaker sense of national identity is associated with lower neighbourhood trust. Multigroup analyses were conducted to assess patterns across religious groups. Results indicate that, for Christians, religious diversity is associated with a stronger subordinate religious identification, which is in turn associated with lower neighbourhood trust. There were no associations between religious diversity, national identification, and neighbourhood trust. For the other religious groups, no significant associations were found between our variables of interest. We discuss the relevance and implication of increasing religious diversity in societies for the multiple groups involved. © The Author(s) 2021.","contextual effects; national identity; neighbourhood trust; religious diversity; religious identity; trust","","","","","","","","Abascal M., Baldassarri D., Love thy neighbor?

Although intergroup contact has been shown to improve intergroup relations, conventional methods leave some questions unanswered regarding the underlying social mechanisms that facilitate social cohesion between different groups in increasingly diverse societies. We will therefore explain the largely unknown conceptual and methodological advantages of social network analysis for studying intergroup contact in naturally existing groups, which are likely to help contact researchers to gain a better understanding of intergroup relations and guide attempts to overcome segregation, prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict. © 2017 The British Psychological Society","diversity; intergroup contact; social network analysis","Group Processes; Humans; Psychology, Social; Social Support; human; organization; prejudice; scientist; social network; sociology; group process; procedures; social psychology; social support","","","","","","","Baumeister R.F., Leary M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529, (1995); Baumeister R.F., Vohs K.D., Funder D.C., Psychology as the science of self-reports and finger movements: Whatever happened to actual behavior?, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 2, pp. 396-403, (2007); Borgatti S.P., Mehra A., Brass D.J., Labianca G., Network analysis in the social science, Science, 323, pp. 892-895, (2009); Byrne D., The attraction paradigm, (1971); Davies K., Tropp L.R., Aron A., Pettigrew T.F., Wright S.C., Cross-group friendships and intergroup attitudes: A meta-analytic review, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 15, pp. 332-351, (2011); Dunbar R.I.M., Coevolution of neocortical size, group size and language in humans, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 16, pp. 681-735, (1993); Echols L., Graham S., Birds of a different feather: How do cross-ethnic friends flock together?, Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 59, pp. 461-488, (2013); Frederickson N.L., Furnham A.F., Sociometric classification methods in school peer groups: A comparative investigation, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 39, pp. 921-933, (1998); Freeman L.C., Centrality in social networks: Conceptual clarification, Social Networks, 1, pp. 215-239, (1979); Graf S., Paolini S., Rubin M., Negative intergroup contact is more influential, but positive intergroup contact is more common: Assessing contact prominence and contact prevalence in five Central European countries, European Journal of Social Psychology, 44, pp. 536-547, (2014); Hewstone M., Judd C.M., Sharp M., Do observer ratings validate self-reports of intergroup contact?

Based on the deprovincialization hypothesis and Social Dominance Theory, we hypothesized that the indirect effect of cross-group friendship on outgroup attitudes via reduced ingroup identification is moderated by individuals' Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), and occurs only for members of high status majority groups. We tested these predictions in three different intergroup contexts, involving conflictual relations between social groups in Germany (Study 1; N = 150; longitudinal Study 2: N = 753), Northern Ireland (Study 3: N = 160; Study 4: N = 1,948), and England (Study 5; N = 594). Cross-group friendship was associated with reduced ingroup identification and the link between reduced ingroup identification and improved outgroup attitudes was moderated by SDO (the indirect effect of cross-group friendship on outgroup attitudes via reduced ingroup only occurred for individuals scoring high, but not low, in SDO). Although there was a consistent moderating effect of SDO in high-status majority groups (Studies 1-5), but not lowstatus minority groups (Studies 3, 4, and 5), the interaction by SDO was not reliably stronger in high-than low-status groups. Findings are discussed in terms of better understanding deprovincialization effects of contact. Copyright © 2016 Kauff et al.

During the Italian lockdown, we conducted an online survey with 685 Italian participants investigating whether perceptions of common belonging (belonging to a common group, sharing a common destiny, perceiving the difficulties faced by other groups) with disadvantaged and national outgroups were associated with perceived COVID-19 threat and prejudice-related individual differences, namely social dominance orientation (SDO), need for cognitive closure (NFC), deprovincialization, pre-lockdown positive and negative face-to-face contact with immigrants. We also explored the moderating roles of individual differences in the link between perceived threat and perceptions of common belonging. Results showed that common belonging was negatively associated with COVID-19 perceived threat, SDO, and NFC, and positively associated with deprovincialization and positive contact, with differences depending on the common belonging index and on the type of outgroup. Moderations showed that negative relationships between common belonging and COVID-19 threat held only at low levels of NFC (floor effect), deprovincialization, and positive contact. Summarizing, positive contact with minorities and openness to other cultures can favor a sense of communion with other social groups in a global health emergency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Common belonging; Common group; COVID-19; Deprovincialization; Intergroup contact; Intergroup relations; Social dominance orientation; Threat","","","","","","","","Aiello A., Chirumbolo A., Leone L., Pratto F., Uno studio di adattamento e validazione della scala di orientamento/tendenza alla dominanza sociale [A study for the validation of the social dominance orientation scale], Rassegna di Psicologia, 22, pp. 65-75, (2005); Arnadottir K., Lolliot S., Brown R., Hewstone M., Positive and negative intergroup contact: Interaction not asymmetry, European Journal of Social Psychology, 48, 6, pp. 784-800, (2018); Boin J., Fuochi G., Voci A., Deprovincialization as a key correlate of ideology, prejudice, and intergroup contact, Personality and Individual Differences, 157, (2020); Business leader, Just when Italy really needed some unity, the EU failed it – And continues to do so, (2020); Capozza D., Trifiletti E., Vezzali L., Favara I., Can intergroup contact improve humanity attributions?, International Journal of Psychology, 48, 4, pp. 527-541, (2013); Cuddy A.J., Fiske S.T., Glick P., Warmth and competence as universal dimensions of social perception: The stereotype content model and the BIAS map, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 40, pp. 61-149, (2008); Devakumar D., Shannon G., Bhopal S.S., Abubakar I., Racism and discrimination in COVID-19 responses, The Lancet, 395, 10231, (2020); Dovidio J.F., Ikizer E.G., Kunst J.R., Levy A., Common identity and humanity, Together apart: The psychology of COVID-19, pp. 142-146, (2020); Faulkner J., Schaller M., Park J.H., Duncan L.A., Evolved disease-avoidance mechanisms and contemporary xenophobic attitudes, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 7, 4, pp. 333-353, (2004); Gaertner S.L., Dovidio J.F., Guerra R., Hehman E., Saguy T., A common ingroup identity: A categorization-based approach for reducing intergroup bias, Handbook of prejudice, discrimination, and stereotyping, pp. 433-454, (2016); Krings F., Green E.T., Bangerter A., Staerkle C., Clemence A., Wagner-Egger P., Bornand T., Preventing contagion with avian influenza: Disease salience, attitudes toward foreigners, and avoidance beliefs, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 42, 6, pp. 1451-1466, (2012); Kruglanski A.W., Pierro A., Mannetti L., De Grada E., Groups as epistemic providers: need for closure and the unfolding of group-centrism, Psychological Review, 113, 1, pp. 84-100, (2006); Murray D.R., Schaller M., Threat(s) and conformity deconstructed: Perceived threat of infectious disease and its implications for conformist attitudes and behavior, European Journal of Social Psychology, 42, 2, pp. 180-188, (2012); Muzi L., As if we were the disease’: Coronavirus brings prejudice for Italy's Chinese workers, (2020); Navarrete C.D., Fessler D.M., Disease avoidance and ethnocentrism: The effects of disease vulnerability and disgust sensitivity on intergroup attitudes, Evolution and Human Behavior, 27, 4, pp. 270-282, (2006); Pettigrew T.F., Deprovincialization, The encyclopedia of peace psychology, (2011); Pierro A., Mannetti L., Converso D., Garsia V., Miglietta A., Ravenna M., Et al., Caratteristiche strutturali della versione italiana della Scala di Bisogno di Chiusura Cognitiva di Webster e Kruglanski [Structural features of the Italian version of Webster and Kruglanski's need for cognitive closure scale], TPM - Testing, Psychometrics, Methodology in Applied Psychology, 2, 2, pp. 125-141, (1995); Reimer N.K., Kamble S.V., Schmid K., Hewstone M., Intergroup contact fosters more inclusive social identities, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, (2020); Reny T.T., Barreto M.A., Xenophobia in the time of pandemic: Othering, anti-Asian attitudes, and COVID-19, Politics, Groups, and Identities, pp. 1-24, (2020); Roberto K.J., Johnson A.F., Rauhaus B.M., Stigmatization and prejudice during the COVID-19 pandemic, Administrative Theory & Praxis, pp. 1-15, (2020); Roets A., Van Hiel A., Item selection and validation of a brief, 15-item version of the need for closure scale, Personality and Individual Differences, 50, 1, pp. 90-94, (2011); Shah J.Y., Kruglanski A.W., Thompson E.P., Membership has its (epistemic) rewards: Need for closure effects on in-group bias, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, 2, pp. 383-393, (1998); Sidanius J., Pratto F., Social dominance: An intergroup theory of social hierarchy and oppression, (1999); Sorokowski P., Groyecka A., Kowal M., Sorokowska A., Bialek M., Lebuda I., Karwowski M., Can information about pandemics increase negative attitudes toward foreign groups?

One argument against the existence of separate schools is that they limit opportunities for children from different groups to engage with each other, promoting intergroup suspicion and sectarianism. Using intergroup contact theory we examine the impact on outgroup attitudes of pupils attending mixed and separate post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. Data were collected through a survey of more than 3,500 pupils and analyses show that, irrespective of school type, intergroup contact at school is strongly associated with more positive orientations to the ethno-religious outgroup. The policy implications of these findings are discussed. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","contact theory; faith schools; inter-group relations; social division","","","","","","Catholic Church and the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools","The post-primary education system is now generally represented as comprising four sectors: controlled, maintained, voluntary and integrated. Controlled schools are fully state-funded and de facto Protestant. They are owned by the Education and Library Boards, the local governing authorities for schools, although management boards (boards of governors) are increasingly taking over this role. Maintained schools are fully state funded, but much control is retained by the Catholic Church and the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools. The schools are owned by the Catholic Church through a system of trustees, and are managed by a board of governors. Recurrent costs are met by the Education and Library Boards. Through Catholic maintained schools, the Catholic Church’s diocesan authorities aim to educate children ‘within and through a Catholic ethos’ (McGlynn, 2005). Voluntary schools are owned by the school trustees and managed by the board of governors, but still receive partial state funding. Schools in this category are generally connected via the board of governors and trustees to Catholic and Protestant churches. Half are Catholic and half are Protestant.","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Batson C.D., Ahmad Y.N., Using empathy to improve intergroup attitudes and relations, Social Issues and Policy Review, 3, pp. 141-177, (2009); Faith schools shouldn't get public cash, (2012); Religious schools: The case against, (2001); Broklehurst H., Who's afraid of children?

This diversity has raised the question of the potential consequences of such diversity for outcomes related to social capital, an issue that remains contentious in both academic and public policy domains alike. As a result there now exists a wealth of studies in many different contexts and countries examining the effects of living in diverse neighborhoods or cities on the growth and distribution of social capital. Despite this research, relatively little is as yet known about the processes and mechanisms that explain how diversity may, or may not, affect social capital. © 2015 selection and editorial matter Ruud Koopmans, Bram Lancee, and Merlin Schaeffer; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Alesina A., La Ferrara E., Who trusts others?, Journal of Public Economics, 85, pp. 207-234, (2002); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Blalock H.M., Percent non-white and discrimination in the South, American Sociological Review, 22, pp. 677-682, (1967); Blumer H., Racial prejudice as a sense of group position, Pacific Sociological Review, 23, pp. 3-7, (1958); Bobo L.D., Prejudice as a sense of group position: Microfoundations of a sociological approach to racism and race relations, Journal of Social Issues, 17, pp. 445-472, (1999); Brewer M.B., Pierce K.P., Social identity complexity and outgroup tolerance, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 428-437, (2005); Brown R.J., Hewstone M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, pp. 255-331, (2005); Christ O., Wagner U., Methodological issues in the study of intergroup contact: Towards a new wave of research, Advances in Intergroup Contact, pp. 223-261, (2012); Cornelius W., Rosenblum M., Immigration and politics, Annual Review of Political Science, 8, pp. 99-119, (2005); Foddy M., Platow M.J., Yamagishi T., Group-based trust in strangers: The role of stereotypes and expectations, Psychological Science, 20, pp. 419-422, (2009); Fosset M.A., Kiecolt K.J., The relative size of minority populations and white racial attitudes, Social Science Quarterly, 70, pp. 820-835, (1989); Gaertner S.L., Dovidio J.F., Reducing intergroup bias: The common ingroup identity model, (2000); Gesthuizen M., van der Meer T., Scheepers P., Ethnic diversity and social capital in Europe: Tests of Putnam’s thesis in European countries, Scandinavian Political Studies, 32, pp. 121-142, (2009); Hero R., Social capital and racial inequality in America, Perspectives on Politics, 1, pp. 113-122, (2003); Hewstone M., Living apart, living together?

Results revealed that responses were more negative toward any veil compared with no veil, and more negative toward the full-face veil relative to the hijab: for emotions felt toward veiled women (Study 1), for non-affective attitudinal responses (Study 2), and for implicit negative attitudes revealed through response latency measures (Studies 3a and 3b). Finally, we manipulated the perceived reasons for wearing a veil, finding that exposure to positive reasons for wearing a veil led to better predicted and imagined contact (Study 4).

The term usually refers to the off-label use of medical substances to improve mental performance in healthy individuals. With the final aim to advance the normative debate taking place on that topic, several empirical studies have been conducted to assess the attitudes toward PCE in the public, i.e., in groups outside of the academic debate. In this review, we provide an overview of the 40 empirical studies published so far, reporting both their methodology and results. Overall, we find that several concerns about the use of PCE are prevalent in the public. These concerns largely match those discussed in the normative academic debate. We present our findings structured around the three most common concerns: medical safety, coercion, and fairness. Fairness is divided into three subthemes: equality of opportunity, honesty, and authenticity. Attitudes regarding some concerns are coherent across studies (e.g., coercion), whereas for others we find mixed results (e.g., authenticity). Moreover, we find differences in how specific groups-such as users, nonusers, students, parents, and health care providers-perceive PCE: a coherent finding is that nonusers display more concerns regarding medical safety and fairness than users. We discuss potential psychological explanations for these differences. © 2014 Schelle, Faulmüller, Caviola and Hewstone.","Authenticity; Brain function augmentation; Coercion; Cognitive enhancement; Fairness; Medical safety; Neuroenhancement; Smart drugs","attitude; brain function; cognition; health care personnel; health care survey; health hazard; human; interview; mental performance; public health problem; questionnaire; review","","","","","","","Aikins R.D., Academic performance enhancement: A qualitative study of the perceptions and habits of prescription stimulant-using college students, J.

Using cross-sectional and longitudinal samples from different intergroup contexts, this research demonstrates that extended contact is most effective when individuals live in segregated neighborhoods having only few, or no, direct friendships with outgroup members. Moreover, by including measures of attitudes and behavioral intentions the authors showed the broader impact of these forms of contact, and, by assessing attitude certainty as one dimension of attitude strength, they tested whether extended contact can lead not only to more positive but also to stronger outgroup orientations. Cross-sectional data showed that direct contact was more strongly related to attitude certainty than was extended contact, but longitudinal data showed both forms of contact affected attitude certainty in the long run. © 2010 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","attitude strength; behavioral intentions; direct contact; extended contact; outgroup attitudes","Attitude; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Germany; Group Processes; Humans; Intention; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Prejudice; Social Identification; Stereotyping; article; attitude; behavior; cross-sectional study; female; Germany; group process; human; human relation; longitudinal study; male; social behavior; social psychology","","","","","","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Cairns E., Hewstone M., Northern Ireland: Ingroup pride and outgroup prejudice, Seven Deadly Sins: A New Look at Society through an Old Lens, pp. 8-12, (2005); Cameron L., Rutland A., Extended contact through story reading in school: Reducing children's prejudice towards the disabled, Journal of Social Issues, 62, pp. 469-488, (2006); Cameron L., Rutland A., Brown R., Douch R., Changing children's intergroup attitudes toward refugees: Testing different models of extended contact, Child Development, 77, pp. 1208-1219, (2006); Dhont K., van Hiel A., We must not be enemies: Interracial contact and the reduction of prejudice among authoritarians, Personality and Individual Differences, 46, pp. 172-177, (2009); Eaton A.A., Majka E.A., Visser P.S., Emerging perspectives on the structure and function of attitude strength, European Review of Social Psychology, 19, pp. 165-201, (2008); Fazio R.H., Multiple processes by which attitudes guide behaviour: The MODE model as an integrative framework, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 23, pp. 75-109, (1990); Fazio R.H., Zanna M.P., On the predictive validity of attitudes: The roles of direct experience and confidence, Journal of Personality, 46, pp. 228-243, (1978); Fazio R.H., Zanna M.P., Direct experience and attitude-behavior consistency, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 14, pp. 161-202, (1981); Finkel S.E., Causal Analysis with Panel Data, (1995); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research, (1975); Gallagher A.M., The approach of government: Community relations and equity, Facets of the Conflict in Northern Ireland, pp. 27-43, (1995); Hewstone M., Living apart, living together?

A recent study found that intervention with propranolol diminished negative implicit racial bias. Materials and method: The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to determine the neural correlates of this effect. Healthy volunteers (N∈=∈40) of white ethnic origin received a single oral dose (40 mg) of propranolol, in a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled design, before viewing unfamiliar faces of same and other race. Results and discussion: We found significantly reduced activity in the fusiform gyrus and thalamus following propranolol to out-group faces only. Additionally, propranolol lowered the implicit attitude score, without affecting explicit prejudice measure. Conclusion: These findings suggest that noradrenaline pathways might modulate racial bias by acting on the processing of categorisation in the fusiform gyrus. © 2015 The Author(s).","Emotion; fMRI","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; African Americans; Attitude; Double-Blind Method; European Continental Ancestry Group; Face; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Photic Stimulation; Prejudice; Propranolol; Temporal Lobe; Young Adult; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; propranolol; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; propranolol; adult; Article; Caucasian; controlled study; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; fusiform gyrus; heart rate; human; human experiment; male; mood; normal human; priority journal; racism; randomized controlled trial; thalamus; African American; attitude; double blind procedure; drug effects; face; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photostimulation; physiology; prejudice; temporal lobe; young adult","","propranolol, 13013-17-7, 318-98-9, 3506-09-0, 4199-09-1, 525-66-6; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists, ; Propranolol, ","","","Wellcome Trust; Wellcome Trust, WT, (WT086041MA, WT087208MF)","We are grateful to the Wellcome Trust for funding part of this research (WT087208MF and WT086041MA).

Great advances have been made in understanding how contact reduces prejudice (Brown & Hewstone, 2005), highlighting the importance of affective mediators (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). The present study, a 3-wave longitudinal study undertaken among minority-status Colored high school children in South Africa (N = 465), explored the full mediation of the effects of cross-group friendships on positive outgroup attitudes, perceived outgroup variability, and negative action tendencies via positive (affective empathy) and negative (intergroup anxiety) affective mediators simultaneously. The target group was the majority-status White South African outgroup. As predicted, a bidirectional model described the relationship between contact, mediators, and prejudice significantly better over time than either autoregressive or unidirectional longitudinal models. However, full longitudinal mediation was only found in the direction from Time 1 contact to Time 3 prejudice (via Time 2 mediators), supporting the underlying tenet of the contact hypothesis. Specifically, cross-group friendships were positively associated with positive outgroup attitudes (via affective empathy) and perceived outgroup variability (via intergroup anxiety and affective empathy) and were negatively associated with negative action tendencies (via affective empathy). Following Pettigrew and Tropp (2008), we compared two alternative hypotheses regarding the relationship between intergroup anxiety and affective empathy over time. Time 1 intergroup anxiety was indirectly negatively associated with Time 3 affective empathy, via Time 2 cross-group friendships. We discuss the theoretical and empirical contributions of this study and make suggestions for future research. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Cross-group friendship; Empathy; Full longitudinal mediation; Intergroup anxiety; Intergroup contact","Adolescent; Affect; African Continental Ancestry Group; Anxiety; Attitude; Empathy; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Friends; Group Processes; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Minority Groups; Prejudice; Social Identification; South Africa; adolescent; affect; anxiety; article; attitude; Caucasian; empathy; female; friend; group process; human; human relation; longitudinal study; male; minority group; Negro; psychological aspect; social behavior; social psychology; South Africa","","","","","","","Aberson C.L., Haag S.C., Contact, perspective-taking, and anxiety as predictors of stereotype endorsement, explicit attitudes, and implicit attitudes, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 10, pp. 179-201, (2007); Allport G., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Amir Y., Contact hypothesis in ethnic relations, Psychological Bulletin, 71, pp. 319-342, (1969); Aron A., Aron E.N., Smollan D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612, (1992); Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe T., Mashek D., Lewandowski G., Wright S.C., Aron E.N., Including others in the self, European review of social psychology, 15, pp. 101-132, (2004); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Batson C.D., Polycarpou M.P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Mitchener E.C., Bednar L.L., Highberger L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings toward the group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 105-118, (1997); Binder J., Zagefka H., Brown R., Funke F., Kessler T., Mummendey A., Leyens J.-P., Does contact reduce prejudice or does prejudice reduce contact?

Subsequent theory and research has developed this hypothesis into a full-blown theory that makes precise predictions about the effects of different types of contact on mainly attitudinal outcomes, and how and when those effects will occur. This chapter reviews some of the most important measures commonly used in research on intergroup contact; those specifically pertaining to intergroup contact (both direct and extended), mediating (intergroup anxiety) and moderating (membership salience) mechanisms, and outcomes (outgroup attitudes). Our aim is that the information assembled here can serve both (a) as a 'toolkit' for the interested novice researcher and (b) as a useful resource to the experienced intergroup contact practitioner regarding the psychometric properties of these commonly used measures. Research on intergroup contact is of great practical and policy importance, hence it behoves us as researchers to take care to use the best possible tools for the job. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, neither the severity of Jamaican anti-gay prejudice, nor any means of reducing this prejudice has ever been empirically investigated. Intergroup contact-social interaction with a person from another group-is one of the most successful and widely used social-psychological interventions to reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. In this article, we compared sexual prejudice in Jamaica to that in Britain and investigated the relationship between contact and sexual prejudice in both countries. Jamaican participants reported more negative attitudes toward gay men than did British participants, but contact was more strongly associated with reduced sexual prejudice for Jamaican participants than for British participants. Implications for reducing Jamaican sexual prejudice are discussed. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","contact hypothesis; homophobia; homosexuality; intergroup contact; intergroup relations; Jamaica; sexual prejudice","Anxiety; Attitude; Culture; Data Collection; Female; Great Britain; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Jamaica; Male; Prejudice; Young Adult; adult; anxiety; article; attitude; cultural anthropology; female; homosexuality; human; human relation; information processing; Jamaica; male; psychological aspect; social psychology; statistics; United Kingdom","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Altemeyer B., Changes in attitudes toward homosexuals, Journal of Homosexuality, 42, 2, pp. 63-75, (2002); Angermeyer M.C., Matschinger H., Social distance towards the mentally ill: results of representative surveys in the Federal Republic of Germany, Psychological Medicine, 27, pp. 131-141, (1997); Araiza W.D., The long arc of justice: Lesbian and gay marriage, equality, and rights, and: gay marriage: For better or for worse?

However, the overwhelming number of publications supporting this claim come from societies in North America and Europe that are relatively free of violent intergroup conflict. After presenting the current state of research, we extend the perspective to intractable conflicts and the role of contact in reducing these kinds of conflicts. We do this by distinguishing between different phases for contact and contact effects, namely a previolence phase, a phase of physical violence, and a postviolence phase. Evidence shows that intergroup contact helps to prevent escalation of intergroup conflict and violence. In addition, recent surveys and interventions support the assumption that intergroup contact, after a phase of violence, can contribute to reconciliation in the form of reducing prejudice and increasing intergroup trust and forgiveness toward the outgroup. Very few studies focus on prior effects of intergroup contact on the conduct of violence, or on the reconciliation process after violence. Data are also sparse regarding effects of contact during phases of violence on postviolence reconciliation. We end with some critical reflections about shortcomings of the current state of research. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

The authors argue that the consideration and direct measurement of intergroup contact is essential for fully comprehending the consequences of rising ethno-cultural diversity in Western democracies. Our results show that neighbourhood immigration-related diversity in itself does not exert the same negative effects on generalized and outgroup trust as found in the North American context. Instead, intergroup contact moderates the effects of neighbourhood diversity. The results add to our understanding of the different socio-political consequences of immigration-related diversity and immigrant contact in social networks. © 2013 Copyright Elections, Public Opinion & Parties.","","","","","","","","","Alesina A., La Ferrara E., Who trusts others?, Journal of Public Economics, 85, 2, pp. 207-234, (2002); Banting K., Johnston R., Soroka S., Immigration and redistribution in the global era, Globalization and Social Redistribution, pp. 261-288, (2006); Banting K., Johnston R., Kymlicka W., Soroka S., Do multiculturalism policies erode the welfare state?

One correlational and three experimental studies in three conflict areas (Northern Ireland, Arizona's border area, and Cyprus; Ns=405, 83, 76, and 91) tested the moderation of these valence-salience effects by individuals' histories of outgroup contact. Consistent with a perceived fit principle valence-salience effects of face-to-face, television-mediated, and imagined contact held among individuals with negative or limited histories of outgroup contact; these effects were significantly reduced or nonsignificant among individuals with positive or extensive past outgroup contact. These moderation effects suggest that positive and diverse intergroup contact in the past buffers against the harmful effects of negative contact experiences in the present, thus limiting the potential for negative spiralling of intergroup relations. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","","Australian Research Council;

We tested the association between two measures of intergroup contact (outgroup friendship and generic contact) and both intergroup forgiveness and prejudice among people who varied in their personal experience of conflict, while simultaneously considering the role of ingroup identification as an inhibitor of forgiveness, and accounting for relevant demographic variables. Contact was positively associated with forgiveness, marginally more so in the case of friendship than general outgroup contact, whereas both conflict experience and identification were negatively associated with forgiveness. While outgroup friendship robustly predicted forgiveness, generic outgroup contact was moderated by conflict experience and ingroup identification. Effects of both forms of contact on prejudice were not moderated. Results are discussed in terms of the greater impact of friendship contact, forgiveness as a more demanding criterion, and the need to pursue research on intergroup forgiveness among large samples of people directly impacted by the events for which forgiveness is relevant. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","cross-group friendships; ingroup identification; intergroup forgiveness; Northern Ireland; prejudice","","","","","","John Templeton Foundation, JTF","We gratefully acknowledge The Templeton Foundation for funding this research; Simon Lolliot for helpful comments on the research; and two anonymous reviewers who gave us most insightful comments on our original submission of this paper.

In this article, we draw attention to what is arguably a more worrying possibility: that pharmaceuticals currently in widespread therapeutic use are already having unintended effects on these processes, and thus on moral decision making and morally significant behavior. We review current evidence on the moral effects of three widely used drugs or drug types: (i) propranolol, (ii) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and (iii) drugs that effect oxytocin physiology. This evidence suggests that the alterations to moral decision making and behavior caused by these agents may have important and difficult-to-evaluate consequences, at least at the population level. We argue that the moral effects of these and other widely used pharmaceuticals warrant further empirical research and ethical analysis. © 2015 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.","Moral decision making; Moral enhancement; Moral judgment; Moral psychology; Oxytocin; Propranolol; Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors","","","","","","","","Amodio D.M., Individual differences in the activation and control of affective race bias as assessed by startle eyeblink response and self-report, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, pp. 738-753, (2003); Bagdy G., Kalogeras K.T., Stimulation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptors induce oxytocin release in the male rat, .

Further, it has been revealed that contact exerts its effects on prejudice reduction mostly by inducing positive affective processes. The present study (N = 146) investigated whether stereotype content enhancement along the core dimensions of competence, sociability, and morality might represent a basic cognitive mechanism driving the contact effects. Results showed that face-to-face encounters with immigrants increased their perceived competence, sociability, and morality. However, only increased perceived outgroup morality mediated the effect of contact on outgroup responses. Our findings extend prior research on the mediators of intergroup contact, showing the key role of perceived morality in driving the contact effects. The importance of these findings for improving intergroup relations is discussed. © The Author(s) 2013.","competence; intergroup contact; morality; stereotype content; warmth","","","","","","","","Abele A.E., Cuddy A.J.C., Judd C.M., Yzerbyt V., Fundamental dimensions of social judgment, European Journal of Social Psychology, 38, pp. 1063-1065, (2008); Alexander R.D., The Biology of Moral Systems, (1987); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Rallying around the flag"": Can an intergroup contact intervention promote national unity?, British Journal of Social Psychology, 51, pp. 239-256, (2012); Ames D.L., Fiske S.T., Todorov A.T., The Handbook of Social Neuroscience, pp. 419-433, (2011); Becker J.C., Asbrock F., What triggers helping versus harming of ambivalent groups?

This research further examined the rarely studied secondary transfer effect (STE; Pettigrew, 2009), by which contact with a primary outgroup reduces prejudice toward secondary groups that are not directly involved in the contact. Across 3 cross-sectional studies conducted in Cyprus (N = 1,653), Northern Ireland (N = 1,973), and Texas (N = 275) and 1 longitudinal study conducted in Northern Ireland (N = 411), the present research sought to systematically rule out alternative accounts of the STE and to investigate 2 potential mediating mechanisms (ingroup reappraisal and attitude generalization). Results indicated that, consistent with the STE, contact with a primary outgroup predicts attitudes toward secondary outgroups, over and above contact with the secondary outgroup, socially desirable responding, and prior attitudes. Mediation analyses found strong evidence for attitude generalization but only limited evidence for ingroup reappraisal as an underlying process. Two out of 3 tests of a reverse model, where contact with the secondary outgroup predicts attitudes toward the primary outgroup, provide further evidence for an indirect effect through attitude generalization. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, and directions for future research are identified. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","Attitude generalization; Ingroup reappraisal; Intergroup contact; Prejudice reduction; Secondary transfer effect","","","","","","","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, (1991); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Amir Y., Contact hypothesis and ethnic relations, Psychological Bulletin, 71, pp. 319-342, (1969); Amir Y., The role of intergroup contact in change of prejudice and intergroup relations, Toward the elimination of racism, pp. 245-280, (1976); Appiah K.A., Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a world of strangers, (2006); Ashmore R.D., Deaux K., McLaughlin-Volpe T., An organizing framework for collective identity: Articulation and significance of multidimensionality, Psychological Review, 130, pp. 80-114, (2004); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Race hate on rise in Northern Ireland, (2004); Binder J., Zagefka H., Brown R., Funke F., Kessler T., Mummendey A., Leyens J.-P., Does contact reduce prejudice or does prejudice reduce contact?

At the psychological level, increasing proximity to, and therefore salience of, social ‘outgroups’ has been associated with numerous negative psychological effects (e.g. intergroup anxiety, see Stephan and Stephan 1985; ingroup favouritism, see Mullen et al. 1992; prejudice, see Allport 1954). Concomitant to this, however, diversity provides opportunities for resolution of conflict through contact between opposing groups; contact which, under the right circumstances, can have a significant and lasting positive effect on intergroup relations. Since its formulation by Gordon Allport (1954), the ‘contact hypothesis’ has embodied this potential positive effect in the field of social psychology, and has produced a significant body of research into its conditions, processes, and outcomes. This chapter will outline the progression of intergroup contact research over the last 50-60 years, provide a summary of the current state of the field, and discuss some of the recent criticisms levelled against contact theory. It will conclude that, despite the challenges to its claims and principles, the position of contact as an evidentially sound and integrated theory of intergroup relations renders it an invaluable tool in the study of diversity. © 2015 selection and editorial material, Steven Vertovec.","","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Anderson L.S., Outdoor Adventure Recreation and Social Integration: A Social Psychological Perspective, (1995); Barlow F.K., Paolini S., Pedersen A., Hornsey M.J., Radke H.R., Harwood J., Rubin M., Sibley C.G., The Contact Caveat: Negative Contact Predicts Increased Prejudice More Than Positive Contact Predicts Reduced Prejudice, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 38, 12, pp. 1629-1643, (2012); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research: Conceptual, Strategic, and Statistical Considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 6, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Blascovich J., Mendes W.B., Hunter S.B., Lickel B., Kowai-Bell N., Perceiver Threat in Social Interactions with Stigmatized Others, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80, 2, pp. 253-267, (2001); Bornman E., Mynhardt J.C., Social Identity and Intergroup Contact in South Africa with Specific Reference to the Work Situation, Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs, 117, 4, pp. 439-462, (1991); Brewer M.B., Miller N., Beyond the Contact Hypothesis: Theoretical Perspectives on Desegregation, Groups in Contact: The Psychology of Desegregation, (1984); Brown R., Hewstone M., An Integrative Theory of Intergroup Contact, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 37, pp. 255-343, (2005); Christ O., Ulrich J., Wagner U., The Joint Effects of Positive and Negative Intergroup Contact on Attitudes and Attitude Strength, (2008); Christ O., Hewstone M., Tausch N., Wagner U., Voci A., Hughes J., Cairns E., Direct Contact as a Moderator of Extended Contact Effects: Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Impact on Outgroup Attitudes, Behavioral Intentions, and Attitude Certainty, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 36, 12, pp. 1662-1674, (2010); Cook S.W., Interpersonal and Attitudinal Outcomes in Cooperating Interracial Groups, Journal of Research and Development in Education, 12, 1, pp. 97-113, (1978); Davies K., Tropp L.R., Aron A., Pettigrew T.F., Wright S.C., Cross-group Friendships and Intergroup Attitudes: A Meta-analytic Review, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 15, 4, pp. 332-351, (2011); Dixon J., Durrheim K., Tredoux C., Beyond the Optimal Contact Strategy: A Reality Check for the Contact Hypothesis, American Psychologist, 60, 7, pp. 697-711, (2005); Dixon J., Durrheim K., Tredoux C., Tropp L., Clack B., Eaton L., A Paradox of Integration?

Study 1, using data based on a cross-section of the general population of eight European countries (France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and the UK; N=7,042), examined this hypothesis in the context of aggressive action tendencies towards immigrants. Study 2, using longitudinal data obtained from a general population sample in Northern Ireland, considered effects on aggressive action tendencies between ethno-religious groups in conflict. Both studies confirmed our predictions, showing that while perceived threat was associated with greater intergroup aggressive tendencies, positive intergroup contact was indirectly associated with reduced aggressive action tendencies, via reduced intergroup threat. Findings are discussed in terms of the theoretical contributions of this research for understanding the relationship between intergroup contact and intergroup aggression. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Aggressive action tendencies; Intergroup conflict; Intergroup contact; Longitudinal data; Perceived intergroup threat","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aggression; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Conflict; Europe; Female; France; Germany; Great Britain; Group Processes; Humans; Hungary; Interpersonal Relations; Italy; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Northern Ireland; Poland; Portugal; Social Behavior; Xenophobia; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; aggression; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; ethnic conflict; ethnology; Europe; female; France; Germany; group process; human; human relation; Hungary; Italy; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; migration; Netherlands; Poland; Portugal; psychology; social behavior; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; very elderly; xenophobia; young adult","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Anderson C.A., Bushman B.J., Human aggression, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51, (2002); Barlow F.K., Paolini S., Pedersen A., Hornsey M.J., Radke H.R.M., Harwood J., Rubin M., Sibley C.G., The contact caveat.

We review the vast literature on the effectiveness of intergroup contact and discuss when and how it reduces prejudice. We also discuss key features of successful interventions, highlighting examples from conflict zones around the world. Rather than accepting, as some scholars do, that conflict is inevitable, we argue that intergroup contact, in its various forms, can play a pivotal and preemptive role in conflict prevention. We suggest that a blunt application of contact theory, particularly when groups are of unequal status, can have some unfortunate consequences, and contact interventions can, and should, be designed to overcome these pitfalls.

Emotionalmechanisms are thought to be involved inmediating implicit ""outgroup"" bias but there is little evidence concerning the underlying neurobiology. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of noradrenergic mechanisms in the generation of implicit racial attitudes. Methods Healthy volunteers (n036) of white ethnic origin, received a single oral dose of the β-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (40 mg), in a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, design. Participants completed an explicitmeasure of prejudice and the racial implicit association test (IAT), 1-2 h after propranolol administration. Results Relative to placebo, propranolol significantly lowered heart rate and abolished implicit racial bias, without affecting the measure of explicit racial prejudice. Propranolol did not affect subjective mood. Conclusions Our results indicate that β-adrenoceptors play a role in the expression of implicit racial attitudes suggesting that noradrenaline-related emotional mechanisms may mediate negative racial bias. Our findings may also have practical importance given that propranolol is a widely used drug. However, further studies will be needed to examine whether a similar effect can be demonstrated in the course of clinical treatment. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Explicit prejudice; Implicit racial bias; Noradrenaline; Propranolol","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Double-Blind Method; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Prejudice; Propranolol; Social Behavior; placebo; propranolol; adult; article; clinical trial; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug activity; emotionality; ethnicity; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; male; neurobiology; noradrenergic system; normal human; priority journal; racism; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; social attitude; social behavior; social psychology","","propranolol, 13013-17-7, 318-98-9, 3506-09-0, 4199-09-1, 525-66-6; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists, ; Propranolol, 525-66-6","","","Wellcome Trust, WT, (WT086041MA, WT087208MF); Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC, (AH/F019513/1)","Acknowledgments We are grateful to the Wellcome Trust for funding part of this research (WT087208MF and WT086041MA).","Amodio D.M., Individual differences in the activation and control of affective race bias as assessed by startle eyeblink response and self-report, J Pers Soc Psychol, 84, pp. 738-753, (2003); Beck A.T., Ward C.H., Mendelson M., Mock J., Erbaugh J., An inventory for measuring depression, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 4, pp. 561-571, (1961); Cahill L., Prins B., Wber M., McGaugh J.L., Beta-adrenergic activation and emotional memory for events, Nature, 371, pp. 702-204, (1994); Chamberlain S.R., Mueller U., Blackwell A.D., Robbins T.W., Shakian B.J., Noradrenergic modulation of working memory and emotional memory in humans, Psychopharmacology, 188, pp. 397-407, (2006); Converse J.M., Presser S., Survey Questions, Handcrafting the Standardized Questionnaire, Series: Quantitative Applications in the Social Science 63., (1986); De Dreu C.K.W., Greer L., Gerben L., Van Kleef A., Shalvi S., Handgraaf M.J.J., Oxytocin promotes human ethnocentrism, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 108, pp. 1262-1266, (2011); Eysenck H.J., Eysenck S.B.G., Manual of the Eysenck Personal Inventory., (1964); Fazio R.H., Jackson J.R., Dunton B.C., Williams C.J., Variability in automatic activation as an unobtrusive measure of racial attitudes: A bona fide pipeline?, J Pers Soc Psychol, 69, pp. 1013-1027, (1995); Gilman G., The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, (1996); Greenwald A.G., McGhee D.E., Schwartz J.L.K., Measuring individuals differences in implicit cognition: The implicit association test, J Per Soc Psychol, 74, pp. 1464-1480, (1998); Greenwald A.G., Banaji M.R., Nosek B.A., Understanding and using the implicit association test: I.

Results demonstrated that extended contact effects varied as a function of the relationship to ingroup contacts, and that extended contact interacted with closeness ratings in predicting outgroup trust. Consistent with hypotheses, extended contacts via more intimate ingroup relationships (i.e., friends and family) were overall more strongly related to outgroup trust than extended contacts via less intimate ingroup relations (i.e., neighbors and work colleagues). Moreover, within each level of intimacy extended contact was related to outgroup trust only at high, and not at low, levels of rated closeness to ingroup contacts. The theoretical contributions, limitations and practical implications of these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2011.","closeness; extended contact; Inclusion of the Other in the Self; Northern Ireland; outgroup trust","","","","","","","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interaction, (1991); Aron A., Aron E.N., Love as the Expansion of Self: Understanding Attraction and Satisfaction, (1986); Aron A., Aron E.N., Smollan D., Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612, (1992); Aron A., Aron E.N., Tudor M., Nelson G., Close relationships as including the other in the self, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 57, pp. 792-807, (1991); Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe T., Mashek D., Lewandowski G., Wright S.C., Aron E.N., Including others in the self, European Review of Social Psychology, 15, pp. 101-132, (2004); Ashmore R.D., Deaux K., McLaughlin-Volpe T., An organizing framework for collective identity: Articulation and significance of multidimensionality, Psychological Review, 130, pp. 80-114, (2004); Berscheid E., Snyder M., Omoto A.M., The Relationship Closeness Inventory: Assessing the closeness of interpersonal relationships, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612, (1989); Cairns E., Darby J., The conflict in Northern Ireland: Causes, consequences and controls, American Psychologist, 53, pp. 757-760, (1998); Cairns E., van Til J., Williamson A., Social capital, collectivism-individualism and community background in Northern Ireland, A Report to the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the Voluntary and Community Unit of the Department for Social Development, (2003); Cameron L., Rutland A., Extended contact through story reading in school: Reducing children's prejudice towards the disabled, Journal of Social Issues, 62, pp. 469-488, (2006); Cameron L., Rutland A., Brown R., Douch R., Changing children's intergroup attitudes toward refugees: Testing different models of extended contact, Child Development, 77, pp. 1208-1219, (2006); Christ O., Hewstone M., Tausch N., Wagner U., Voci A., Hughes J., Cairns E., Direct contact as a moderator of extended contact effects: Cross-sectional and longitudinal impact on outgroup attitudes, behavioral intentions, and attitude certainty, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 36, pp. 1662-1674, (2010); Clark M.S., Reis H.T., Interpersonal processes in close relationships, Annual Review of Psychology, 39, pp. 609-672, (1988); Cohen J., A power primer, Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159, (1992); de Tezanos-Pinto P., Bratt C., Brown R., What will the others think?

In the present paper we test this claim by investigating the impact of neighbourhood diversity and self-reported intergroup contact on orientations (outgroup attitudes and social distance) toward one religious outgroup: Muslims. Respondents were both White British majority (N=867) and non-Muslim ethnic minority (N=567) residents of neighbourhoods in England which varied in their proportion of ethnic minority residents. We tested both direct and indirect (via intergroup contact) effects of diversity on outgroup orientations toward Muslims. Results show that individuals living in more ethnically diverse areas-regardless of whether they are White British members of the majority or non-Muslim members of ethnic minorities-have more positive contact with Muslims, with positive consequences for intergroup relations with Muslims. © 2014 The Political Quarterly Publishing Co.

Study 1 (N= 488 Black South African students) tested whether social identity would positively, whereas intergroup contact would negatively predict collective action and support for policies benefiting the ingroup. Study 2 (N= 244 White South African students) predicted whether social identity would positively predict collective action benefiting the ingroup, and intergroup contact would positively predict support for policies to benefit the Black outgroup. Both studies yielded evidence in support of the predictive power of social identity and contact on collective action and policy support. Additionally, Study 1 confirmed that intergroup contact moderated the effects of social identity on relative deprivation, and relative deprivation on collective action. Overall findings support an integration of SIMCA and intergroup contact theory, and provide a fuller understanding of the social psychological processes leading to collective action. © 2011 The British Psychological Society.","","Adolescent; African Continental Ancestry Group; Cooperative Behavior; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Models, Psychological; Policy; Social Identification; South Africa; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; article; Caucasian; cooperation; female; human; human relation; male; Negro; policy; psychological aspect; psychological model; social behavior; South Africa","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modelling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423, (1988); Bandura A., Exercise of personal and collective efficacy in changing societies, Self-efficacy in changing societies, pp. 1-45, (1995); Bandura A., Exercise of human agency through collective efficacy, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 9, pp. 75-78, (2000); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 6, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Barrett P., Structural equation modelling: Adjudging model fit, Personality and Individual Differences, 42, pp. 815-824, (2007); Brewer M., Deprovincialization: Social identity complexity and out-group acceptance, Emerging research directions for improving intergroup relations: Building on the legacy of Thomas F.

Two studies investigated whether self-reports are resistant to the effects of context. Study 1 required participants to recall a positive or negative encounter with an outgroup member, either immediately prior to, or following, self-reports of attitudes and contact with the outgroup. Recalling an outgroup encounter immediately prior to reporting attitudes affected reported attitudes in accordance with the valence of the encounter, while reported contact was unaffected. Study 2 provided primed participants with a newspaper story involving a positive vs. negative intergroup encounter. When compared to a control condition in which group membership of the story's characters was unknown, attitudes were affected in accordance with the valence of the prime, while self-reports of contact were not. Overall, these findings show, for the first time, that self-reports of contact are resistant to at least some types of context effects, and increase the confidence with which conclusions can be drawn from research relying on such self-report measures of intergroup contact. © 2010 Cises.","Context effects; Priming; Validity of self-reports","","","","","","","","Allport G., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Dicken C., Good impression, social desirability, and acquiescence as suppressor variables, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 23, pp. 699-720, (1963); Haddock G., Rothman A.J., Reber R., Schwarz N., Experiences forming judgments of attitude certainty, intensity, and importance: The role of subjective experiences, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, pp. 771-782, (1999); Hewstone M., Sharp M.S., Judd C.M., Validating self-reports of intergroup contact using observer ratings: A round-robin analysis, Manuscript under Review, (2010); Higgins E., Brendl C.M., Accessibility and applicability: Some ""activation rules"" influencing judgment, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 31, pp. 218-243, (1995); Konstabel K., The structure and validity of self- and peer-reported personality traits, Doctoral Dissertation, (2006); Lentz T.F., Acquiescence as a factor in the measurement of personality, Psychological Bulletin, 35, (1938); Mussweiler T., Englich B., Subliminal anchoring: Judgmental consequences and underlying mechanisms, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 98, 2, pp. 133-143, (2005); Paulhus D.L., Measurement and control of response bias, Measures of Personality and Social Psychological Attitudes, pp. 17-59, (1991); Pettigrew T.F., Tropp L.R., A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 90, 5, pp. 751-783, (2006); Salancik G.R., Conway M., Attitude inferences from salient and relevant cognitive content about behavior, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 32, pp. 829-840, (1975); Schwarz N., Self-reports: How the questions shape the answers, American Psychologist, 54, pp. 93-105, (1999); Schwarz N., Bless H., Constructing reality and its alternatives: Assimilation and contrast effects in social judgment, The Construction of Social Judgments, pp. 217-245, (1992); Schwarz N., Strack F., Thinking about your life: Healthy lessons from social cognition, The Scope of Social Psychology: Theory and Applications, pp. 121-136, (2007); Schwarz N., Sudman S., Context Effects in Social and Psychological Research, (1992); Schwarz N., Bless H., Strack F., Klumpp G., Rittenauer-Schatka H., Simons A., Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61, pp. 195-202, (1991); Strack F., Schwarz N., Gschneidinger E., Happiness and reminiscing: The role of time perspective, affect, and mode of thinking, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 49, pp. 1460-1469, (1985); Tellegen A., The analysis of consistency in personality assessment, Journal of Personality, 56, pp. 621-663, (1988); Turner R.N., Hewstone M., Voci A., Paolini S., Christ O., Reducing prejudice via direct and extended cross-group friendship, European Review of Social Psychology, 18, pp. 212-255, (2008); Wojciszke B., Multiple meanings of behavior: Construing actions in terms of competence or morality, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, pp. 222-232, (1994); Wojciszke B., Morality and competence in person- and self-perception, European Review of Social Psychology, 16, pp. 155-188, (2005); Wright S.C., Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe T., Ropp S.A., The extended contact effect: Knowledge of cross-group friendships and prejudice, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, pp. 73-90, (1997)","M.

We examined the hypothesis that being affiliated with a religion may buffer individuals against this negative impact of mortality salience. Two studies, conducted in two cultures that differ in their emphasis on religiosity (the United Kingdom and Italy), supported this hypothesis. Specifically, we found that mortality salience resulted in more negative out-group attitudes only among participants not affiliated with any religion. Further, this buffering effect of religious affiliation was not moderated by participants' specific religious orientations or by their levels of social dominance orientation. In addition, the buffering effect did not hold when prejudice against the target out-group was not proscribed by religious authorities. Implications for research on religion, prejudice, and terror management are discussed. © 2016 Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.","Mortality salience; Out-group attitudes; Prejudice; Religious affiliation;

This article reports meta-analytic reviews of over 30 years of experimental, lab-based research on individual-to-group generalisation (107 independent tests; 5393 participants). In a first meta-analysis, a positive, medium-size generalisation effect was detected (r =.28, p <.001), reflecting significant generalisation of outgroup exemplar information to the outgroup judgment. This effect was moderated by the number of exemplars and exemplar typicality, with more moderately atypical exemplars maximising generalisation effects. Several other design parameters—including type of control condition, generalisation measures, mode of information provision, type of target outgroup and origin of study—did not moderate the positive generalisation effect. A second meta-analysis investigated the interplay between metacognitions and generalisation and found assimilation effects with metacognitive triggers encouraging exemplar inclusion, and contrast effects with metacognitive cues encouraging exemplar exclusion. These results demonstrate that the same outgroup exemplar can lead to bias reduction or bias exacerbation, depending on available meta-cognitive cues. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for intergroup psychology, generalisation theory and bias reduction interventions. © 2016 European Association of Social Psychology.","individual-to-group generalisation; intergroup contact; meta-cognition; prejudice; social cognition; Stereotyping","","","","","","Centre for Translational Neuroscience and Mental Health; Leverhulme Trust","This work was supported by the Centre for Translational Neuroscience and Mental Health; Leverhulme Trust.","Allen T.J., Sherman J.W., Conrey F.R., Stroessner S.J., Stereotype strength and attentional bias: Preference for confirming versus disconfirming information depends on processing capacity, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45, pp. 1081-1087, (2009); Ames D., Inside the mind reader’s tool kit: Projection and stereotyping in mental state inference, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, pp. 340-353, (2004); Amichai-Hamburger Y., McKenna K., The contact hypothesis reconsidered: Interacting via the Internet, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11, pp. 825-843, (2006); Ashmore R.D., Del Boca F.K., Conceptual approaches to stereotypes and stereotyping, Cognitive processes stereotyping and intergroup behaviour, (1981); Augoustinos M., Walker I., Donaghue N., Social cognition: An integrated introduction, (2006); Barlow F.K., Paolini S., Pedersen A., Hornsey M.J., Radke H.R., Harwood J., Sibley C.G., The contact caveat negative contact predicts increased prejudice more than positive contact predicts reduced prejudice, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 38, pp. 1629-1643, (2012); Batson C.D., Polycarpou P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Mitchener E.C., Bednar L.L., Highberger L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feelings for a member of a stigmatised group improve feelings toward the group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 105-118, (1997); Bekhuis H., Ruiter S., Coenders M., Xenophobia among youngsters: The effect of interethnic contact, European Sociological Review, 29, pp. 229-242, (2013); Bettencourt A.B., Charlton K., Dorr N., Hume D.L., Status differences and in-group bias: A meta-analytic examination of the effects of status stability, status legitimacy, and group permeability, Psychological Bulletin, 127, pp. 520-542, (2001); Bless H., Schwarz N., Context effects in political judgement: Assimilation and contrast as a function of categorization processes, European Journal of Social Psychology, 28, pp. 159-172, (1998); Bless H., Schwarz N., Mental construal and the emergence of assimilation and contrast effects: The inclusion/exclusion model, Advances in experimental social psychology, 42, pp. 319-373, (2010); Bless H., Schwarz N., Bodenhausen G., Thiel L., Personalised versus generalised benefits of stereotype disconfirmation: Trade-offs in the evaluation of atypical exemplars and their social groups, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 37, pp. 386-397, (2001); Bless H., Wanke M., Can the same information be typical and atypical?

We chart the progress that has been made in understanding two distinct forms of contact: direct and indirect. We highlight the progress made in understanding the effects of each type of contact, as well as both moderating and mediating factors, and emphasize the multiple impacts of direct contact, especially. We then consider some of the main critiques of inter-group contact, focusing on empirical issues and whether contact impedes social change, and provide a research agenda for the coming years. We conclude that this body of work no longer merits the modest title of 'hypothesis', but fully deserves acknowledgement as an integrated and influential theory. ©2011 The British Psychological Society.","","Empirical Research; Group Processes; Hostility; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Prejudice; Psychological Theory; Social Change; Social Perception; article; empirical research; group process; hostility; human; human relation; perception; psychological theory; social change; social psychology","","","","","","","Aberson C.L., Haag S.C., Contact, perspective taking, and anxiety as predictors of stereotype endorsement, explicit attitudes, and implicit attitudes, Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 10, pp. 179-201, (2007); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Rallying around the flag"": Can an intergroup contact intervention promote national unity?, British Journal of Social Psychology, (2011); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Intergroup difference and harmony: The role of intergroup contact, Progress in Asian social psychology; Alexander L., Tredoux C., The spaces between us: A spatial analysis of informal segregation at a South African university, Journal of Social Issues, 66, pp. 367-386, (2010); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Barlow F.K., Louis W.R., Hewstone M., Rejected!

In Study 1 we found an outgroup homogeneity (OH) effect for female nurses in the majority, but an ingroup homogeneity (IH) effect for a token minority of male nurses. In Study 2 we found similar effects in a different setting - an OH effect for policemen in the majority and an IH effect for policewomen in the minority. Although measures of visibility, status, and, especially, familiarity tended to show the same pattern as perceived variability, there was no evidence that they mediated perceived dispersion. Results are discussed in terms of group size, rather than gender, being moderators of perceived variability, and with reference to Kanter's (1977a, 1977b) theory of group proportions. © 2011 Hogrefe Publishing.","Ingroup homogeneity; Outgroup homogeneity; Perceived group variability","","","","","","","","Allmendinger J., Hackman J.R., The More, the Better?

We found evidence of a strong relationship between post-intervention contact and post-intervention outgroup evaluations in all groups and evidence of indirect effects of post-intervention contact on outgroup evaluations by symbolic threat for the minority groups rating the majority group. We found that in the context of institutional inequalities, integrated threat theory may not be sufficiently complex to uncover the processes that underlie the contact–attitude link for majority groups rating minority groups. Further, we found indirect effects of post-intervention contact on outgroup evaluations via realistic threat for interminority group ratings. Thus, we elucidate some of the different mechanisms that underlie the intergroup perceptions of majority and minority group members. © The Author(s) 2013.","group status; integrated threat theory; intergroup contact; intervention","","","","","","","","Ali S.H., Ethnic Relations in Malaysia: Harmony and Conflict, (2008); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Ramiah A.A., (2009); Ramiah A.A., Hewstone M., ‘Rallying Around the Flag’: Can an Intergroup Contact Intervention Promote National Unity?, British Journal of Social Psychology, 51, pp. 239-256, (2011); Ramiah A.A., Ramasamy T., Economic Development Strategies and Averting Collective Violence, (2013); Bauer D.J., Preacher K.J., Gil K.M., Conceptualizing and Testing Random Indirect Effects and Moderated Mediation in Multilevel Models: New Procedures and Recommendations, Psychological Methods, 11, pp. 142-163, (2006); Batson D.C., Polycarpou M.P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Mitchener E.C., Bednar L.L., Klein T.R., Highberger L., Empathy and Attitudes: Can Feeling for a Member of a Stigmatized Group Improve Feelings toward the Group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 105-118, (1997); Binder J., Zagefka H., Brown R., Funke F., Kessler T., Mummendey A., Maquil A., Demoulin S., Leyens J.-P., Does Contact Reduce Prejudice or does Prejudice Reduce Contact?

Crossgroup friendships were negatively associated with negative action tendencies, and positively associated with positive outgroup attitudes and greater perceived outgroup variability for both samples, irrespective of the target group. The importance of intergroup anxiety and affective empathy as mediators of these effects was also confirmed. Multigroup comparisons showed significant differences in the structural models across the two samples in both studies, and confirmed prior findings in the contact literature that contact effects are stronger for majority than minority groups. These findings are the first of their kind within the South African context. © 2010 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.","","South Africa; cultural relations; group behavior; minority group; social characteristics; social status; student","","","","","","","Alexander L., Tredoux C., The spaces between us: A spatial analysis of informal segregation at a South African university campus, Journal of Social Issues, 66, pp. 369-388, (2010); Allport G., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Amir Y., Contact hypothesis in ethnic relations, Psychological Bulletin, 71, pp. 319-342, (1969); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423, (1988); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Batson C.D., Polycarpou M.P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Mitchener E.C., Bednar L.L., Highberger L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings toward the group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 105-118, (1997); Batson C.D., Turk C.L., Shaw L.L., Klein T.R., Information function of empathic emotion: Learning that we value the other's welfare, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 68, pp. 1042-1054, (1995); Brown R., Hewstone M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in experimental social psychology, 37, pp. 255-343, (2005); Byrne B.M., Shavelson R.J., Muthen B., Testing for the equivalence of factor covariance and mean structures: The issue of partial measurement invariance, Psychological Bulletin, 105, pp. 456-466, (1989); Davis M.H., Empathy: A social psychological approach, (1994); Dixon J., Durrheim K., Contact and the ecology of racial division: Some varieties of informal segregation, British Journal of Social Psychology, 42, pp. 1-23, (2003); Dixon J., Durrheim K., Tredoux C., Tropp L., Clack B., Eaton E., A paradox of integration?

The study assessed how post-test measures of quality of intergroup contact, outgroup evaluations, and levels of identification changed compared to their respective pre-test levels, for both National Service and control group participants. The intervention did not lead to a worsening of any of the constructs related to intergroup relations, which is noteworthy given the novelty for many participants of mixing in a multi-ethnic setting. Furthermore, all rater groups (Malays, Chinese, and Indians) maintained their ethnic identity, even in the presence of high levels of national identity, which we discuss with respect to past research on the effects of positive intergroup contact on minority group identification. However, the changes associated with the intervention yielded only small effect sizes, and, on the whole, National Service participants did not show significantly greater improvement than that experienced by control participants. We discuss the value of intergroup contact in this novel setting, considering various features of this programme that may have limited its effectiveness and discuss how such interventions can more successfully meet their goals. © 2012 The British Psychological Society.","","Case-Control Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Malaysia; Male; Sample Size; Self Concept; Social Identification; Young Adult; adult; article; case control study; ethnic group; ethnology; female; group process; human; human relation; longitudinal study; Malaysia; male; psychological aspect; sample size; self concept; social behavior","","","","","","","Al Ramiah A., Intergroup relations in Malaysia: Identity, contact, and threat, (2009); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Little T., Lang K.M., (2011); Al Ramiah A., Ramasamy T., Exploring the relationship between development and conflict - The Malaysian experience, Economic development strategies and averting collective violence; Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Amir Y., Bizman A., Benari R., Rivner M., Contact between Israelis and Arabs - A theoretical evaluation of effects, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 11, pp. 426-443, (1980); Aronson E., Mills J., The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group, Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 59, pp. 177-181, (1959); Bernal M.E., Knight G.P., Garza C.A., Ocampo K.A., Cota M.K., The development of ethnic identity in Mexican-American children, Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences, 12, pp. 3-24, (1990); Berry J.W., Kim U., Power S., Young M., Bujaki M., Acculturation attitudes in plural societies, Applied Psychology, 38, pp. 185-206, (1989); Briggs S.R., Cheek J.M., The role of factor analysis in the development and evaluation of personality scales, Journal of Personality, 54, pp. 106-148, (1986); Brown R., Social Identity Theory: Past achievements, current problems and future challenges, European Journal of Social Psychology, 30, pp. 745-778, (2000); Brown R., Hewstone M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 37, pp. 255-343, (2005); Cairns E., Hewstone M., Northern Ireland: The impact of peacemaking in Northern Ireland on intergroup behavior, Peace education: The concept, principles and practices around the world, pp. 217-228, (2002); Campbell D.T., Stanley J.C., Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for research, Handbook of research on teaching, pp. 171-246, (1963); (2006); Clark K.B., Clark M.P., Emotional factors in racial identification and preference in Negro children, Journal of Negro Education, 19, pp. 341-350, (1950); Cohen J., A power primer, Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159, (1992); Cohen J., Cohen P., (2nd edition).

This Special Issue complements that body of work by demonstrating the effects of various forms of indirect contact on intergroup attitudes and relations. Indirect contact includes (a) extended contact: learning that an ingroup member is friends with an outgroup member, (b) vicarious contact: observing an ingroup member interact with an outgroup member, and (c) imagined contact: imagining oneself interacting with an outgroup member. The effects of indirect contact not only occur independently of direct contact, they often involve distinct psychological mechanisms. The present article briefly reviews work on direct intergroup contact and then discusses recent theoretical and empirical developments in the study of extended contact, vicarious contact, and imagined contact. We consider the similarities and distinctions in the dynamics of these forms of indirect contact and conclude by identifying promising directions for future research. © The Author(s) 2011.","bias; contact theory; extended contact; imagined contact; intergroup contact; intergroup relations; prejudice reduction; vicarious contact","","","","","","","","Abrams D., Crisp R.J., Marques S., Fagg E., Bedford L., Provias D., Threat inoculation: Experienced and imagined intergenerational contact prevent stereotype threat effects on older people's math performance, Psychology and Aging, 23, pp. 934-939, (2008); Abrams D., Eller A., Bryant J., An age apart: The effects of intergenerational contact and stereotype threat on performance and intergroup bias, Psychology and Aging, 21, pp. 691-702, (2006); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Altemeyer R., The other 'authoritarian personality, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 30, pp. 47-91, (1998); Aron A., Aron E.N., Tudor M., Nelson G., Close relationships as including the other in the self, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, pp. 241-253, (1991); Bandura A., Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, (1986); Binder J., Zagefka H., Brown R., Funke F., Kessler T., Mummendey A., Leyens J.-P., Does contact reduce prejudice or does prejudice reduce contact?

Study 1 examined the impact of three factors - the extension of trust or distrust, a social climate of threat or reduced threat, and high/low group identification - on perceived risk and group-level emotion. Study 2 examined the impact of these factors on expected negative intergroup relations and symbolic and realistic outcomes. Results from both studies demonstrated that: (1) evaluation of a community leader's extension of trust or distrust toward the outgroup under threat/reduced threat was moderated by group identification, and (2) the leader's extension of distrust toward the outgroup elicited greater anger and less positive emotion, and was seen as more damaging to intergroup relations than was the extension of trust. © 2013 Cises.","Ingroup identification;

An emergent trend in modern psychology has focused on understanding how cognition is linked to neural function, leading researchers to investigate the neural correlates of prejudice. Research in this area using racial group memberships has quickly highlighted the amygdala as a neural structure of importance. In this article, we offer a critical review of social neuroscientific studies of the amygdala in race-related prejudice. Rather than the dominant interpretation that amygdala activity reflects a racial or outgroup bias per se, we argue that the observed pattern of sensitivity in this literature is best considered in terms of potential threat. More specifically, we argue that negative culturally-learned associations between black males and potential threat better explain the observed pattern of amygdala activity. Finally, we consider future directions for the field and offer specific experiments and predictions to directly address unanswered questions. © 2014 Chekroud, Everett, Bridge and Hewstone.","Amygdala; Implicit bias; Neuroimaging; Prejudice; Social neuroscience; Threat","amygdaloid nucleus; article; BOLD signal; cognition; emotion; functional magnetic resonance imaging; high resolution computer tomography; human; image processing; neuroimaging; prediction; race; racism; subthalamus; temporal lobe; threat","","","","","Medical Research Council, MRC, (G0802171)","","Adolphs R., Gosselin F., Buchanan T.W., Tranel D., Schyns P., Damasio A.R., A mechanism for impaired fear recognition after amygdala damage, Nature, 433, pp. 68-72, (2005); Adolphs R., Tranel D., Damasio H., Damasio A., Impaired recognition of emotion in facial expressions following bilateral damage to the human amygdala, Nature, 372, pp. 669-672, (1994); Adolphs R., Tranel D., Hamann S., Young A.W., Calder A.J., Phelps E.A., Et al., Recognition of facial emotion in nine individuals with bilateral amygdala damage, Neuropsychologia, 37, pp. 1111-1117, (1999); Allport G., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Amaral D.G., Price J.L., Pitkanen A., Carmichael S.T., Anatomical Organization of the Primate Amygdaloid Complex, pp. 1-66, (1992); Balleine B.W., Killcross S., Parallel incentive processing: An integrated view of amygdala function, Trends Neurosci, 29, pp. 272-279, (2006); Baron-Cohen S., Mindblindness: An Essay On Autism and Theory of Mind, (1995); Bickart K.C., Hollenbeck M.C., Barrett L.F., Dickerson B.C., Intrinsic amygdala-cortical functional connectivity predicts social network size in humans, J.

The basic idea of intergroup contact theory-that contact between groups reduces prejudice-is presented. Research examining this idea from a communication perspective is described and integrated with the large social-psychological body of work. We focus first on direct, face-to-face contact between members of different groups. We then discuss various forms of indirect contact including vicarious, extended, imagined, and computer-mediated forms of contact. Finally, we present an extended research agenda for the field of communication to contribute to what is fundamentally a communicative event. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

With a number of countries either still experiencing or having just emerged from periods of pervasive intergroup animosity, contact theory is, nowadays, being put to its most stringent test as contact theorists try to uncover ways in which intergroup conflict can be reduced and reconciliation fostered. This article draws on research conducted at the Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict in countries including South Africa, Northern Ireland, Cyprus, and Bosnia. We report on our efforts to add to the emerging body of literature by (a) exploring the possible roles that direct and extended contact play in (post-) conflict societies; (b) asking when we might-or might not-expect contact to positively affect more demanding outcomes (such as intergroup trust and forgiveness); and (c) by investigating the processes by which contact achieves these outcomes. We then outline a research program that aims to further study both the benefits and limitations of intergroup contact in societies that are immersed in or emerging from protracted intergroup conflict. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Direct contact; Extended contact; Mediators; Moderators; Prejudice","Bosnia and Herzegovina; Cyprus; Northern Ireland; South Africa; United Kingdom; conflict management; international relations; political conflict; theoretical study","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Rallying around the flag"": Can an intergroup contact intervention promote national unity, British Journal of Social Psychology, 51, pp. 239-256, (2012); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Intergroup contact as a tool for reducing, resolving and preventing intergroup conflict: Evidence, limitations, and potential, American Psychologist, 68, pp. 527-542, (2013); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Little T., Lang K., The influence of status on the relationship between intergroup contact, threat, and prejudice in the context of a nation-building intervention in Malaysia, Journal of Conflict Resolution.

Drawing from research on intergroup contact theory, we argue that positive intergroup contact is able to reduce SDO-levels. The results of an intergroup contact intervention study among high school students (Study 1, N = 71) demonstrated that SDO levels were indeed attenuated after the intervention. Furthermore, this intervention effect on SDO was especially pronounced among students reporting a higher quality of contact. A cross-lagged longitudinal survey among adults (Study 2, N = 363) extended these findings by demonstrating that positive intergroup contact is able to decrease SDO over time. Moreover, we did not obtain evidence for the idea that people high in SDO would engage less in intergroup contact. These findings indicate that intergroup contact erodes one of the important socio-ideological bases of generalized prejudice and discrimination. © The Author(s).","Cross-lagged design; Intergroup contact; Longitudinal; Prejudice; Social dominance orientation","","","","","","Research Foundation – Flanders; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO","This research was supported by a postdoctoral research grant from the Research Foundation – Flanders (FWO, Belgium) awarded to Kristof Dhont.

We used a paired electro-encephalogram paradigm: pairs of participants performed an attention task, followed by feedback indicating monetary loss or gain on every trial. Participants were randomly allocated to the power-holder, subordinate or neutral group by creating different levels of control over how a joint monetary reward would be allocated. We found that power was associated with reduced behavioural accuracy. Event-related potential analysis showed that power-holders devoted less motivational resources to their targets than did subordinates or neutrals, but did not differ at the level of early conflict detection. Their feedback potential results showed a greater expectation of rewards but reduced subjective magnitude attributed to losses. Subordinates, on the other hand, were asymmetrically sensitive to power-holders' targets. They expected fewer rewards, but attributed greater significance to losses. Our study shows that power corrupts balanced co-operation with subordinates. © The Author (2012).","Attention; Cooperation; Dual-EEG; ERP; Power","Adolescent; Brain; Cognition; Conflict (Psychology); Cooperative Behavior; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Feedback, Physiological; Humans; Male; Motivation; Neuropsychological Tests; Power (Psychology); Reaction Time; Reward; Social Dominance; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult; attention; cooperation; dual-EEG; ERP; power; adolescent; article; attention; behavior; brain; cognition; conflict; cooperation; dual-EEG; electroencephalography; ERP; evoked response; feedback system; human; male; motivation; neuropsychological test; physiology; power; reaction time; reward; social dominance; task performance; young adult","","","","","","","Bellebaum C., Kobza S., Thiele S., Daum I., It was not MY fault: event-related brain potentials in active and observational learning from feedback, Cerebral Cortex, 20, pp. 2874-2883, (2010); Berscheid E., Graziano W., Monson T., Dermer M., Outcome dependency: Attention, attribution, and attraction, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, pp. 978-989, (1976); Boksem M.A.S., Kostermans E., Milivojevic B., De Cremer D., Social status determines how we monitor and evaluate our performance, Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 7, pp. 304-313, (2012); Eriksen B., Eriksen C.W., Effects of noise letters upon the identification of a target letter in a nonsearch task, Perception and Psychophysics, 16, pp. 143-149, (1974); Fiske S.T., Controlling other people, American Psychologist, 48, pp. 621-628, (1993); Folstein J.R., Van Petten C., Influence of cognitive control and mismatch on the N2 component of the ERP: a review, Psychophysiology, 45, pp. 152-170, (2008); Galinsky A.D., Magee J.C., Inesi M.E., Gruenfeld D.H., Power and perspectives not taken, Psychological Science, 17, pp. 1068-1074, (2006); Gehring W.J., Willoughby A.R., The medial frontal cortex and the rapid processing of monetary gains and losses, Science, 295, pp. 2279-2282, (2002); Guinote A., Behaviour variability and the Situated Focus Theory of Power, European Review of Social Psychology, 18, pp. 256-295, (2007); Guinote A., Power affects basic cognition: Increased attentional inhibition and flexibility, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43, pp. 685-697, (2007); Holroyd C.B., Coles M.G.H., The neural basis of human error processing: Reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity, Psychological Review, 109, pp. 679-709, (2002); Itagaki S., Katayama J., Self-relevant criteria determine the evaluation of outcomes induced by others, NeuroReport, 19, pp. 383-387, (2008); Johnston V.S., Miller D.R., Burleson M.H., Multiple P3s to emotional stimuli and their theoretical significance, Psychophysiology, 23, pp. 684-694, (1986); Keltner D., Gruenfeld D.H., Anderson C., Power, approach, and inhibition, Psychological Review, 110, pp. 265-284, (2003); Kipnis D., Does power corrupt?, Journal of personality and social psychology, 24, pp. 33-41, (1972); Kluger A.N., DeNisi A., The effects of feedback interventions on performance: A historical review, a meta-analysis, and a preliminary feedback intervention theory, Psychological Bulletin, 119, pp. 254-284, (1996); Kopp B., Rist F., Mattler U., N200 in the flanker task as a neurobehavioural tool for investigating executive control, Psychophysiology, 33, pp. 282-294, (1996); Lammers J., Galinsky A.D., Gordijn E.H., Otten S., Illegitimacy moderates the effects of power on approach, Psychological Science, 19, pp. 558-564, (2008); Luck S.J., An Introduction to Event-related Potentials and their Neural Origins, (2005); Marco-Pallares J., Kramer U.M., Strehl S., Schroder A., Munte T.F., When decisions of others matter to me: an electrophysiological analysis, BMC Neuroscience, 11, (2010); Miltner W.H.R., Braun C.H., Coles M.G.H., Event-related brain potentials following incorrect feedback in a time-estimation task: Evidence for a ""generic"" neural system for error detection, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 9, pp. 788-798, (1997); Nieuwenhuis S., Aston-Jones G., Cohen J.D., Decision making, the P3, and the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system, Psychological Bulletin, 131, pp. 510-532, (2005); Pittman T.S., Agostino P.R.D., Motivation and cognition: Control deprivation and the nature of subsequent information processing, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 25, pp. 465-480, (1989); Polich J., Updating P300: an integrative theory of P3a and P3b, Clinical Neurophysiology, 118, pp. 2128-2148, (2007); Posner M.I., Dehaene S., Attentional networks, Trends in Neurosciences, 17, pp. 75-79, (1994); Posner M.I., Petersen S.E., The attention system of the human brain, Annual Review of Neuroscience, 13, pp. 25-42, (1990); Sebanz N., Rebbechi D., Knoblich G., Prinz W., Frith C.D., Is it really my turn?

We discuss the factors that promote respondents' willingness to compromise with two very different outgroups. We present a framework in which altruistic motivations (such as empathy) and egoistic motivations (such as trust and symbolic threat) act as proximal predictors of compromise, with intergroup contact as a distal predictor. We found that respondents who had more positive contact with homosexuals perceived them to be less threatening, and felt more empathy towards them, and in turn, were more likely to compromise with them on group-specific issues (controlling for the general tendency to compromise). We also found that respondents who had more negative contact with Muslims perceived them to be more threatening, and in turn, were less likely to compromise with them. We discuss these results with reference to recent developments in intergroup relations and the state of public discourse in contemporary Britain, examine their implications for intergroup relations in pluralistic contexts, and make suggestions for future research on willingness to compromise with outgroups. © 2012 Government and Opposition Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Discrimination: Conditions, Consequences and ""Cures"" ; Sherif M., Harvey O.J., Jack White B., Hood W.R., Sherif C.W., Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation: The Robbers Cave Experiment, (1961); Rawls J., Political Liberalism, (1996); Hennessey B.A., Amabile T.M., Reward, Intrinsic Motivation, and Creativity, American Psychologist, 53, 6, pp. 674-5, (1998); Crisp R.J., Turner R.N., Cognitive Adaptation to the Experience of Social and Cultural Diversity, Psychological Bulletin, 137, 2, pp. 242-6, (2011); Berlin I., The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the History of Ideas, (1990); Bellamy R., Liberalism and Pluralism: Towards a Politics of Compromise, (1999); Turner J.C., Hogg M.A., Oakes P.J., Reicher S.D., Wetherell M.S., Rediscovering the Social Group: A Self-Categorization Theory, (1987); Wright S.C., Lubensky M., The Struggle for Social Equality: Collective Action vs. Prejudice Reduction, pp. 291-310, (2008); Vertovec S., Super-Diversity and its Implications, Ethnic and Racial Studies, 29, 6, pp. 1024-54, (2007); Gaertner S.L., Dovidio J.F., The Aversive Form of Racism, pp. 61-89, (1986); McConahay J.B., Modern Racism, Ambivalence, and the Modern Racism Scale, pp. 91-125; Festinger L., A Theory of Social Comparison Processes, Human Relations, 7, 2, pp. 117-40, (1954); Daniel Batson C., Empathy-Induced Altruistic Motivation', paper presented at the Inaugural Herzliya Symposium on Prosocial Motives, Emotions, and Behavior, (2008); Daniel Batson C., Altruism in Humans, (2011); Daniel Batson C., Ahmad N.Y., Using Empathy to Improve Intergroup Attitudes and Relations, Social Issues and Policy Review, 3, 1, pp. 141-77, (2009); Pettigrew T.F., Tropp L.R., A Meta-Analytic Test of Intergroup Contact Theory, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 90, 5, pp. 751-83, (2006); Hewstone M., Living Apart, Living Together?

The present experiment explored whether imagining intergroup contact leads to more positive perceptions of outgroups differentially stereotyped on the two fundamental dimensions of social perception, namely warmth and competence. Depending on the experimental condition, participants (N = 123) imagined either an intergroup encounter with an outgroup member rated as high (vs. low) on warmth and competence or an outdoor scene. Results showed that imagining an intergroup encounter enhances warmth and competence perception of dehumanized groups, and promotes the perception of warmth and competence of envied and paternalized groups, respectively. These findings suggest that imagined contact could promote positive intergroup relationships toward a wide range of social groups, even dehumanized groups. © The Author(s) 2012.","Competence; Imagined contact; Intergroup contact; Stereotype content model; Warmth","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Blair I.V., Ma J.E., Lenton A.P., Imagining stereotypes away: The moderation of implicit stereotypes through mental imagery, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, pp. 828-841, (2001); Cameron L., Rutland A., Turner R., Holman-Nicolas R., Powell C., Changing attitudes with a little imagination: Imagined contact effects on young children's intergroup bias, Anales De Psicologia, 27, pp. 708-717, (2011); Crisp R.J., Birtel M.D., Meleady R., Mental simulations of social thought and action: Trivial tasks or tools for transforming social policy?, Current Directions In Psychological Science, 20, pp. 261-264, (2011); Crisp R.J., Husnu S., Attributional processes underlying imagined contact effects, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 14, pp. 275-287, (2011); Crisp R.J., Husnu S., Meleady R., Stathi S., Turner R.N., From imagery to intention: A dual route model of imagined contact effects, European Review of Social Psychology, 21, pp. 188-236, (2010); Crisp R.J., Stathi S., Turner R.N., Husnu S., Imagined intergroup contact: Theory, paradigm and practice, Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 3, pp. 1-18, (2009); Crisp R.J., Turner R.N., Can imagined interactions produce positive perceptions?

Two unique, large-scale national surveys, involving respondents sampled from neighborhoods of varying degrees of diversity in Germany (Study 1; N = 1,381 drawn from 50 different neighborhoods) and England (Study 2; N = 580 drawn from 192 different neighborhoods), tested the prediction that people living in ethnically diverse neighborhoods would be higher in social identity complexity and, in turn, hold less negative intergroup attitudes. Results confirmed this hypothesis, showing that greater diversity was directly associated with higher social identity complexity (Studies 1 and 2) and indirectly associated with less in-group bias (Studies 1 and 2), and less social distance (Study 2), via social identity complexity.

First, we explicitly consider the ethnic composition of organizations, distinguishing involvement in bridging (with out-group members) and bonding (only in-group members) organizations. Second, we start from constrict theory and test competing sets of predictions derived from conflict and contact theories to explain these relationships. Third, we examine whether relative out-group size affects involvement in different types of voluntary organizations equally. Using data from the 2005 U.S. 'Citizenship, Involvement, Democracy' survey, the percentage of non-Whites in neighborhoods is largely unrelated with associational involvement or perceived ethnic threat. However, perceiving ethnic threat is consistently negatively related with involvement in bridging organizations. Simultaneously, a larger percentage of non-Whites fosters intergroup contact, which is negatively related with perceptions of ethnic threat and involvement in bonding leisure organizations. Our results shed more light on the relationship between the relative out-group size in neighborhoods and associational involvement as well as underlying explanations for this link. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Associational involvement; Bonding and bridging formal social capital; Intergroup contact; Perceived ethnic threat; Relative out-group size","Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Fear; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Leisure Activities; Organizations; Residence Characteristics; Social Capital; Social Environment; Social Identification; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; adolescent; adult; attitude; Caucasian; demography; ethnic group; fear; human; human relation; leisure; organization; questionnaire; social behavior; social capital; social environment; United States","","","","","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, (432-008-005)","This study is part of a project supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (grant number 432-008-005).

We reasoned that in common ingroup contexts, self-categorization, but not perceived complexity, would be positively related to intergroup bias. In contrast, in crossed categorization contexts, perceived complexity, but not self-categorization, would be negatively related to intergroup bias. In two studies, and in line with predictions, we found that while self-categorization and intergroup bias were related in common ingroup contexts, this was not the case in crossed categorization contexts. Moreover, we found that perceived category complexity, and not self-categorization, predicted bias in crossed categorization contexts. We discuss the implications of these findings for models of social categorization and intergroup bias. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","Common ingroup; Complexity; Intergroup bias; Self-categorization;

Data were collected at two time points: At Time 1, baseline stereotypes and SDO were assessed, and at Time 2, either moderately or extremely stereotype-inconsistent information was presented and stereotyping measures were repeated. Consistent with previous research, exposure to moderately inconsistent information resulted in greater stereotype change than exposure to extremely inconsistent information. As expected, SDO was negatively related to stereotype change, in particular after presentation of moderately inconsistent information. The judged typicality of the target exemplar mediated the effects of the manipulation but did not mediate the effects of SDO.

The present article highlights the general relevance of this scientific approach and describes the background, generation, and application of cross-sectional as well as longitudinal network statistics that are of specific interest to group researchers.

In Study 1, White British participants reported less internal motivation to control prejudice against people with schizophrenia than against Black people. In Study 2, Jamaican participants reported less internal motivation to control anti-homosexual prejudice than did either British participants or American participants. Other differences in motivation to control prejudice were smaller, absent, or at odds with this difference, indicating that differences in motivation to control anti-homosexual prejudice were not solely due to cultural differences concerning motivation to control prejudice in general.

In study 2, we included intergroup anxiety as a mediator explaining these relationships, and we ruled out ingroup friendship as a potential confound. We found that the relationships between openness to experience and agreeableness on the one hand and outgroup attitude on the other were mediated by reduced intergroup anxiety. In addition, the effect of extraversion on outgroup attitude operated via an increase in cross-group friendship that was in turn associated with lower levels of intergroup anxiety. Across both studies, the friendship-attitude relationship was stronger among those low in agreeableness and extraversion. We discuss the importance of integrating personality and situational approaches to prejudice reduction in optimizing the impact of contact-based interventions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Agreeableness; Cross-group friendships; Extraversion; Intergroup anxiety; Openness to experience","","","","","","","","Adorno T.W., Frenkel-Brunswick E., Levinson D.J., Stanford R.N., The authoritarian personality, (1950); Akrami N., Ekehammar B., Yang-Wallentin F., Personality and social psychology factors explaining sexism, Journal of Individual Differences, 32, pp. 153-160, (2011); Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Voci A., Cairns E., Hughes J., It's never too late for 'us' to meet 'them': Prior intergroup friendships moderate the impact of later intergroup friendships in educational settings, British Journal of Social Psychology, 83, pp. 57-75, (2013); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Altemeyer B., Enemies of Freedom: Understanding right-wing authoritarianism, (1988); Aronson E., Worchel P., Similarity versus liking as determinants of interpersonal attractiveness, Psychonomic Science, 5, pp. 157-158, (1966); Asbrock F., Christ O., Duckitt J., Sibley C.G., Differential effects of intergroup contact for authoritarians and social dominators: A dual process model perspective, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 38, pp. 477-490, (2012); Asbrock F., Sibley C.G., Duckitt J., Right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation and the dimensions of generalized prejudice: A longitudinal test, European Journal of Personality, 24, pp. 324-340, (2010); Bagozzi R.P., Heatherton T.F., A general approach to representing multifaceted personality constructs: Application to state self-esteem, Structural Equation Modeling, 1, pp. 35-67, (1994); Binder J., Zagefka H., Brown R., Maquil A., Demoulin S., Leyens J.-P., Does contact reduce prejudice or does prejudice reduce contact?

Using two large, cross-sectional data sets from Germany (N = 1,381) and Northern Ireland (N = 1,948), this article examined the extent to which STEs of intergroup contact on attitudes towards a range of secondary outgroups occur via a previously unexplored psychological construct, social identity complexity (operationalized as similarity complexity and overlap complexity). Study 1 found primary outgroup contact to be associated with greater similarity complexity, but no indirect effects on secondary outgroup attitudes via complexity emerged. Study 2, however, revealed indirect positive relationships between primary outgroup contact and secondary outgroup attitudes via increased similarity complexity and overlap complexity. These relationships were obtained while controlling for two previously tested mediating mechanisms, attitude generalization (operationalized as primary outgroup attitude) and deprovincialization (operationalized as ingroup attitude and identification). We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and the contribution of social identity complexity to understanding processes underlying STEs of contact. © 2013 The British Psychological Society.","Attitude generalization; Deprovincialization; Intergroup contact; Secondary transfer effects; Social identity complexity","Adult; Attitude; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Germany; Group Processes; Gypsies; Homosexuality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Northern Ireland; Russia; Social Behavior; Social Identification; Social Perception; Transfer (Psychology); Turkey; adult; attitude; cross-sectional study; ethnology; female; Germany; group process; homosexuality; human; learning; male; middle aged; perception; Romani (people); Russian Federation; social behavior; Turkey; United Kingdom","","","","","","","Brewer M.B., The psychology of prejudice: In-group love or out-group hate?, Journal of Social Issues, 55, pp. 429-444, (1999); Brewer M., Deprovincialization, social identity complexity and outgroup acceptance, Improving intergroup relations.

Study 2 replicated the main results, using both Asians and Gay men as outgroups, and showed that participants' ratings discriminated between the two discrete outgroups, with measures of contact and attitude being only meaningfully related within, but not between, outgroups.

The current study relies on a unique cross-sectional sample of the general population drawn from eight European countries (N = 7,042) to examine the relationship between intergroup contact with immigrants and attitudes toward primary (immigrants) and secondary (homosexuals and Jews) outgroups. Results showed that intergroup contact was not only directly related with primary outgroup attitudes but also indirectly associated with secondary outgroup attitudes, via attitude generalization. These relationships occurred primarily for individuals low in social dominance orientation. Findings are discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding secondary transfer effects of contact as well as the role of social dominance orientation as a moderator of such effects. © American Sociological Association 2012.","intergroup attitudes; intergroup contact; intergroup relations; secondary transfer effects; social dominance orientation","","","","","","Freudenberg and Groeben foundation; University of Bielefeld; Compagnia di San Paolo; Leverhulme Trust; Volkswagen Foundation"," This research was initiated by Wilhelm Heitmeyer, University of Bielefeld, and funded by a grant on “Group-Focused Enmity in Europe” from the Compagnia di San Paolo, the Volkswagen foundation, the Freudenberg and Groeben foundation, and two additional private foundations, and was financially supported by the Institute of Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence at the University of Bielefeld.

This paper proposes a conceptual and operational framework to examine how individuals subjectively construe their in-group in the context of multiple, cross-cutting group memberships. The subjective combination of multiple social identities is described in terms of structure (social identity structure) and inclusiveness (social identity inclusiveness (SII)). Two studies assess SII and social identity structure in community samples to whom the subjective combination of multiple, cross-cutting in-groups is of particular relevance: a sample of Turkish-Belgian Muslims (Study 1) and Turkish-Australian Muslims (Study 2). Across both studies, SII uniquely predicted attitudes toward a range of out-groups, over and above identification with singular in-groups. Moreover, a wide range of social identity structures were identified, further attesting to broad individual differences in the construal of the perceived in-group. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP1093479);

In this paper, we focused on mixing in educational settings between members of Catholic and Protestant ethnoreligious groups in Northern Ireland. Aims. In Study 1, we examined whether opportunities for contact at home and at university were associated with greater actual out-group friendships, and whether this friendship was associated with a reduction in prejudice. We also assessed whether the impact of out-group friendships at university was moderated by experience of out-group friendships outside university, such that the prejudice-reducing effect of university friendships was stronger for those with fewer friendships at home. In Study 2, we assessed opportunities for contact and actual out-group friendships at prior stages of the educational system and their relationship with prejudice. Sample(s). In both studies, our participants were students at universities in Northern Ireland (Study 1 N= 304 and Study 2 N= 157). Methods. We analysed the data using multiple regression and structural equation modelling. Results. First, opportunities for contact were positively associated with self-reported out-group friendships in all domains and stages of the educational system. Second, having more out-group friends was associated with reduced prejudice. Finally, the relationship between out-group friendships and current levels of prejudice was moderated by prior levels of out-group friendships (at home in Study 1; and at secondary and primary school in Study 2). Conclusions. Contact, in the form of out-group friendships, was more powerful when it was a novel feature in a person's life. We discuss these findings in terms of the impact of mixing in educational contexts, especially in Northern Ireland, and outline suggestions for future research. © 2011 The British Psychological Society.","","Adult; Catholicism; Female; Friends; Group Processes; Humans; Male; Northern Ireland; Prejudice; Protestantism; Schools; Social Distance; Social Environment; Social Identification; Students; Universities; Young Adult; adult; article; female; friend; group process; human; male; psychological aspect; religion; school; social behavior; social distance; social environment; social psychology; statistics; student; United Kingdom; university","","","","","","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, (1991); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Arlow M., Citizenship education in a divided society: The case of Northern Ireland, Education, Conflict and Social Cohesion, pp. 255-314, (2004); Binder J., Zagefka H., Brown R., Funke F., Kessler T., Mummendey A., Leyens J.-P., Does contact reduce prejudice or does prejudice reduce contact?

Still, research on contact and prejudice against people with mental health disorders has generally focused on the broader label, ""mental illness,"" as though various disorders were interchangeable. The present research specifically investigated the relationship between intergroup contact and avoidance of people with schizophrenia - a particularly stigmatized and challenging group - as well as mediators of that relationship. In Study 1, 78 students completed measures of their prior contact with and prejudice against people with schizophrenia. Prior contact predicted less desired avoidance of people with schizophrenia, and this relationship was mediated by more favorable attitudes. Study 2 (N = 122) replicated the results of Study 1, and also found that less fear and less intergroup anxiety mediated the relationship between contact and avoidance. This suggests that contact may effectively reduce prejudice, even against this highly stigmatized group. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Contact hypothesis; mental illness; prejudice; schizophrenia","Adolescent; Anxiety; Attitude; Avoidance Learning; Defense Mechanisms; Fear; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Prejudice; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Social Distance; Social Identification; Social Stigma; Stereotyping; Students; Young Adult; adolescent; anxiety; article; attitude; avoidance behavior; defense mechanism; fear; female; human; human relation; male; prejudice; psychological aspect; psychology; schizophrenia; social behavior; social distance; social stigma; stereotyping; student; young adult","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Angermeyer M.C., Matschinger H., Social distance towards the mentally ill: Results of representative surveys in the Federal Republic of Germany, Psychological Medicine, 27, pp. 131-141, (1997); Angermeyer M.C., Matschinger H., Public beliefs about schizophrenia and depression: Similarities and differences, Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 38, pp. 526-534, (2003); Angermeyer M.C., Matschinger H., Causal beliefs and attitudes to people with schizophrenia: Trend analysis based on data from two population surveys in Germany, The British Journal of Psychiatry, 186, pp. 331-334, (2005); Arkar H., Eker D., Influence of having a hospitalized mentally ill member in the family on attitudes toward mental patients in Turkey, Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 27, pp. 151-155, (1992); Barlow F.K., Louis W.R., Hewstone M., Rejected!

The primary focus of this Special Issue is on the social-contextual factors that encourage forgiveness of past wrongs and the extent to which forgiveness results in meaningful improvement in intergroup relations. The concept of intergroup forgiveness has only appeared on the research agenda of social psychologists over the last decade, so there is still much room for conceptual clarification, empirical validation, and applications to understanding intergroup reconciliation. Significant progress has been made by investigating predictors and correlates of intergroup forgiveness, and the research presented in this Special Issue further illuminates the processes involved in intergroup forgiveness, as well as important consequences. This collection of empirical articles, based on diverse theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches to studying the phenomenon of intergroup forgiveness inside and outside of the laboratory, advance our understanding of when and how improvement emerges across a wide range of real and enduring conflicts. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","conflict;

In this chapter we review results from our own research program on the impact of diversity in secondary schools, i.e., the social environment in which adolescents spend most of their waking hours.

However, to the extent that strategies based on direct contact are sometimes difficult to implement, scholars have more recently focused on indirect contact. An effective form of indirect contact is extended contact. According to the extended contact hypothesis, simply knowing that ingroup members have outgroup friends (extended contact), or observing these friendships vicariously (vicarious contact), can improve intergroup relations. Since its initial formulation a large body of studies has supported the validity of the extended contact hypothesis. In reviewing the available literature on two forms of indirect contact (extended and vicarious), we outline a model that identifies their antecedents and consequences, spanning from cognitive to affective to behavioural outcomes. In addition to identifying the main moderators of indirect contact, we also distinguish two different routes, one cognitive and one affective, that underlie what processes mediate their effects. Finally, we indicate some possible avenues for future research and we consider how direct and indirect contact strategies can be used in combination to improve intergroup relations. © 2014, © 2014 European Association of Social Psychology.","Extended contact; Indirect contact; Intergroup contact; Intergroup relations; Prejudice reduction; Social networks; Vicarious contact","","","","","","Leverhulme Trust","Correspondence should be addressed to Loris Vezzali, Department of Education and Human Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, viale Allegri 9, 42121, Reggio Emilia, Italy.

Across seven large-scale surveys (five cross-sectional and two longitudinal), using multilevel analyses, we found a reliable contextual effect. This effect was found in multiple countries, operationalizing context at multiple levels (regions, districts, and neighborhoods), and with and without controlling for a range of demographic and context variables. In four studies (three cross-sectional and one longitudinal) we showed that the association between context-level contact and prejudice was largely mediated by more tolerant norms. In social contexts where positive contact with outgroups was more commonplace, norms supported such positive interactions between members of different groups. Thus, positive contact reduces prejudice on a macrolevel, whereby people are influenced by the behavior of others in their social context, not merely on a microscale, via individuals' direct experience of positive contact with outgroup members. These findings reinforce the view that contact has a significant role to play in prejudice reduction, and has great policy potential as a means to improve intergroup relations, because it can simultaneously impact large numbers of people.","Diversity; Multilevel analysis; Social norms; Trust","Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Psychological; Prejudice; Social Behavior; diversity; multilevel analysis; social norms; trust; article; attitude; controlled study; human; human relation; minority group; neighborhood; panel study; perception; policy; prejudice; priority journal; social behavior; social environment; social interaction","","","","","","","Hooghe M., Reeskens T., Stolle D., Trappers A., Ethnic diversity and generalized trust in europe: A cross-national multilevel study, Comp Polit Stud, 42, 2, pp. 198-223, (2009); Putnam R.D., E pluribus unum: Diversity and community in the twenty-first century.

Although recent decades have seen some advances in the promotion of integrated education, around 95% of children continue to attend schools separated on ethno-religious lines. In 2007 a programme for sharing education was established. Underpinned by intergroup contact theory, and reflecting educational priorities shared by all school sectors, the programme seeks to offer children from different denominational schools an opportunity to engage with each other on a sustained basis. In this article the authors adopt a quantitative approach to examining the impact of participation in the Sharing Education Programme on a range of outcomes (out-group attitudes, positive action tendencies and out-group trust) via, first, intergroup contact (cross-group friendships) and, second, intergroup anxiety. Their findings confirm the value of contact as a mechanism for promoting more harmonious relationships, and affirm the Sharing Education Programme as an initiative that can help promote social cohesion in a society that remains deeply divided.","","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research: conceptual strategic and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Berkeley R., Right to Divide: faith schools and community cohesion.

Though effects of perceptual manipulations on redundancy gains are established, effects of social associations are still unclear. Here, we examined for the first time whether associating arbitrary stimuli with in-group as opposed to out-group targets modulates redundancy gains. Participants made associations between a shape, a colour and either in- or out-group labels. They then had to discriminate whether in- or out-group stimuli appeared (single or redundant features). Responses to in-group but not to out-group stimuli violated predictions of models in which the associated features are processed independently, and were consistent with in-group stimuli being processed with super-capacity. Our results, replicated across two experiments, providing the first evidence that there is enhanced perceptual integration for information associated with an in-group. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","capacity coefficient; in-group; out-group; Redundancy gain","adult; Article; association; color; controlled study; female; functions of the sense organs and the sensory nervous system; human; human experiment; independent variable; intergroup bias; male; normal human; perceptive discrimination; prediction; priority journal; redundancy gains; response time; sensory stimulation; visual discrimination; visual stimulation","","","","","Wellcome Trust, WT; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council, ERC","This work was supported by grants from the Leverhulme Trust to the third and fourth authors and by the ESRC, the ERC and the Wellcome Trust to the last author.

While each theory has specific strengths and limitations depending on the victim’s sex, research hardly differentiates between intrasex and intersex aggression. In the present study, 11,307 students (mean age = 14.96 years; 50% girls, 50% boys) from 597 school classes provided social-network data (aggression and friendship networks) as well as physical (body mass index) and psychosocial (gender and masculinity norms) information. Aggression networks were used to disentangle intra- and intersex aggression, whereas their class-aggregated sex differences were analyzed using contextual predictors derived from sexual-selection and social-role theories. As expected, results revealed that sexual-selection theory predicted male-biased sex differences in intrasex aggression, whereas social-role theory predicted male-biased sex differences in intersex aggression. Findings suggest the value of explaining sex differences separately for intra- and intersex aggression with a dual-theory framework covering both evolutionary and normative components. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","aggression; sex differences; social-network analysis","Adolescent; Aggression; Cross-Cultural Comparison; England; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Netherlands; Regression Analysis; Schools; Sex Characteristics; Sexual Behavior; Social Support; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sweden; adolescent; aggression; cultural factor; England; female; Germany; human; male; Netherlands; psychology; questionnaire; regression analysis; school; sexual behavior; sexual development; social support; student; Sweden","","","","","","","Alpern S.B., Amazons of Black Sparta: The women warriors of Dahomey, (1998); Archer J., Sex differences in aggression in real-world settings: A meta-analytic review, Review of General Psychology, 8, pp. 291-322, (2004); Archer J., Cross-cultural differences in physical aggression between partners: A social-role analysis, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 10, pp. 133-153, (2006); Archer J., Does sexual selection explain human sex differences in aggression?, Behavioral & Brain Sciences, 32, pp. 249-311, (2009); Archer J., Refining the sexual selection explanation within an ethological framework, Behavioral & Brain Sciences, 32, pp. 292-300, (2009); Bandura A., Social learning theory, (1977); Bettencourt B.A., Miller N., Gender differences in aggression as a function of provocation: A meta-analysis, Psychological Bulletin, 119, pp. 422-447, (1996); Borgatti S.P., Mehra A., Brass D.J., Labianca G., Network analysis in the social sciences, Science, 323, pp. 892-895, (2009); Card N.A., Stucky B.D., Sawalani G.M., Little T.D., Direct and indirect aggression during childhood and adolescence: A meta-analytic review of gender differences, intercorrelations, and relations to maladjustment, Child Development, 79, pp. 1185-1229, (2008); Clutton-Brock T., Sexual selection in males and females, Science, 318, pp. 1882-1885, (2007); Crick N.R., Grotpeter J.K., Relational aggression, gender, and social-psychological adjustment, Child Development, 66, pp. 710-722, (1995); Darwin C., On the origin of species by means of natural selection, (1859); Darwin C., The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex, (1871); Eagly A.H., Sex differences in social behavior: A social-role interpretation, (1987); Eagly A.H., Steffen V.J., Gender and aggressive behavior: A meta-analytic review of the social psychological literature, Psychological Bulletin, 100, pp. 309-330, (1986); Eagly A.H., Wood W., The nature-nurture debates: 25 years of challenges in understanding the psychology of gender, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 8, pp. 340-357, (2013); Fernandez-Duque E., Valeggia C.R., Mendoza S.P., The biology of paternal care in human and nonhuman primates, Annual Review of Anthropology, 38, pp. 115-130, (2009); Freeman L.C., Centrality in social networks: Conceptual clarification, Social Networks, 1, pp. 215-239, (1979); Geary D.C., Evolution and developmental sex differences, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 8, pp. 115-120, (1999); Hilton N.Z., Harris G.T., Rice M.E., The functions of aggression by male teenagers, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, pp. 988-994, (2000); Hopcroft R.L., Sex, status, and reproductive success in the contemporary United States, Evolution & Human Behavior, 27, pp. 104-120, (2006); Huitsing G., van Duijna M.A.J., Snijders T.A.B., Wang P., Sainiod M., Salmivalli C., Veenstra R., Univariate and multivariate models of positive and negative networks: Liking, disliking, and bully-victim relationships, Social Networks, 34, pp. 645-657, (2012); Kalter F., Heath A.F., Hewstone M., Jonsson J.O., Kalmijn M., Kogan I., van Tubergen F., Children of immigrants longitudinal survey in four European countries, (2013); Kenrick D., Griskevicius V., More holes in social roles, Behavioral & Brain Sciences, 32, pp. 283-285, (2009); Kvarnemo C., Ahnesjo I., The dynamics of operational sex ratios and competition for mates, Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 11, pp. 404-408, (1996); Larsen C.S., Equality for the sexes in human evolution?

The past decade has witnessed a dramatic resurgence of interest in this time-tested phenomenon, with researchers now focusing on understanding when, why, and for whom contact does (and does not) work.; This new volume focuses on one of the hottest topics in the social sciences: Prejudice. Covering not only basic principles but cutting-edge findings and theoretical directions, key questions surrounding this subject are addressed, such as.; How perceptions of other groups lead to anxiety and avoidance;; How cross-group contact influences the development of prejudice in children;; Whether highly-prejudiced people benefit from contact;; How status and power influence the effectiveness of contact.; In addition to exploring methodological challenges facing contact researchers, attention is devoted to prejudice interventions that are rooted in our understanding of contact effects. These range from zero-acquaintance contact to intimate cross-group friendships, and even involve simulated contact experiences.; This volume draws together world-renowned experts in prejudice and intergroup contact to provide a long-awaited update on the state of affairs in intergroup contact research. As well as synthesizing and integrating the key topics, it also provides possible new directions for future research. Given the prominence of contact as a powerful prejudice-reduction tool, this book is a must-read for students and scholars of social psychology and sociology, as well as policy-makers and practitioners. © 2013 Psychology Press.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-020309546-1","","","English","Advances in Intergroup Contact","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920543965"

Football fans were instructed to associate the badges of their favorite football team (in-group), a rival team (out-group), and neutral teams with simple geometric shapes. Responses to matching in-group stimuli were more efficient, and discriminability was enhanced, as compared to out-group stimuli (rival and neutral)—a result that occurred even when participants responded only to the (equally familiar) geometric shapes. Across individuals, the in-group bias on shape matching was correlated with measures of group satisfaction, and similar results were found when football fans performed the task, in the context of both the football ground and a laboratory setting. We also observed effects of in-group bias on the response criteria in some but not all of the experiments. In control studies, the advantage for in-group stimuli was not found in an independent sample of participants who were not football fans. This indicates that there was not an intrinsic advantage for the stimuli that were “in-group” for football fans. Also, performance did not differ for familiar versus unfamiliar stimuli without in-group associations. These findings indicate that group identification can affect simple shape matching. © 2015, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Cognitive bias; Football fans; In-group; Out-group","Adult; Association Learning; Attention; Discrimination Learning; Humans; Male; Motivation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time; Recognition (Psychology); Soccer; Social Identification; adult; attention; discrimination learning; human; learning; male; motivation; pattern recognition; psychology; reaction time; recognition; soccer; social behavior","","","","","European Research Council; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation, NSF; Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council, ERC, (323833); European Research Council, ERC","This work was supported by grants from the Leverhulme Trust to the third and fourth authors, by ERC Advanced Investigator Award No. 323833 (PePe) to the fourth author, and by a grant from the National Science Foundation, China, to the second author.

Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that a neutral imagined contact task can have negative effects, compared to a control condition, even when paired with incidental positive information (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated, however, that an integrated positive imagined contact scenario does result in less intergroup anxiety and more positive attitudes, even toward this challenging group. Analyses of participants' descriptions of the imagined interactions in and across the first three studies confirm that positive and high quality imagined contact is important for reducing prejudice, but failing to ensure that imagined contact is positive may have deleterious consequences. We emphasize the importance of investigating the quality of the imagined contact experience, and discuss the implications for using imagined contact as a prejudice-reducing intervention. © The Author(s) 2011.","cognitive bias; contact hypothesis; imagined contact; mental imagery; prejudice; schizophrenia","","","","","","Wellcome Trust, WT; Lupina Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Royal Society"," emily holmes is a Senior Research Fellow and Wellcome Trust Intermediate Clinical Fellow at the University of Oxford’s Department of Psychiatry. She is a Clinical Psychologist with a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience. Dr. Holmes is known for her clinical expertise and research in mental imagery—particularly trauma memory, with current work also reaching into depression and bipolar disorder. Dr Holmes’ present work in experimental psychopathology seeks to understand cognitive mechanisms underlying distress across psychological disorders. In particular she is interested in the impact of mental imagery on emotional processing, and the impact of processing biases in the way people interpret information. Dr Holmes receives research grant support from the Wellcome Trust, Royal Society, ESRC, and the Lupina Foundation.

Results revealed a substantial relationship between 2 types of intergroup contact-cross-group friendship and extended contact-and lower levels of prejudice. While cross-group friendships were associated with more positive intergroup relations via the mediating mechanisms of self-disclosure and empathy with the out-group, extended contact worked by eliciting positive perceived peer norms toward the out-group. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for intergroup relations among children in conflict societies. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Altman I., Taylor D.A., Social penetration: The development of interpersonal relationships, (1973); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423, (1988); Arbuckle J.L., (2004); Aron A., Aron E.N., Tudor M., Nelson G., Close relationships as including other in the self, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, pp. 241-253, (1991); Astin A., Minorities in higher education, (1982); Batson C., Polycarpou M.P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings toward the group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 105-118, (1997); Berg J.H., Wright-Buckley C., Effects of racial similarity and interviewer intimacy in a peer counseling analogue, Journal of Counseling Psychology, 35, pp. 377-384, (1988); Bettencourt B.A., Bartholow B.D., The importance of status legitimacy for intergroup attitudes among numerical minorities, Journal of Social Issues, 54, pp. 759-775, (1998); Braddock J.H., McPartland J.M., Social psychological processes that perpetuate racial segregation: The relationship between school and employment desegregation, Journal of Black Studies, 19, pp. 267-289, (1989); Cameron L., Rutland A., Brown R., Douch R., Changing children's intergroup attitudes towards refugees: Testing different models of extended contact, Child Development, 77, pp. 1208-1219, (2006); Carlson C.I., Lein L., (1998); Coke J.S., Batson C., McDavis K., Empathic mediation of helping: A two-stage model, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36, pp. 752-766, (1978); Davis M.H., Empathy: A social psychological approach, (1994); Ensari N., Miller N., The out-group must not be so bad after all: The effects of disclosure, typicality, and salience on intergroup bias, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, pp. 313-329, (2002); Finlay K.A., Stephan W.G., Improving intergroup relations: The effects of empathy on racial attitudes, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 30, pp. 1720-1737, (2000); Fiske S.T., Neuberg S.L., A continuum model of impression formation: From category-based to individuating processes as a function of information, motivation, and attention, Advances in experimental social psychology, 23, pp. 1-74, (1990); Fraser G., Morgan V., Integrated education in Northern Ireland: The implications of expansion, (1999); Galinsky A.D., Moskowitz G.B., Perspective-taking: Decreasing stereotype expression, stereotype accessibility, and in-group favoritism, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 708-724, (2000); Gallagher A., Education and equality in Northern Ireland, Researching the troubles: Social science perspectives on the Northern Ireland conflict, pp. 59-84, (2003); Hallinan M., Teixeira R., Opportunities and constraints: Black-White differences in the formation of interracial friendships, Child Development, 58, pp. 1358-1371, (1987); Hargie O., Dickson D., Mallett J., Stringer M., Communicating social identity: A study of Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, Communication Research, 8, pp. 792-821, (2008); Harwood J., Hewstone M., Paolini S., Voci A., Grandparent-grandchild contact and attitudes toward older adults: Moderator and mediator effects, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 393-406, (2005); Haslam S.A., McGarty C., Turner J.C., Salient group membership and persuasion: The role of social identity in the validation of beliefs, What is social about social cognition?

Study 1, an observational study, showed extensive resegregation between White and Asian students in the cafeteria of a highly mixed school. In Study 2, we found evidence of attributional correspondence for White students, who attributed both their own and the outgroup's contact avoidance more to a lack of interest than fear of rejection, whereas Asian students attributed the outgroup's contact avoidance more to lack of interest, but preferred neither explanation of their own avoidance. In Study 3, we observed a pattern of attributional correspondence among both White and Asian students who attributed both their own and the outgroup's inaction in a hypothetical intergroup cafeteria scenario more to a lack of interest than fear of rejection. Study 3 also demonstrated longitudinally, for both groups, that own lack of interest in the outgroup reduced likelihood of cafeteria contact, whereas having outgroup friends and perceiving positive ingroup norms promoted it. In addition, positive outgroup norms promoted likelihood of cafeteria contact only for Asian students. We discuss how an understanding of the factors driving resegregation is critical to effectively realizing the potential of desegregated settings. © 2014 The British Psychological Society.","Apathy; Attributions; Desegregation; Intergroup contact; Longitudinal; Norms; Resegregation","Adolescent; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Attitude; Child; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Friends; Group Structure; Humans; Male; Peer Influence; Racism; Social Identification; Social Marginalization; Social Norms; Social Perception; Students; adolescent; Asian continental ancestry group; attitude; Caucasian; child; ethnology; female; friend; group structure; human; male; peer pressure; perception; psychology; racism; social behavior; social exclusion; social norm; student","","","","","","","Aboud F.E., Sankar J., Friendship and identity in a language-integrated school, International Journal of Behavioural Development, 31, pp. 445-453, (2007); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Intergroup contact as a tool for reducing, resolving and preventing intergroup conflict: Evidence, limitations and potential, American Psychologist, 68, pp. 527-542, (2013); Al Ramiah A., Hewstone M., Voci A., Cairns E., Hughes J., It's never too late for 'us' to meet 'them': Prior intergroup friendship moderates the impact of later intergroup friendship in educational settings, British Journal of Educational Psychology, 83, pp. 57-75, (2013); Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Almack J.C., The influence of intelligence on the selection of associates, School and Society, 16, pp. 529-530, (1922); Binder J., Zagefka H., Brown R., Funke F., Kessler T., Mummendey A., Leyens J.-P., Does contact reduce prejudice or does prejudice reduce contact?

In contexts of both mild (Study 1) and more severe (Study 2) intergroup conflict, respect for persons predicted action tendencies towards outgroup members: those who value the intrinsic worth of others (high respect for persons) expressed less negative and more positive action tendencies towards outgroup members than did those with low respect for persons. These effects were obtained while controlling for Social Dominance Orientation and Agreeableness (Study 1). Further, the effects of respect for persons on action tendencies were shown to be partially mediated by self-other overlap and intergroup emotions. The findings support previous work in suggesting that respect for persons is an important predictor in intergroup contexts, and they highlight potential mechanisms through which respect might operate © The Author(s) 2009.","Action tendencies;

According to Rotenberg and colleagues’ framework of interpersonal trust (e.g., Rotenberg, 1991; Rotenberg and Morgan, 1995; Rotenberg, Fox, Green, Ruderman, Slater, Stevens, and Carlo, 2005), trust consists of three important components: reliability, emotionality, and honesty. In an intergroup context, reliability refers to whether promises made by the outgroup are fulfilled; emotionality refers to whether the outgroup refrains from causing emotional harm to the ingroup; and honesty refers to whether the outgroup is perceived as telling the truth, and behaving in a benign rather than in a malicious or manipulative way towards the ingroup. Trust is crucial if society is to function effectively, because the formation and maintenance of interpersonal relationships is dependent on our ability to trust one another (e.g., Rotenberg, 1991; Rotter, 1980). Our ability to trust others has diverse psychological consequences, particularly among children. According to attachment theory, the quality of a child’s relationship with their caregivers can affect their beliefs about whether others are trustworthy and, subsequently, their ability to have successful relationships (Bridges, 2003). Similarly, it is important for children that they are able to trust their peers, and know that they will be honest, reliable, and benevolent (Bernath and Feshbach, 1995). © Cambridge University Press 2010.","","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Altman I., Taylor D.A., Social penetration: The development of interpersonal relationships, (1973); Batson C.D., Shaw L.L., Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives, Psychological Enquiry, 2, pp. 107-122, (1991); Batson C.D., Polycarpou M.P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Mitchener E.C., Bednar L.L., Klein T.R., Highberger L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings towards the group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 105-118, (1997); Bernath M.S., Feshbach N.D., Children's trust: Theory, assessment, development, and research directions, Applied & Preventive Psychology, 4, pp. 1-19, (1995); Blackstock M.D., Where is the trust?

I summarize the debate, and argue that the efficacy of direct, face-to-face intergroup contact as a means of reducing prejudice is a stark omission, as I illustrate with evidence of the association between diversity, on the one hand, and trust, prejudice, and social capital on the other. I also consider two other contributions of contact theory to this issue, namely that contact with members of one group has an impact on attitudes toward members of other groups; and that contact should be studied via social networks. Despite the importance I attach to contact, I note two ""enemies of contact,"" resegregation in ostensibly desegregated settings, and negatively valenced contact. Finally, I point to the kind of research we should do, in order to increase the impact of our work on the public policy debate on this issue. © 2015 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.","","psychology; research; social behavior","","","","","","","Al Ramiah A., Schmid K., Hewstone M., Floe C., Why are all the White (Asian) kids sitting together in the cafeteria?

Among religious participants, strength of religious attitude predicted prejudice, as did SDO. Among non-religious participants, SDO positively, and intergroup contact negatively, predicted prejudice. We also found that non-religious participants were more vulnerable than religious participants to the effects of mortality salience, indicating that mere religious affiliation can be an effective buffer against existential threat.

Social comparison moderated the impact of extended cross-group friendships on attitudes to both Asians (significantly) and gay men (marginally). There were no reliable effects of public self-consciousness. These results are consistent with findings that extended cross-group friendship works primarily when individuals attach importance to social norms, and that attitudes towards some outgroups (e.g., ethnic outgroups) are more influenced by norms than are other attitudes (e.g., attitudes towards gay men). We argue that the moderation effect of social comparison does not weaken the potential of extended contact to reduce prejudice, because intergroup encounters typically involve some degree of uncertainty and foster reliance on social norms. © The Author(s) 2011.","cross-group friendship; extended contact; indirect contact; intergroup contact; public self-consciousness; social comparison","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","This research was funded by a doctoral research award to Melanie Sharp from the Economic and Social Research Council.

We tested the relationship between neighborhood diversity and out-group, in-group, and neighborhood trust, taking into consideration previously untested indirect effects via intergroup contact and perceived intergroup threat. A large-scale national survey in England sampled White British majority (N = 868) and ethnic minority (N = 798) respondents from neighborhoods of varying degrees of diversity. Multilevel path analyses showed some negative direct effects of diversity for the majority group but also confirmed predictions that diversity was associated indirectly with increased trust via positive contact and lower threat. These indirect effects had positive implications for total effects of diversity, cancelling out most negative direct effects. Our findings have relevance for a growing body of research seeking to disentangle effects of diversity on trust that has so far largely ignored the key role of intergroup contact. © The Author(s) 2014.","in-group trust; intergroup contact; intergroup dynamics; neighborhood diversity; neighborhood trust; out-group trust; perceived threat; racial and ethnic attitudes and relations","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cultural Diversity; England; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multilevel Analysis; Racism; Residence Characteristics; Social Identification; Social Perception; Trust; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; cultural anthropology; demography; ethnic group; female; human; male; middle aged; multilevel analysis; perception; racism; social behavior; trust; United Kingdom; very elderly; young adult","","","","","Leverhulme Trust","","Alesina A., la Ferrara E., Who trusts others?, Journal of Public Economics, 85, pp. 207-234, (2002); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Antonio A.L., Chang M.J., Hakuta K., Kenny D.A., Levin S., Milem J.F., Effects of racial diversity on complex thinking in college students, Psychological Science, 15, pp. 507-510, (2004); Blalock H.M., Per cent non-white and discrimination in the South, American Sociological Review, 22, pp. 677-682, (1967); Bobo L.D., Prejudice as a sense of group position: Microfoundations of a sociological approach to racism and race relations, Journal of Social Issues, 17, pp. 445-472, (1999); Brown R.J., Hewstone M., Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, pp. 255-331, (2005); Christ O., Wagner U., Advances in Intergroup Contact, pp. 223-261, (2012); Foddy M., Platow M.J., Yamagishi T., Group-based trust in strangers: The role of stereotypes and expectations, Psychological Science, 20, pp. 419-422, (2009); Gesthuizen M., van der Meer T., Scheepers P., Ethnic diversity and social capital in Europe: Tests of Putnam's thesis in European countries, Scandinavian Political Studies, 32, pp. 121-142, (2008); Hirschman A.O., The paternity of an index, American Economic Review, 54, pp. 761-762, (1964); Hooghe M., Reeskens T., Stolle D., Trappers A., Ethnic diversity and generalized trust in Europe: A cross-national multilevel study, Comparative Political Studies, 42, pp. 198-223, (2009); Kollock P., The emergence of exchange structures: An experimental study of uncertainty, commitment, and trust, American Journal of Sociology, 100, pp. 313-345, (1994); Kramer R.M., Trust and distrust in organizations: Emerging perspectives, enduring questions, Annual Review of Psychology, 50, pp. 569-598, (1999); Kramer R.M., Carnevale P.J., Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup Processes, pp. 431-450, (2001); Lancee B., Dronkers J., Ethnic, religious and economic diversity in Dutch neighborhoods: Explaining quality of contact with neighbors, trust in the neighborhood and interethnic trust, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 37, pp. 597-618, (2011); Letki N., Does diversity erode social cohesion?

Experiment 1 provided a precise comparison between discrimination against single outgroups, partial outgroups, and double outgroups. Intergroup bias and perceived intergroup similarity followed an additive pattern such that partial outgroups were discriminated against as much as single outgroups, whereas both were discriminated against to a lesser extent than double outgroups. In Experiment 2, a more realistic form of crossing was employed whereby five additional dimensions of categorization were considered by participants instead of the traditional two. In line with a decategorization perspective, intergroup bias was reduced in both multiple group conditions relative to the single categorization (baseline) condition. Participants perceived a weakened intergroup structure and displayed a greater tendency to see outgroup members as individuals in multiple group conditions; however, only perceived intergroup structure mediated the pattern of intergroup bias. The implications of these findings for conceptualizations of crossed categorization are discussed.","","","","","","","","","Allen V.L., Wilder D.A., Categorization, belief similarity, and intergroup discrimination, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 32, pp. 971-977, (1975);

In Study 1, archival data from two different surveys in 1989 (N = 310 Catholics, 422 Protestants) and 1991 (N = 319 Catholics, 478 Protestants) showed that contact was positively related to attitudes toward denominational mixing. Study 2 (N = 391 Catholics, 647 Protestants) explored predictors of intergroup forgiveness, and also showed that intergroup contact was positively related to outgroup attitudes, perspective-taking, and trust (even among those who had a worse experience of sectarian conflict).

In both surveys the results indicated a general in-group bias - feeling thermometer ratings (affect) for the in-group exceeded those for the out-group. This effect was moderated by participants' in-group identification and religious group (Catholic or Protestant), but these moderations also varied as a function of differential sectarian tension between 2000 and 2001. In both years, high identifiers and Protestants exhibited more in-group bias than low identifiers and Catholics, respectively. © 2006 The British Psychological Society.","","Adult; Affect; Conflict (Psychology);

As we enter only its fifth year, we have already seen unprecedented incidents of international conflict and terrorism (e.g., Afghanistan, 2002; Iraq, 2003; Spain, 2004; USA, 2001), a rising tide of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in Europe and elsewhere (e.g., Allen & Nielson, 2002), and increasingly hostile immigration receptions experienced by refugees (e.g., MORI, 2003). The task of ameliorating these problematic intergroup relationships will be arduous and complex, undoubtedly necessitating fundamental economic and political transformations, aided by the coordinated efforts of several social science disciplines. In this article, we consider the contribution that social psychology might make to such an endeavor, focusing particularly on the role of intergroup contact in reducing prejudice and in generating more favorable intergroup attitudes and stereotypes. We begin, appropriately enough in this the half centenary of its publication, with a brief reassessment of Allport's (1954) classic 'Contact Hypothesis' (see also Dovidio, Gaertner, & Kawakami, 2003). Although Allport was by no means the first to advocate bringing groups together as a means of prejudice reduction (Watson, 1947; Williams, 1947), his theorizing in The Nature of Prejudice has justly acquired landmark status because of its lucid exposition, penetrating insights, and careful analysis of the social conditions likely to facilitate the beneficial effects of contact on intergroup attitudes and behavior. As we shall show, there is now ample evidence to support his basic contentions. However, the past 50 years have also seen important theoretical and empirical developments of the Contact Hypothesis-in particular, Brewer and Miller's (1984) decategorization model, Gaertner and Dovidio's (2000) common in-group identity model, Hewstone and Brown's (1986) intergroup contact model, and Pettigrew's (1998) theory of longitudinal contact. In this article, we aim to provide a critical assessment of these developments, focusing mainly on our own model, which provided the point of departure for our own broad research program on contact over nearly 20 years. Although our original model was conceived partly as a riposte to Brewer and Miller's (1984) principal hypothesis, and it contrasts in key respects with Gaertner and Dovidio's (2000) subsequent alternative, the evidence that has accumulated, both from our own research and that of others, now suggests to us that some rapprochement of these apparently contradictory accounts is not only possible but also highly desirable. Later in the article, we discuss how this might be achieved. We will start with a brief re-presentation of Allport's (1954) classic hypothesis and show, with reference to recent cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys, laboratory experiments, and meta-analysis, that many of his original propositions have capably withstood the test of time. We then examine Brewer and Miller's (1984) and Gaertner and Dovidio's (2000) attempts to extend the Contact Hypothesis, in both of which categorization processes play a key role. This approach sets the stage for own model, first published in 1986 (Hewstone & Brown, 1986) and subsequently modified (Hewstone, 1996; Vivian, Hewstone, & Brown, 1997). In that model, we were concerned with identifying the conditions that would allow the generalization of attitudes and behavior change beyond the specific context in which the contact occurs. We hypothesized that group salience-broadly speaking, the extent to which group memberships are psychologically 'present' during contact-would play a key role in encouraging such generalization, essentially suggesting that it moderates the effects of contact on prejudice reduction. We are now in a position to evaluate that hypothesis in the light of the extensive evidence that has accumulated from a wide variety of contact settings. A major portion of the article is dedicated to a review of that evidence. A further goal of our theorizing has been to understand the processes that mediate the link between contact and improved intergroup attitudes. In this review, we highlight what seems to be one of the most important of those mediating factors, intergroup anxiety. However, as we shall show, other emotions-both positive and negative-also play an important role in determining the outcomes of contact. The empirical work we present is eclectic in its variety: It includes experimental work in laboratory settings, correlational and longitudinal research in a diversity of field contexts, and studies in more applied domains such as education and acculturation. We conclude with our suggestion as to how these different models might be reconciled, for which Pettigrew's (1998) similar integration provides an instructive comparison. The article is organized into nine sections. The first briefly reviews the research inspired by the Contact Hypothesis. In Section III, we introduce the three developments of Contact Theory that occurred in the 1980s, including our own model. Sections IV-IX review the empirical research instigated by the Hewstone-Brown model. In the final Section, X, we review progress to date and attempt a theoretical integration of these models in the light of the large volume of research that they have stimulated. For convenience of exposition, we have organized the material more or less historically. Our early work in this domain was focused on the processes of stereotype change in the face of disconfirming information, such as might be encountered in a contact situation. This is the subject of Section IV. We then move to experimental studies of contact that have attempted to manipulate intergroup salience directly to test the central hypothesis of the Hewstone-Brown model (Section V), that it is only when some group salience is maintained that one will find the generalized attitude change that is the goal of contact interventions. Necessarily, such laboratory studies are limited in the range of intergroup relationships they can investigate. In Section VI, therefore, we present the results from several correlational studies conducted in a wide range of different cultural contexts. The common theme of these studies was to investigate whether group salience, as experienced and reported by participants, moderates the effects of contact on various indicators of intergroup attitude. In the course of this work, it emerged that an occasional negative by-product of too much salience could be heightened intergroup anxiety, which is usually associated with unfavorable intergroup attitudes, as Stephan and Stephan (1985) had warned some years ago. This finding led to the realization that our original model had rather neglected the affective processes implicated in intergroup contact, an oversight that we addressed in a revised version (Vivian et al., 1997). This instigated a series of studies that investigated the mediating role of anxiety and other emotions in determining the outcome of contact and that also extended the range of outcome measures employed, including measures of affect and implicit attitude. These are presented in Section VII, together with some studies that have simultaneously tested moderation and mediation. In Section VIII, we present research that has attempted to apply the Hewstone-Brown model in educational settings. In Section IX, we discuss work on acculturation of ethnic groups in pluralist societies that links directly to models of intergroup contact. Section X presents our theoretical integration. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This review of the literature on crossed categorization divides studies into those that are relevant to (a) which pattern of evaluation prevails in multiple categorization contexts, (b) what processes best account for the effects, and (c) whether crossed categorization can reduce intergroup bias relative to simple categorization.

In Study 1, cross-group friendship among White elementary school children predicted more positive explicit outgroup attitude toward South Asians, mediated by self-disclosure and intergroup anxiety. In Study 2, cross-group friendship and extended contact among White and South Asian high school students positively predicted explicit outgroup attitude, mediated by self-disclosure and intergroup anxiety. Study 3 replicated these findings in a larger independent sample. In all 3 studies, exposure to the outgroup positively predicted implicit outgroup attitude. Study 4 further showed that self-disclosure improved explicit outgroup attitude via empathy, importance of contact, and intergroup trust. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, which argue for the inclusion of self-disclosure as a key component of social interventions to reduce prejudice. © 2007 American Psychological Association.","cross-group friendship;

The own-race effect has typically been investigated in relation to recognition memory; however, some evidence supports an own-race effect at the level of perceptual encoding in adults. The current study investigated the developmental basis of the own-race effect in White primary students (aged 7-11), secondary students (aged 12-15) and university students. Face stimuli were generated by morphing South Asian and White parent faces together along a linear continuum. In a same/different perceptual discrimination task, participants judged whether the face stimuli (morphs and parent faces) were physically identical to or different from the original parent faces. Results revealed a significant race of face effect for each age group, whereby participants were better at discriminating White relative to Asian faces. A significantly larger own-race effect was observed for the secondary and university students than for primary students. A questionnaire was used to assess other-race social anxiety and contact; however, this self-report measure was not found to be related to the observed own-race effect.

Invariably, these pervasive social problems can be traced back to differences in religion, ethnicity, or countless other bases of group membership: the social categories to which people belong. Social categorization, how we classify ourselves and others, exerts a profound influence on our thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and behaviors. In this volume, Richard Crisp and Miles Hewstone bring together a selection of leading figures in the social sciences to focus on a rapidly emerging, but critically important, new question: how, when, and why do people classify others along multiple dimensions of social categorization? The volume also explores what this means for social behavior, and what implications multiple and complex perceptions of category membership might have for reducing prejudice, discrimination, and social exclusion. Topics covered include: • the cognitive, motivational, and affective implications of multiple categorization • the crossed categorization and common ingroup methods of reducing prejudice and intergroup discrimination • the nature of social categorization among multicultural, multiethnic, and multilingual individuals. Multiple Social Categorization: Process, Models and Applications addresses issues that are central to social psychology and will be of particular interest to those studying or researching in the fields of Group Processes and Intergroup Relations. © 2006 Psychology Press.

The present research yielded complementary evidence that prejudice (toward Muslims in Study 1 and toward South Asians in Study 2) can also predict groups' perceived entitativity. In particular, Study 1 found that the relationships of two predictors, intergroup contact and social dominance orientation, with perceived entitativity were mediated by prejudice. Study 2 demonstrated, as predicted, that this set of relationships occurred primarily for intergroup attitudes of relatively high certainty. Neither study found support for models in which entitativity mediated the relationships of the predictors with prejudice. Conceptual and analytical factors that may account for evidence of the potential bi-directionality of the bias-entitativity relationship are considered. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In post-conflict reconciliation, intergroup forgiveness may play a crucial role in helping groups in conflict put the atrocities of the past behind them (Cairns, Tam, Hewstone, and Niens, 2005). Two studies showed that both the specific intergroup emotion of anger and infrahumanization (the attribution of more human emotions to the ingroup than to the outgroup) predicted decreased intergroup forgiveness in Northern Ireland. Results further revealed intergroup contact as a potential means of reducing anger toward the outgroup and improving attitudes toward them. This research integrated prior interpersonal theory with intergroup literature to examine the concept of intergroup forgiveness and its predictors. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for reconciliation in conflict societies.

Within these groups pressures exist which encourage the individual to comply with the group's viewpoint. This influence, which creates social conformity, is known as 'majority influence' and is the dominant process of social control. However, there also exists a 'minority influence', which emerges from a small subsection of the group and is a dynamic force for social change. Minority Influence and Innovation seeks to identify the conditions under which minority influence can prevail, to change established norms, stimulate original thinking and help us to see the world in new ways. With chapters written by a range of expert contributors, areas of discussion include: • processes and theoretical issues • the factors which affect majority and minority influence • interactions between majority and minority group members This book offers a thorough evaluation of the most important current developments within this field and presents consideration of the issues that will be at the forefront of future research. As such it will be of interest to theorists and practitioners working in social psychology. © 2010 Psychology Press.

Specifically, we predicted that people would perceive (1) greater relative out group homogeneity and (2) greater general intragroup variability on ingroup negative and outgroup positive traits. We confirmed the outgroup homogeneity prediction in a minimal group experiment (N = 80) and a gender group experiment (N = 164). In a second gender group experiment (N = 137), we found that ingroup size moderated this effect: only minority group members showed the predicted pattern of outgroup homogeneity. Evidence for the general intragroup variability prediction was less conclusive. We discuss the results in terms of variability strategies.

The hypothesis suggests that contact with an out-group member has more influence on attitudes toward the out-group when group memberships are salient. In Study 1, the predicted link was found but only for grandparents with whom the grandchild had more frequent contact. The second study examined only the most frequent grandparent relationship and replicated the effect. This study also investigated the role of various mediators of the link between quality of contact and attitudes, as well as quality of contact and perceived out-group variability. Perspective taking, anxiety, and accommodation mediated the effects of contact on attitudes, whereas individuation and self-disclosure mediated the effects of contact on perceived out-group variability. Moderated mediational analysis indicated that the moderating effect of group salience occurs between quality of contact and the mediator, not between the mediator and attitudes. © 2005 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Ageism;

In this chapter we review research on two types of cross-group friendship. Direct cross-group friendship refers to friendships that develop between members of different groups. Extended cross-group friendship, on the other hand, refers to vicarious experience of cross-group friendship, the mere knowledge that other ingroup members have cross-group friends. We consider the relationship between both types of cross-group friendship and prejudice and the processes that mediate and moderate these relationships. The research highlights the respective strengths and weaknesses of direct and extended cross-group friendship and illustrates how they might be practically combined in efforts to improve intergroup relations. © 2007, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Direct contact; Extended contact; Intergroup anxiety; Norms; Prejudice; Segregation; Self-disclosure","","","","","","Russell Sage Foundation, RSF; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Arts Council of Northern Ireland","Correspondence should be addressed to Rhiannon Turner, The Institute of Psychological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.

A multi-tiered approach was used to identify face-specific stages of processing, to test for effects of race-of-face upon processing at these stages and to evaluate the impact of social contact and individuating experience upon these effects. The results showed that race-of-face has significant effects upon face processing, starting from early perceptual stages of structural encoding, and that social factors may play an important role in mediating these effects. © The Author (2007).

Further empirical investigation using standardized measures, structural equation models and including additional mediating/moderating variables is needed. Two studies were thus conducted, one in the Netherlands, and one in the UK. Homesickness was investigated among recent-intake students, using a newly developed instrument, the Utrecht Homesickness Scale. Variables investigated in relationship to homesickness included depression, personality factors (self-liking, competence, self-esteem) and family situation (attachment to family). Homesickness was found to be a common though differentially prevalent phenomenon (approximately 50% in the Netherlands; 80% in the UK). Structural equation models showed that students missed family and friends and had difficulties adjusting to college life. These difficulties were associated with ruminations about home and loneliness, which themselves were associated with depression. There were differences in intensity (UK students were more homesick) and there were gender differences (UK females experienced more homesickness). Both the personality and family situation factors had an impact on homesickness. The results supported the conceptualization of homesickness as a 'mini-grief', to be viewed from theoretical perspectives in the field of loss and bereavement.","","Adult; Analysis of Variance; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Emotions; Family Relations; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Models, Psychological; Netherlands; Personality; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Self Concept; Students; Time Factors; adult; analysis of variance; article; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; depression; emotion; family relation; female; human; loneliness; male; Netherlands; personality; physiology; psychological aspect; psychological model; questionnaire; risk factor; self concept; student; time; United Kingdom","","","","","","","Archer J., The Nature of Grief: The Evolution and Psychology of Reactions to Loss, (1999); Archer J., Ireland J., Amos S., Broad H., Currid L., Derivation of a homesickness scale, British Journal of Psychology, 89, pp. 205-221, (1998); Arrindell W.A., Ettema J.H.M., SCL-90 Handleiding bij een Multidimensionele Psychopathologie-indicator [Guide to a Multidimensional Indicator of Psychopathology], (1975); Baier M., Welch M., An analysis of the concept of homesickness, Archives of Psychiatric Nursing, 6, pp. 54-60, (1992); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Beck A.T., Ward C.H., Mendelson M., Mock J.E., Erbaugh J., An inventory for measuring depression, Archives of General Psychiatry, 4, pp. 561-571, (1961); Bowlby J., Attachment and Loss: Vol. 3.

Experiment 1 examined the effect of consensus expressed by descriptive adjectives (large vs. small) on social influence. A large source resulted in more influence than a small source, irrespective of source status (majority vs. minority). Experiment 2 showed that large sources affected attitudes heuristically, whereas only a small minority instigated systematic processing of the message. Experiment 3 manipulated the type of consensus information, either in terms of descriptive adjectives (large, small) or percentages (82%, 18%, 52%, 48%). When consensus was expressed in terms of descriptive adjectives, the findings of Experiments 1 and 2 were replicated (large sources were more influential than small sources), but when consensus was expressed in terms of percentages, the majority was more influential than the minority, irrespective of group consensus. © 2005 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Group consensus;

This study examined intergroup forgiveness among 340 young adults in Northern Ireland. A short form of the Enright Forgiveness Inventory explored possible influences on propensity to forgive. All participants were Catholic and female (mean age 17.36 years), and had experienced verbal or physical injury or bereavement due to the Northern Irish political violence. Overall forgiveness levels were low in comparison with previous studies of interpersonal forgiveness but similar to previous studies of intergroup forgiveness in Northern Ireland. The strongest (negative) predictor of forgiveness was the perceived degree of hurt caused by the injury. © 2004 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.","","Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Ireland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World; injury; public attitude; social behavior; social conflict","","","","","","","Azar F., Mullet E., Vinconneau G., The propensity to forgive: Findings from Lebanon, Journal for Peace Research, 36, 2, pp. 169-181, (1999); Brooks C., Rumination As a Mediator of Forgiveness and Depression: Differences Based on Gender and State-trait Levels of Analysis, (2003); Brown R., Turner J.C., Individual-level evidence for the causes and consequences of social capital, American Journal of Political Science, 41, pp. 999-1023, (1981); Cairns E., Darby J., The conflict in Northern Ireland: Causes, consequences and controls, American Psychologist, 53, 7, pp. 754-760, (1998); Cairns E., Hewstone M., McLernon F., Lewis C.A., Correlates of Inter-Group Forgiveness in Northern Ireland, (2002); Clinton W., (1998); Couper D., Forgiveness in the community: Views from an Episcopal priest and former chief of police, Exploring Forgiveness, pp. 139-161, (1998); Duff A., Marshall S., Dobash R.A., Dobash R.P., Penal Theory and Practice: Tradition and Innovation in Criminal Justice, (1994); Enright R.D., Coyle C.T., Researching the process model of forgiveness with psychological interventions, Dimensions of Forgiveness, pp. 139-162, (1994); Enright R., The moral development of forgiveness, Handbook of Moral Behavior and Development, 1, pp. 123-151, (1991); Enright R.D., Santos M.J., Al-Mabuk R., The adolescent as forgiver, Journal of Adolescence, 12, pp. 95-110, (1989); New Pathways: Developing a Peace Process in Northern Ireland, (1997); Fitzgibbons R.P., The cognitive and emotional uses of forgiveness in the treatment of anger, Psychotherapy, 23, pp. 629-633, (1986); Girard M., Mullet E., Forgiveness in adolescents, young, middle-aged and older adults, Journal of Adult Development, 4, 4, pp. 209-220, (1997); Gold G.J., Weiner B., Remorse, confession, group identity, and expectancies about repeating a transgression, Basic and Applied Psychology, 22, 4, pp. 291-300, (2000); Gorsuch R.L., Hao J.Y., Forgiveness: An exploratory factor analysis and its relationships to religious variables, Review of Religious Research, 34, pp. 333-347, (1993); Graef R., Why Restorative Justice?

Rothbart and B. Park (1986) demonstrated that, consistent with the common negativity bias, positive traits are difficult to confirm and easy to disconfirm, whereas the opposite is true for negative traits. This article extends their analysis by showing that trait (dis-)confirmability is moderated by trait content (warmth vs. competence). Study 1 identifies a trait sample representative of warmth and competence. Study 2 shows a strong negativity effect for warmth and a reduced (or absent) negativity effect for competence. Study 3 examines trait properties related to the behavioral range of the trait possessor and to the motivational goals of the perceiver as predictors of trait (dis-)confirmability. The theoretical and practical implications of the authors' findings are discussed, and avenues for future research are suggested.

In Study 1, the authors tested the effects of cross-group friendships with gay men on out-group attitudes, meta-attitudinal strength, and attitude accessibility. The authors simultaneously explored mediational effects of intergroup anxiety. Path analysis showed that cross-group friendships were associated with meta-attitudinally stronger and more accessible out-group attitudes, and the effects on all 3 criterion variables were mediated by intergroup anxiety. In Study 2, the authors sought to replicate the basic results of Study 1, while additionally exploring mediational effects of closeness of cross-group friendship and moderational effects of perceived group typicality. Structural equation modeling showed that cross-group friendships were associated with meta-attitudinally stronger and more accessible out-group attitudes; friendships had indirect effects on all 3 criterion variables, via closeness of friendship and intergroup anxiety. Closeness of friendship only predicted lower intergroup anxiety, however, when the out-group friend was perceived as highly typical. The authors emphasize the importance of considering the nature of out-group attitudes more completely when evaluating the effectiveness of intergroup contact in reducing prejudice.

This agreement received the support of 71% of the Northern Irish electorate in a referendum which in turn led to the setting up of a local assembly and a power-sharing government, embracing all the major political parties. (The assembly has collapsed at the time of writing this chapter; however, there are strong hopes that it will soon be restored.) One of many aims of the Good Friday Agreement was to create an “inclusive society” (Robinson, 2003); a society that would turn its back on sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants, and in which people would “firmly dedicate ourselves to the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust, and to the protection and vindication of the human rights of all.” (Article 2 of The Agreement). In this chapter we will focus specifically on exclusion in the form of the religious segregation that lies at the heart of Northern Irish society and, we argue, its problems. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Books, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Aron A., Aron E.N., Norman C., Self-expansion model of motivation and cognition in close relationships and beyond, Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Interpersonal Processes, pp. 478-501, (2001); Baron R., Kenny D.A., The moderator–mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Batson C.D., Sager K., Garst E., Kang M., Rubchinsky K., Dawson K., Is empathy-induced helping due to self-other merging?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, pp. 495-509, (1997); Boal F.W., Territoriality on the Shankhill-Falls divide, Belfast, Irish Geography, 6, pp. 30-50, (1969); Boal F.W., Murray C.R., Poole M.A., Belfast: The urban encapsulation of a national conflict, Urban Ethnic Conflict: A Comparative Perspective (Comparative Urban Studies Monograph, 3, pp. 77-13, (1976); Boal F.W., Keane M.C., Livingstone D.N., Them and Us?

In all experiments two levels of consensus difference were examined; large (82% versus 18%) and small (52% versus 48%). Experiment 1 showed that a majority source had more influence than a minority source, irrespective of consensus level. Experiment 2 examined the cause of this effect by presenting only the source label ('majority' versus 'minority'), only the consensus information (percentages) or both. The superior influence of the majority was again found when either (a) both source label and consensus information were given (replicating Experiment 1) and (b) only consensus information was given, but not when (c) only the source label was given. The results showed majority influence was due to the consensus information indicating more than 50% of the population supported that position. Experiment 3 also manipulated message quality (strong versus weak arguments) to identify whether systematic processing had occurred. Message quality only had an impact with the minority of 18%. These studies show that consensus information has different effects for majority and minority influence. For majority influence, having over 50% support is sufficient to cause compliance while for a minority there are advantages to being numerically small, in terms of leading to detailed processing of its message.

In the first experiment, when attitudes were changed via minority influence there was a greater likelihood to engage in an attitude-consistent behavioral intention than when attitudes were changed via majority influence. This suggests that minority influence leads to stronger attitudes (based on systematic processing) that are more predictive of behavioral intentions, while attitude change via majority influence is due to compliance through non-systematic processing. Further support for this interpretation comes from the finding that the amount of message-congruent elaboration mediated behavioral intention. When there was no attitude change, there was no impact on behavioral intention to engage in an attitude-consistent behavior. Experiment 2 explored the role of personal relevance of the topic and also included a real behavioral measure. When the topic was of low personal relevance, the same pattern was found as Experiment 1. When the topic was of high personal relevance, thus increasing the motivation to engage in systematic processing, attitudes changed by both a majority and minority source increased behavioral intention and actual behavior. The results are consistent with the view that both majorities and minorities can lead to different processes and consequences under different situations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This paper reports three cross-sectional studies concerning unconditional respect in intergroup relations in three very different contexts. In all three studies, unconditional respect was positively related to positive action tendencies, and negatively related to negative action tendencies, toward other groups. Regression analyses showed that respect was a significant predictor of negative action tendencies even when attitude to the other group, social dominance orientation, empathy, and the quality and quantity of intergroup contact were statistically controlled. Moderation analyses showed that respect was particularly important under conditions of high threat. The implications of unconditional respect for intergroup relations are discussed.

We found that both group size and gender had consistent effects on perceived out-group variability, even when potentially confounded alternative explanations were assessed. Men showed a stronger out-group homogeneity effect than women, except when women were in the majority (Studies One and Two), and women showed no in-group homogeneity effect. There was an association between out-group homogeneity and the tendency to generate more subgroups for the in-group than out-group (Study Two), but perceived variability was not associated with familiarity, distinctiveness, perceived group size, or perceived group status. These consistent effects qualify the conclusions of prior research in important ways, and cannot be explained in terms of differences in stereotype accuracy (Study Three), or a confound between the gender majority of a major and its perceived status (Study Four). We discuss our findings in terms of theoretical explanations for gender and size effects on out-group homogeneity, and methodological considerations.","","","","","","","","","Allmendinger J., Richard Hackman J., The More the Better?

We examined the role of grandparent-grandchild communication (in terms of self-disclosure) and its relations to anxiety and empathy in improving intergenerational attitudes. Analyses revealed that: (1) quantity and quality of contact with older people (other than grandparents) predict higher levels of self-disclosure (to one's grandparent); (2) quantity (but not quality) of contact with older people is associated with more favorable implicit associations with them, while quality of contact is associated with more favorable explicit attitudes; and (3) higher levels of self-disclosure to grandparents are associated with empathy and reduced anxiety, which in turn are associated with more positive explicit attitudes toward older adults. We explain our findings in light of the environmental associations model (Karpinsky & Hilton, 2001) - that quantity of contact, or mere exposure to older people, drives the Implicit Association Test effect. The model sheds light on the mediational roles of interpersonal variables (self-disclosure, anxiety, and empathy with a grandparent) in intergenerational contact.

A variety of alternative theoretical models have been proposed and examined in earlier research. The present study differs from those reported previously in that it focused on correlated social categorizations. Moreover it employed a large and broadly representative sample. This permitted us to examine the various theoretical models with considerable power. Results supported a largely additive model, in which out-group categorizations independently contributed to out-group derogation. Additionally, a number of weaker category interactions suggested that in-group membership on one dimension was of greater importance if the target person was an in-group member on other categorizations as well. Finally, somewhat different effects were found for the two dependent variables employed, liking and perceived similarity. Results are more in accordance with social identity theory and the similarity-attraction hypothesis than with Doise's category differentiation model. © 2000, Sage Publications.

Three correlational studies (Ns = 338, 141, and 798) tested the moderating role of the affective-cognitive bases of prejudice, assessing whether the size of the friendship- prejudice relationship depends on the extent to which emotions (vs. thoughts) are relevant to the prejudiced attitudes at stake. In Study 1, direct friendship effects were larger with outgroups generating stronger affective responding than with outgroups generating stronger cognitive responding, whereas indirect friendship effects were larger with cognitive than with affective outgroups. Study 2 detected a similar pattern but with prejudice basis assessed in terms of individual differences. Study 3 replicated Study 2's indirect friendship-cognitive basis moderation in a context of historically polarized intergroup relations and on two new outcome variables, intergroup trust and negative action tendencies. © 2007 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Action tendencies; Affect; Attitude structure; Friendship; Northern Ireland; Trust","","","","","","","","Boivin J., Statistical notes on preparing data for univariate and multivariate analyses, Research Bulletin (CRDH), 12, 15, pp. 1-16, (1994); Brown R., Hewstone M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, pp. 255-343, (2005); Cairns E., Hewstone M., Northern Ireland: In-group pride and out-group prejudice, Seven Deadly Sins: A New Look at Society Through An Old Lens, pp. 8-12, (2005); Dovidio J.F., Brigham J.C., Johnson B.T., Gaertner S.L., Stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination: Another look, Stereotypes and Stereotyping, pp. 276-319, (1996); Edwards K., Hippel W., Hearts and mind: The priority of affective versus cognitive factors in person perception, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, pp. 996-1011, (1995); Eller A., Abrams D., Gringos"" in Mexico: Cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of language school-promoted contact on intergroup bias, Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 6, pp. 55-75, (2003); Esses V.M., Dovidio J.F., The role of emotions in determining willingness to engage in intergroup contact, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, pp. 1202-1214, (2002); Esses V.M., Maio G.R., Expanding the assessment of attitude components and structure: The advantages of open-ended measures, European Review of Social Psychology, pp. 71-102, (2002); Gallagher A.M., The approach of government: Community relations and equity, Facets of the Conflict in Northern Ireland, pp. 27-43, (1995); Haddock G., Zanna M.P., Esses V.M., Assessing the structure of prejudicial attitudes: The case of attitudes toward homosexuals, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, pp. 1105-1118, (1993); Hewstone M., Cairns E., Voci A., Paolini S., McLernon F., Crisp R., Intergroup contact in a divided society: Challenging segregation in Northern Ireland, The Social Psychology of Inclusion and Exclusion, pp. 265-292, (2005); Huskinson T.L.H., Haddock G., Individual differences in attitude structure: Variance in the chronic reliance on affective and cognitive information, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 40, pp. 82-90, (2004); Huskinson T.L.H., Haddock G., Individual differences in attitude structure and the accessibility of the affective and cognitive components of attitude, Social Cognition, 24, pp. 453-468, (2006); Kollock P., The emergence of exchange structures: An experimental study of uncertainty, commitment, and trust, American Journal of Sociology, 100, pp. 313-345, (1994); Levin S., Laar C., Sidanius J., The effects of ingroup and outgroup friendships on ethnic attitudes in college: A longitudinal study, Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 6, pp. 76-92, (2003); MacKie D.M., Devos T., Smith E.R., Intergroup emotions: Explaining offensive action tendencies in an intergroup context, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, pp. 602-616, (2000); McClelland G.H., Judd C.M., The statistical difficulties of detecting interactions and moderator effects, Psychological Bulletin, 114, pp. 376-390, (1993); Niens U., Cairns E., Hewstone M., Contact and conflict in Northern Ireland, Researching the Troubles: Social Science Perspectives on the Northern Ireland Conflict, pp. 123-140, (2003); Paolini S., Hewstone M., Cairns E., Voci A., Effects of direct and indirect cross-group friendships on judgments of Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland: The mediating role of an anxiety-reduction mechanism, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 30, pp. 770-786, (2004); Paolini S., Hewstone M., Voci A., Harwood J., Cairns E., Intergroup contact and the promotion of intergroup harmony: The influence of intergroup emotions, Social Identities: Motivational, Emotional, and Cultural Influences, pp. 209-238, (2006); Pettigrew T.F., Generalized intergroup contact effects on prejudice, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, pp. 173-185, (1997); Pettigrew T.F., Intergroup contact theory.

Two surveys of cross-community relationships in Northern Ireland, using a student sample (N - 341) and a representative sample of the general population (N = 735), tested whether (a) direct and indirect friendships had generalized effects on both prejudice and perceived outgroup variability and (b) reduced anxiety about future encounters with outgroup members mediated such relationships. Structural equation modeling confirmed that, in both samples, direct and indirect cross-group friendships between Catholics and Protestants were associated with reduced prejudice toward the religious outgroup and increased perceived outgroup variability, via an anxiety-reduction mechanism. It is argued that emerging generalization hypotheses help to integrate both cognition and affect and interpersonal and intergroup approaches to contact.","Anxiety; Contact hypothesis; Friendship; Generalization; Group variability","","","","","","","","Agger I., Psychosocial assistance during ethnopolitical warfare in the former Yugoslavia, Ethnopolitical Warfare: Causes, Consequences, and Possible Solutions, pp. 305-318, (2001); Amir Y., The role of intergroup contact in change of prejudice and race relations, Towards the Elimination of Racism, pp. 245-280, (1976); Ashton N.L., Shaw M.E., Worsham A.P., Affective reactions to interpersonal distance by friends and strangers, Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 15, pp. 306-308, (1980); Bagozzi R.P., Heatherton T.F., A general approach to representing multifaceted personality constructs: Application to state self-esteem, Structural Equation Modeling, 1, pp. 35-67, (1994); Batson C.D., Polycarpou P., Harmon-Jones E., Imhoff H.J., Mitchener E.C., Bednar L.L., Et al., Empathy and attitudes: Can feelings for a member of a stigmatised group improve feelings toward the group?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 105-118, (1997); Brewer M.B., Miller N., Beyond the contact hypothesis: Theoretical perspectives on desegregation, Groups in Contact: The Psychology of Desegregation, pp. 281-302, (1984); Brewer M.B., Miller N., Contact and cooperation: When do they work?, Eliminating Racism: Profiles in Controversy, pp. 315-326, (1988); Brown R., Turner J.C., Interpersonal and intergroup behavior, Intergroup Behavior, pp. 33-65, (1981); Brown R., Vivian J., Hewstone M., Changing attitudes through intergroup contact: The effects of group membership salience, European Journal of Social Psychology, 29, pp. 741-764, (1999); Cairns E., Darby J., The conflict in Northern Ireland: Causes, consequences, and controls, American Psychologist, 53, pp. 754-760, (1998); Cohen S., Sherrod D.R., Clark M.S., Social skills and the stress-protective role of social support, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50, pp. 963-973, (1986); Deschamps J.-C., Devos T., Regarding the relationship between social identity and personal identity, Social Identity: International Perspectives, pp. 1-12, (1998); DuBois D., Hirsch B., School and neighbourhood friendship patterns of Blacks and Whites in early adolescence, Child Development, 61, pp. 524-536, (1990); Eastbrook J.A., The effect of emotion on cue utilization and the organization of behavior, Psychological Review, 66, pp. 183-201, (1959); Ellison C.G., Powers D.A., The contact hypothesis and racial attitudes among Black Americans, Social Science Quarterly, 75, pp. 385-400, (1994); Gaertner S.L., Dovidio J.F., Anastasio P.A., Bachman B.A., Rust M.C., The common ingroup identity model: Recategorization and the reduction of intergroup bias, European Review of Social Psychology, 4, pp. 1-26, (1993); Garcia-Marques L., Mackie D.M., The impact of stereotype incongruent information on perceived group variability and stereotype change, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77, pp. 979-990, (1999); Haddock G., Zanna M.P., Esses V.M., Assessing the structure of prejudicial attitudes: The case of attitudes toward homosexuals, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, pp. 1105-1118, (1993); Hallinan M.T., Classroom racial composition and children's friendships, Social Forces, 61, pp. 56-72, (1982); Hallinan M.T., Teixeira R.A., Students' interracial friendships: Individual characteristics, structural effects and racial differences, American Journal of Education, 95, pp. 563-583, (1987); Hamberger J., Hewstone M., Inter-ethnic contact as a predictor of blatant and subtle prejudice: Tests of a model in four West European nations, British Journal of Social Psychology, 36, pp. 173-190, (1997); Hamilton D.L., Bishop G.D., Attitudinal and behavioral effects of initial integration of White suburban neighborhoods, Journal of Social Issues, 32, pp. 47-67, (1976); Haslam S.A., McGarty C., Turner J.C., Salient group membership and persuasion: The role of social identity in the validation of beliefs, What Is Social about Social Cognition?

This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis comparing the effects of crossed categorization on intergroup evaluations with the effects of simple categorization on intergroup evaluations. The crossed categorization paradigm is shown to increase or decrease ingroup bias, depending on how ingroup bias is defined in the crossed categorization paradigm. Moreover, just as in simple categorization, ingroup bias in crossed categorization is shown to be greater when the proportionate size of the ingroup is smaller. However, contrary to the patterns established in simple categorization, the reality of the group categorizations does not increase ingroup bias in crossed categorization. We discuss the implications of these results for future research on intergroup evaluations.

Utilizing a bogus 'newspaper story' paradigm, we explored whether participants would differentially recall target attributes as a function of two dimensions of category membership. Findings from this recall measure suggested that information concerning ingroup and outgroup members was processed as an interactive function of both religion and gender intergroup dimensions. Religion was only used to guide processing of more specific information if the story character was also an outgroup member on the gender dimension. These findings suggest a complex pattern of intergroup representation in the processing of group-relevant information in the Northern Irish context.","","Adult; Analysis of Variance; Female; Humans; Mental Recall;

Specifically the study focused on the psychological impact of the ethnopolitical conflict in Northern Ireland, utilizing people's identification with either the Catholic or Protestant community. Our results revealed that intergroup forgiveness mediated the relationship between both victimhood and group identification, as predictors, and mild psychiatric morbidity. Collective guilt, on the other hand, mediated the relationship between both exposure to violence and group identification, as predictors, and intergroup forgiveness. Overall this study shows that forgiveness and collective guilt can act as mediators in the relationship between impact of ethnopolitical conflict and mental health, at the group level, and thus demonstrates their centrality to the reconciliation process. Implications for intergroup reconciliation initiatives in Northern Ireland are discussed. © 2009 International Society of Political Psychology.","Collective guilt; Group identity; Intergroup forgiveness; Mild psychiatric morbidity; Reconciliation; Victimhood","","","","","","","","Allan A., Allan M.M., Kaminer D., Stein D.J., Exploration of the association between apology and forgiveness amongst victims of human rights violations, Behavioural Sciences and the Law, 24, pp. 87-102, (2006); Amstutz M.R., The Healing of Nations: The Promise and Limits of Political Forgiveness., (2005); Arbuckle J.L., Amos User's Guide: Version 6.0., (2005); Azar F., Mullet E., Vinsonneau G., The propensity to forgive, findings from Lebanon, Journal of Peace Research, 36, pp. 169-181, (1999); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Branscombe N.R., A social psychology perspective on collective guilt, Collective Guilt: International Perspectives, pp. 320-334, (2004); Branscombe N.R., Slugoski B., Kappen D.M., The measurement of collective guilt: What it is and what it is not, Collective Guilt: International Perspectives, pp. 16-34, (2004); Brown R., Condor S., Mathews A., Wade G., Williams J., Explaining intergroup differentiation in an industrial organization, Journal of Occupational Psychology, 59, pp. 273-286, (1986); Cairns E., Hewstone M., Niens U., Tam T., Intergroup forgiveness and intergroup conflict: Northern Ireland, A case study, Handbook of Forgiveness, pp. 461-476, (2005); Cairns E., Mallet J., Lewis C., Wilson R., Who Are the Victims?

The studies tested the hypothesis that the strength of group-identification moderates the importance of individual- vs. group-level threats as predictors of attitudes and trust and as mediators of contact effects. Both anxiety and symbolic threat, but not realistic threat, emerged as predictors of the criterion variables and mediated contact effects. Our results provide support for the moderating role of identification and suggest that while symbolic threat predicts attitudes and trust for high, but not low identifiers, anxiety is a somewhat more important predictor for low than for high identifiers. We discuss these results against the background of current intergroup relations in Northern Ireland. © 2007 The British Psychological Society.","","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety;

In both experiments participants' attitudes were measured after being exposed to two messages, delayed in time, which argued opposite positions (initial message and counter-message). In the first experiment, attitudes following minority endorsement of the initial message were more resistant to a second counter-message only when the initial message contained strong versus weak arguments. Attitudes changed following majority influence did not resist the second counter-message and returned to their pre-test level. Experiment 2 varied whether memory was warned (i.e., message recipients expected to recall the message) or not, to manipulate message processing. When memory was warned, which should increase message processing, attitudes changed following both majority and minority influence resisted the second counter-message. The results support the view that minority influence instigates systematic processing of its arguments, leading to attitudes that resist counter-persuasion. Attitudes formed following majority influence yield to counter-persuasion unless there is a secondary task that encourages message processing.

The chapter reviews the major theories of majority and minority influence with reference to which source condition is associated with most message processing (and where relevant, the contexts under which this occurs) and experimental research examining these predictions. The chapter then presents a new theoretical model (the source-context-elaboration model, SCEM) that aims to integrate the disparate research findings. The model specifies the processes underlying majority and minority influence, the contexts under which these processes occur and the consequences for attitudes changed by majority and minority influence. The chapter then describes a series of experiments that address each of the aspects of the theoretical model. Finally, a range of research-related issues are discussed and future issues for the research area as a whole are considered. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Pioneers such as Lewin, Asch, Kelley and Festinger began groundwork in the 1940s and 1950s, but it was only in the late 1960s that social psychology came of age. Since then it has blossomed, both in investigating the basics of the discipline and in applying the insights from fundamental social psychology to different fields related to the area. This volume is devoted to the development of understanding in the field of social psychology over the last four decades, focusing on both basic and applied social psychology. Contributions are gathered under five main areas: attitudes and attitude change; social cognition and emotions; interpersonal and group processes; health behavior; and bereavement and coping. These five domains not only illustrate the scope of social psychology, but also pay tribute to one of the key figures in modern social psychology, Wolfgang Stroebe. Remarkably, he has made significant contributions across all five of these areas, and his research achievements exemplify the progress, prospects and problems faced by modern social psychology over the last 40 years. This volume includes contributions from some of the most distinguished names in the field, and all authors provide an overview or critical look at their specific area of expertise, tracing historical developments where appropriate. The Scope of Social Psychology provides a broad-ranging, illustrative review of the field of modern social psychology. © 2007 Psychology Press.

Independent judges, blind to experimental conditions, rated participants ' written arguments. In Studies 1 and 2, we found that participants assigned to a numerical minority generated more original arguments when advocating their own position than did numerical majorities. In Study 3, an equal-factions control group was included in the design, and all participants were instructed to argue for a counter-attitudinal position. Those in the numerical minority generated more creative arguments than those in both the majority and equal-factions conditions, but not stronger arguments. We propose cognitive and social processes that may underlie our obtained effects and discuss implications for minority influence research.

Illusory correlations between the desirability of behaviours and two dimensions of social categorization, both containing a majority and a minority category, were assessed in single categorization and crossed categorization conditions. In the single categorization conditions, the usual illusory correlation in favour of the majority category was obtained. In the crossed condition, the combination of the two majority categories was positively discriminated from the remaining three combinations, while no differences were found among the latter. A source-monitoring analysis of assignment frequencies replicated earlier findings that illusory correlations are due to an evaluative guessing bias, rather than to enhanced memory for individual instances of behaviour. The results show inconsistencies with a distinctiveness-based and a social categorization account of illusory correlations, but they can be explained in terms of information loss.

In Experiment 1, the typical additive pattern of evaluation across artificial crossed category groups became a social inclusion pattern in a common ingroup context. In Experiment 2, the authors manipulated the importance of real crossed category targets. When the crossed groups were of low importance, the effects of imposing a common ingroup replicated those observed in Experiment 1. For important crossed groups, however, the additive pattern remained. In Experiment 3, the authors measured perceived importance of the crossed groups to social identity prior to introducing a common ingroup context. The effects of a common categorization on evaluations were again moderated by perceived importance. These findings are discussed in the context of integrating crossed categorization and common ingroup identity models of multiple categorization. © 2006 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Common ingroup identity;

In Study 1 (N = 310 students) contact had direct positive effects on perceived out-group variability and out-group attitude, and a direct negative effect on subtle prejudice; the last two effects were mediated by intergroup anxiety. Contact also had a greater effect on reduced anxiety and improved out-group perception and evaluation when group salience was high. In Study 2 (N = 94 hospital workers) contact at work had direct effects on out-group attitudes and rights for immigrants, and an effect on attitudes toward ethnic coworkers that was mediated by intergroup anxiety at work. The effects of contact were again moderated by group salience. These findings show that the combination of positive contact with individuals from the out-group and group salience is effective in improving intergroup relations, and often does so via reduced anxiety. © 2003, Sage Publications.

Experiment 1 established the baseline conditions under which differential evaluation of crossed category groups occurs. Experiment 2 extended these conditions to more complex affectively toned contexts, demonstrating the moderating effect of performance feedback on evaluations; the additive pattern found under neutral feedback conditions gave way to an equivalence pattern when participants received positive performance feedback, and this reduction in bias was mediated by participants' self-reported affective state. In both experiments category differentiation occurred irrespective of different intergroup or feedback conditions, suggesting that cognitive processes underlying the representation of the intergroup structure remain constant in different contexts.

Crossed categorisation is the logical extension to theorising and research in this domain in its description and explanation of the processes and outcomes that occur when two or more dimensions of group membership become simultaneously salient or accessible. Building on previous theoretical, empirical, and meta-analytical work, we propose an integrative model of crossed categorisation effects. Adopting a ""dual-route"" perspective, we suggest that moderators of crossed category evaluations will produce specifiable outcome patterns via two mediational routes: affective and cognitive. We review recent empirical work within the framework of this model, finding general support for the proposed processes. Finally, we suggest refinements and outline possibilities and implications for the model and future work into crossed categorisation, intergroup relations, and social discrimination. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (SBR 931 9752); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (R00429534071); British Academy, (R000239382, SG-31041)","Address correspondence to: RJ Crisp, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK, Email: r.crisp@bham.ac.uk Preparation of this review was supported by an Economic and Social Research Council doctoral studentship (R00429534071) and British Academy (SG-31041) grant to R.

In particular, we consider the opportunity to distinguish between direct and indirect contact, the possibility of a bi-directional relation between contact and prejudice, the mediating and moderating processes involved in this relation, and the different possible outcomes of intergroup contact, such as explicit and implicit attitudes, affective reconciliation and physiological states. Finally, we review some of the major critiques to the contact hypothesis, trying to provide adequate responses, and we discuss the practical applications of intergroup contact in modern societies.","Intergroup Contact;

In Experiment 1, participants' attitudes were measured after being exposed to two messages which argued opposite positions (initial pro-attitudinal message and subsequent, counter-attitudinal counter-message). Attitudes following minority endorsement of the initial message were more resistant to a (second) counter-message than attitudes following majority endorsement of the initial message. Experiment 2 replicated this finding when the message direction was reversed (counter-attitudinal initial message and pro-attitudinal counter-message) and showed that the level of message elaboration mediated the amount of attitude resistance. Experiment 3 included conditions where participants received only the counter-message and showed that minority-source participants had resisted the second message (counter-message) rather than being influenced by it. These results show that minority influence induces systematic processing of its arguments which leads to attitudes which are resistant to counter-persuasion. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Both experiments crossed source status (majority vs. minority) with message quality (strong vs. weak arguments). In each experiment, message elaboration was manipulated by varying either motivational (outcome relevance, Experiment 1) or cognitive (orientating tasks, Experiment 2) factors. The results showed that when either motivational or cognitive factors encouraged low message elaboration, there was heuristic acceptance of the majority position without detailed message processing. When the level of message elaboration was intermediate, there was message processing only for the minority source. Finally, when message elaboration was high, there was message processing for both source conditions. These results show that majority and minority influence is sensitive to motivational and cognitive factors that constrain or enhance message elaboration and that both sources can lead to systematic processing under specific circumstances. © 2007 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Attitude change; Cognitive and motivational tasks; Majority influence; Message elaboration; Minority influence; Social influence","Adult; Attitude; Cognition; Culture; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Minority Groups; Motivation; Periodicity; Pilot Projects; Questionnaires; adult; article; attitude; cognition; cultural anthropology; ethnology; female; human; human relation; male; minority group; motivation; periodicity; pilot study; questionnaire","","","","","","","Baker S.M., Petty R.E., Majority and minority influence: Source-position imbalance as a determinant of message scrutiny, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, pp. 5-19, (1994); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Bohner G., Frank S., Erb H.P., Heuristic processing of distinctiveness information in minority and majority influence, European Journal of Social Psychology, 28, pp. 855-860, (1998); Bohner G., Moskowitz G., Chaiken S., The interplay of heuristic and systematic processing of social information, European Review of Social Psychology, 6, pp. 33-68, (1995); Craik F.I.M., Lockhart R.S., Levels of processing: A framework for memory research, Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 11, pp. 671-684, (1972); Crano W.D., Alvaro E.M., The context/comparison model of social influence: Mechanisms, structure, and linkages that underlie indirect attitude change, European Review of Social Psychology, pp. 175-202, (1998); Crano W.D., Chen X., The leniency contract and persistence of majority and minority influence, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, pp. 1437-1450, (1998); David B., Turner J.C., Majority and minority influence: A single process self-categorization analysis, Group Consensus and Innovation, pp. 91-121, (2001); De Dreu C.K.W., De Vries N.K., Numerical support, information processing and attitude change, European Journal of Social Psychology, 23, pp. 647-663, (1993); De Dreu C.K.W., De Vries N.K., Differential processing and attitude change following majority and minority arguments, British Journal of Social Psychology, 35, pp. 77-90, (1996); De Dreu C.K.W., De Vries N.K., Gordijn E., Schuurman M., Convergent and divergent processing of majority and minority arguments: Effects on focal and related attitudes, European Journal of Social Psychology, 29, pp. 329-348, (1999); De Vries N.K., De Dreu C.K.W., Gordijn E., Schuurman M., Majority and minority influence: A dual interpretation, European Review of Social Psychology, pp. 145-172, (1996); Eagly A.H., Chaiken S., The Psychology of Attitudes, (1993); Erb H.P., Bohner G., Schmalzle K., Rank S., Beyond conflict and discrepancy: Cognitive bias in minority and majority influence, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 24, pp. 620-633, (1998); Fleming M.A., Petty R.E., White P.H., Stigmatized targets and evaluation: Prejudice as a determinant of attribute scrutiny and polarization, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 496-507, (2005); Gardikiotis A., Martin R., Hewstone M., Group consensus in social influence: Type of consensus information as a moderator of majority and minority influence, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 1163-1174, (2005); Heesacker M., Petty R., Cacioppo J., Field dependence and attitude change: Source credibility can alter persuasion by affecting message-relevant thinking, Journal of Personality, 51, pp. 653-666, (1983); Kerr N., When is a minority a minority?

The studies tested predictions from theoretical accounts of biased group judgments in terms of simplistic reasoning, parallel distributed memory, and pseudocontingencies. Study 1 revealed a positive correlation between erroneous stereotype formation and learning of the true contingencies with the confounding factor. Study 2 showed that a focus manipulation during encoding moderated the correlation between stereotype formation and contingency learning but not the strength of the erroneous stereotype. Study 3 used a quasiexperimental comparison between participants with biased versus unbiased group judgments and extended the findings of a positive relation between stereotype formation and contingency learning. The results support an explanation of biased group judgments by pseudocontingencies; that is, unwarranted inferences from accurately perceived bivariate correlations in complex environments.","","Adult; Analysis of Variance; Association Learning; Cognition; Humans; Judgment; Learning; Memory; Models, Psychological; Peer Group; Predictive Value of Tests; Prejudice; Social Behavior; Social Desirability; Social Perception; Stereotyping; Students; adult; analysis of variance; article; cognition; decision making; human; learning; memory; peer group; perception; physiology; prediction and forecasting; psychological aspect; psychological model; social behavior; social desirability; social psychology; student","","","","","","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Allan L.G., A note on measurement of contingency between two binary variables in judgment tasks, Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 15, pp. 147-149, (1980); Batchelder W.H., Riefer D.M., Multinomial processing models of source monitoring, Psychological Review, 97, pp. 548-564, (1990); Batchelder W.H., Riefer D.M., Theoretical and empirical review of multinomial process tree modeling, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 6, pp. 57-86, (1999); Bayen U.J., Murnane K., Erdfelder E., Source discrimination, item detection, and multinomial models of source monitoring, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 22, pp. 197-215, (1996); Bayen U.J., Nakamura G.V., Dupuis S.E., Yang C.-L., The use of schematic knowledge about sources in source monitoring, Memory & Cognition, 28, pp. 480-500, (2000); Eagly A.H., Steffen V.J., Gender stereotypes stem from the distribution of women and men into social roles, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46, pp. 735-754, (1984); Fairchild H.H., Scientific racism: The cloak of objectivity, Journal of Social Issues, 47, pp. 101-115, (1991); Fiedler K., The tricky nature of skewed frequency tables: An information loss account of distinctiveness-based illusory correlations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, pp. 24-36, (1991); Fiedler K., Explaining and simulating judgment biases as an aggregation phenomenon in probabilistic, multiple-cue environments, Psychological Review, 103, pp. 193-214, (1996); Fiedler K., Beware of samples!

Two studies investigated the impact of group variability on stereotype change. Study 1 crossed pattern of disconfirming information (concentrated/dispersed) with a direct manipulation of the group's perceived variability (high/low); Study 2 crossed pattern with an indirect manipulation of the group's perceived variability (no subgrouping/subgrouping). Both studies yielded a reliable interaction between pattern of stereotype-disconfirming information and perceived group variability. A central-tendency measure of stereotyping (and a measure of dispersion in Study 2) was weaker in the dispersed than concentrated conditions only when variability was low. Disconfirmers were also perceived as more typical in the dispersed than concentrated conditions when variability was low. Mediational analyses showed that the relationship between stereotyping and perceived typicality was bidirectional rather than typicality driving stereotyping. These results may help us to design interventions that achieve multiple types of generalized change in the way outgroups are so often negatively perceived. © 2000 Academic Press.","","","","","","","Cardiff Research Initiative; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","This research was funded, in part, by a grant from the Cardiff Research Initiative awarded to Miles Hewstone, and a Ph.D. studentship from the Economic & Social Research Council awarded to Jürgen Hamberger.

Participants were required to recall specific information from previously encountered bogus newspaper stories. Across two experiments it emerged that participants differentially recalled target attributes as a function of positive versus negative story context and multiple dimensions of group membership. Specifically, different dimensions of categorization were dominant for positive and negative evaluative domains. These findings provide an important qualification to the positive-negative asymmetry effect in intergroup discrimination when multiple dimensions of categorization are available. In addition, comparison of the observed effects in different cultural settings suggests the need to consider contextual influences when considering intergroup phenomena with real social group memberships. Finally, in line with previous work, a dissociation was observed between explicit and implicit measures of intergroup bias. The findings are considered within the wider context of work into social categorization and intergroup relations.

Box 901, United Kingdom","Two processes of stereotyping, subtyping and subgrouping, are compared. Subtyping occurs when perceivers respond to members of a target group who disconfirm their stereotypes by seeing them as exceptions to the rule and placing them in a separate subcategory apart from members who confirm the stereotype. The more recently defined process of subgrouping refers to the perceiver's organization of information in terms of clusters of individuals based on their similarities and differences; subgroups can include confirmers and disconfirmers. We consider how subtypes and subgroups are defined, operationalized, and measured, their consequences for stereotype change, and the role of typicality. It is concluded that the clearest difference between subtyping and subgrouping is in terms of their consequences (subtyping leads to the preservation and subgrouping to differentiation of the stereotype). There are, however, some similarities between the processes, and attention is drawn to what future research is required, both to deepen our knowledge of each process and clarify their distinction.","","","","","","","","","Abelson R.P., Modes of resolution of belief dilemmas, Journal of Conflict Resolution, 3, pp. 343-352, (1954); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1979); Andersen S.M., Klatzky R.L., Traits and social stereotypes: Levels of categorization in person perception, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53, pp. 235-246, (1987); Ashmore R.D., Sex stereotypes and implicit personality theory, Cognitive Processes in Stereotyping and Intergroup Behavior, pp. 37-81, (1981); Baron R.A., An ecological view of stereotype accuracy, Stereotype Accuracy: Toward Appreciating Group Differences, pp. 115-140, (1997); Branco K.J., Williamson J.B., Stereotyping and the life cycle: Views of aging and the aged, In the Eye of the Beholder: Contemporary Issues in Stereotyping, pp. 364-510, (1982); Brewer M.B., Social identity, distinctiveness, and in-group homogeneity, Social Cognition, 11, pp. 150-164, (1993); Brewer M.B., Dull V., Lui L., Perceptions of the elderly: Stereotypes as prototypes, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41, pp. 656-670, (1981); Brewer M.B., Lui L., Categorization of the elderly by the elderly: Effects of perceiver's category membership, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 10, pp. 585-595, (1984); Brewer M.B., Miller N., Contact and cooperation: When do they work?, Eliminating Racism: Means and Controversies, pp. 315-326, (1988); Cacioppo J.T., Petty R.E., The need for cognition, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42, pp. 116-131, (1982); Chaiken S., Liberman A., Eagly A.H., Heuristic and systematic information processing within and beyond the persuasion context, Unintended Thought: Limits of Awareness, Intention and Thought, pp. 212-252, (1989); Clifton A.K., McGrath D., Wick B., Stereotypes of women: A single category?, Sex Roles, 2, pp. 135-148, (1976); Deaux K., Lafrance M., Gender, The Handbook of Social Psychology 4th Ed., 1, pp. 788-827, (1998); Deaux K., Winton W., Crowley M., Lewis L.L., Level of categorization and content of gender stereotypes, Social Cognition, 3, pp. 145-167, (1985); Devine P.G., Baker S.M., Measurement of racial stereotype subtyping, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 17, pp. 44-50, (1991); Devine P.G., Elliot A.J., Are racial stereotypes really fading?

Within this stimulus setting, we manipulated the confounding role of the context variable and the distinctiveness of events in terms of their relative infrequency. The experimental procedure allowed us to analyze illusory and spurious correlations in a joint framework, to conduct focused tests for memory effects of relative infrequency and to investigate the detection of covariations with the context variable. The results revealed that illusory and spurious correlations were formed without enhanced memory for infrequent events and with existing covariations of the confounding context factor being well extracted. These observations suggest that illusory and spurious correlations can be understood without assuming specific cognitive processes that are tied to the particular characteristics of a given stimulus distribution, such as enhanced memory in the case of relative infrequency and neglect of a context variable in the case of a confounding factor. Instead, computer simulations with an exemplar-based learning model demonstrated that exemplar-based category learning may provide a coherent and integrative theoretical framework for illusory correlations, spurious correlations and true contingency learning in social cognition.

In addition, researchers have used group judgments that confound stereotypicality with prejudice. Three experiments resolved these methodological problems and provided the first systematic test of Hamburger's (1994) model of stereotype change. In Experiment 1 (N = 60), consistent with Hamburger's predictions, exposure to one deviant group member increased perceived group dispersion, but did not affect judgments of group stereotypicality and prejudice. Experiment 2 (N = 120) replicated these results in an interpersonal setting, but not in an intergroup setting. Experiment 3 (N = 125) replicated the results of Experiment 1 when a member's profile conveyed information about eight stereotype-relevant dimensions, but not when it conveyed information about only four stereotype-relevant dimensions. We discuss the results in the light of past evidence and future strategies for stereotype change. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Study 1 compared male-skewed and male-tilted settings and found evidence of greater polarization by minority women than majority men. The only effect of group proportions occurred for perceived dispersion as a measure of assimilation; replicating Brown and Smith (1989), men showed an out-group (OH), and women an in-group (IH), homogeneity effect, and both effects were accentuated in the skewed setting. Study 2 extended the research to include male-skewed, male-tilted, balanced and female-tilted sex ratios. Men's OH effect declined as relative out-group size increased, and women's IH effect declined as relative in-group size increased. There was also a linear decrease in relative perceived in-group impact and status as actual relative in-group size declined. We discuss our findings with respect to the validity of Kanter's theory, gender and group size as moderators of perceived variability, and methodological issues in studying diversity.

Such consensus inferred from minority/majority source information is contrasted with consensus explicitly provided (e.g., ""20%""). Inferred and explicit consensus influence attitudes interactively. When explicit consensus markedly deviated from self-generated inferred consensus (e.g., a ""majority of 52%"" may appear small), the direction of this discrepancy determined judgments: With relatively high (low) explicit consensus, social influence increased (decreased). In addition, Study 2 showed that the mismatch between inferred and explicit consensus facilitated recall of consensus. Results are discussed within a consensus approach to studying minority and majority influence situations.

Intergroup anxiety was considered an individual-level mediator and realistic and symbolic threat as group-level mediators in the model. We examined the idea that the strength of ingroup identification moderates the predictive power of individual- versus group-level variables. Both contact and relative ingroup status predicted anxiety and perceived threats to the ingroup, which were significant mediators in the model. Our results also suggest that while anxiety predicts attitudes for low but not high identifiers, symbolic threats to the ingroup are more important for high than for low identifiers. There was also some evidence indicating that status perceptions moderate contact effects. We discuss these results in terms of their implications for intergroup relations in Northern Ireland. © 2007 International Society of Political Psychology.","Contact; Identification; Northern Ireland;

In these conflicts, the combatants inhabit the same battlefield. This means that even when the actual fighting fades, the lives of the opposing groups remain interlocked. Subjective elements of conflict often persist long after its “objective” elements disappear. They can become independent of the initiating, more objective causes of the conflict and contribute to an escalation and continuation of violence even after the initial causes have become irrelevant (Deutsch, 1973; Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Thus, the formal resolution of a conflict is often merely the first step toward peaceful coexistence. To promote peace and reconciliation, a psychological process is required to change people’s often deeply-entrenched beliefs and feelings about the outgroup, their ingroup, and the relationship between the two (Bar-Tal, 2000). Group loyalty and the maintenance of group boundaries are dominant features of such conflicts, as are communal memories of victimization. Together they create psychological processes that, if not countered, will lead to further cycles of violence. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Azar F., Mullet E., Vinsonneau G., The propensity to forgive: Findings from Lebanon, Journal of Peace Research, 36, pp. 161-181, (1999); Bar-tal D., From intractable conflict through conflict resolution to reconciliation: Psychological analysis, International Journal of Political Society, 21, pp. 362-365, (2000); Borris E., Diehl P.F., Forgiveness, reconciliation, and the contribution of international peacekeeping, The psychology of peacekeeping, pp. 207-222, (1998); Brewer M.B., The social psychology of intergroup relations: Can research inform practice?, Journal of Social Issues, 53, pp. 197-211, (1997); Brown R.J., Turner J.C., Interpersonal and intergroup behavior, Intergroup behavior, pp. 33-64, (1981); Cairns E., Darby J., The conflict in Northern Ireland-Causes, consequences, and controls, American Psychologist, 53, pp. 754-760, (1998); Cairns E., Hewstone M., Northern Ireland: The impact of peacemaking in Northern Ireland on intergroup behavior, Peace education: The concept, principles and practices around the world, pp. 217-228, (2002); Cairns E., Roe M., The role of memory in ethnic conflict, (2003); Darby J., Northern Ireland: The background to the conflict, (1983); Demoulin S., Leyens J., Paladino P.M., Rodriguez A.P., Rodriguez R.T., Dovidio J., Dimensions of “uniquely” and “non uniquely” human emotions, Cognition and Emotion, 18, pp. 71-96, (2004); Deutsch M., The resolution of conflict, (1973); Dodds G.M., Political apologies: Chronological list, (2003); Enright R.D., Coyle C., Researching the process model of forgiveness within psychological interventions, Dimensions of forgiveness: Psychological research and theological perspectives, pp. 139-161, (1994); Enright R.D., Freedman S., Rique J., The psychology of interpersonal forgiveness, Exploring forgiveness, pp. 46-63, (1998); Enright R.D., Gassin E.A., Longinovic T., Loudon D., Forgiveness as a solution to social crisis, Paper presented at the Morality and Social Crisis conference, Institute for Educational Research, (1994); Enright R.D., The moral development of forgiveness, Handbook of moral behavior and development, pp. 123-152, (1991); Ekman P., An argument for basic emotions, Cognition and Emotion, 6, pp. 169-200, (1992); Esses V.M., Jackson L.M., Armstrong T.L., Intergroup competition and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration: An instrumental model, Journal of Social Issues, 54, pp. 699-724, (1998); Gibson J.L., Gouws A., Truth and reconciliation in South Africa: Attributions to blame and the struggle over apartheid, American Political Science Review, 93, pp. 501-517, (1999); Giffin V.E., McDonagh J., Dunlop J., McMaster J., Smyth G., Brokenness, forgiveness, healing, and peace, (1996); Hamber B., The burdens of truth: An evaluation of the psychological support services and initiatives undertaken by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, American Imago, 55, pp. 9-28, (1998); Hamber B., Wilson R., Symbolic closure through memory, reparation, and revenge in post-conflict societies, Journal of Human Rights, 1, pp. 35-53, (2002); Haslam N., Rothschild L., Ernst D., Essentialist beliefs about social categories, British Journal of Social Psychology, 39, pp. 127-139, (2000); Hewstone M., Cairns E., Voci A., McLernon F., Niens U., Noor M., Intergroup forgiveness and guilt in Northern Ireland: Social psychological dimensions of “The Troubles, Collective guilt: International perspectives, pp. 193-215, (2004); Hewstone M., Rubin M., Willis H., Intergroup bias, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 575-604, (2002); Hirschfeld L.A., Race in the making: Cognition, culture, and the child’s construction of human kinds, (1996); Ignatieff M., There’s no place like home: The politics of belonging, The age of anxiety, (1996); Kulle D., Hamber B., Introduction, Future policies for the past.

If subtyping and perceived typicality ate central to the stereotype change process, then processing instructions designed to affect these processes should affect stereotyping. There was lower stereotyping when perceivers focused on similarities between group members, and after exposure to a dispersed pattern of discontinuing information. Only the main effect of pattern was mediated by the perceived typicality of disconfirmers, but not by an index of subtyping based on clustering of information from disconfirmers in recall. Results support a model of stereotype change in terms of the impact of discontinuing group members who are also seen as typical of the group ; subtyping of extreme disconfirmers may work in parallel, or later, and contribute to the longterm maintenance of a stereotype.","","Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attitude; Cognitive Dissonance; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Social Change; Stereotyping; adult; analysis of variance; article; attitude; clinical trial; cognition; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; group process; human; male; psychological model; randomized controlled trial; social change; social psychology","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Baron R., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Begg I., Similarity and contrast in memory for relations, Memory and Cognition, 6, pp. 509-517, (1978); Bodenhausen G.V., Schwarz N., Bless H., Waenke M., Effects of atypical exemplars on racial beliefs: Enlightened racism or generalized appraisals?, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 31, pp. 48-63, (1995); Brewer M.B., Dull V., Lui L., Perceptions of the elderly: Stereotypes as prototypes, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41, pp. 656-670, (1981); Desforges D.M., Lord C.C., Ramsey S.L., Mason J.A., Van Leeuwen M.D., West S.C., Lepper M.R., Effects of structured cooperative contact on changing negative attitudes toward stigmatized social groups, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, pp. 531-544, (1991); Kinstein G., Hunt R., Levels of processing and organization: Additive effects of individual-item and relational processing, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 6, pp. 588-598, (1980); Epstein M.L., Phillips W.D., Johnson S.J., Recall of related and unrelated word pairs as a function of processing level, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 104, pp. 149-152, (1975); Gurwitz S.B., Dodge K.A., Effects of confirmations and disconfirmations on stereotype-based attributions, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35, pp. 495-500, (1977); Hantzi A., Change in Stereotypic perceptions of familiar and unfamiliar groups: The pervasiveness of the subtyping model, British Journal of Social Psychology, 34, pp. 463-477, (1995); Hewstone M., Revision and change of Stereotypic beliefs: In search of the elusive subtyping model, European Review of Social Psychology, 5, pp. 69-109, (1994); Hewstone M., Contact and categorization: Social psychological interventions to change intergroup relations, Stereotypes and Stereotyping, pp. 323-368, (1996); Hewstone M., Brown R.J., Contact is not enough: An intergroup perspective on the 'contact hypothesis, Contact and Conflict in Intergroup Encounters, pp. 1-44, (1986); Hewstone M., Hamberger J., Perceived variability and stereotype change, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 103-124, (2000); Hewstone M., Johnston L., Aird P., Cognitive models of stereotype change: (2).

The authors conducted two studies to examine the relationship between trust and intergroup behavioral tendencies-and the potential for intergroup contact to build trust in Northern Ireland. Study 1 showed that outgroup trust mediates the impact of intergroup contact on behavioral tendencies toward the outgroup. Study 2 revealed the importance of trusting the outgroup over simply liking the outgroup; establishing outgroup trust is crucial, as trust is a stronger predictor of behavioral tendencies toward the outgroup than positive attitudes are. Results also demonstrated two mechanisms for increasing outgroup trust-through both direct and extended intergroup contact. These studies further our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying the formation of intergroup trust and behavior in areas of conflict. © 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Contact;

Being high in complexity is contingent on situational, cognitive, or motivational factors, and has positive consequences for intergroup relations. Two survey studies conducted in Northern Ireland examined the extent to which intergroup contact and distinctiveness threat act as antecedents, and outgroup attitudes as consequences, of social identity complexity. In both studies, contact was positively, and distinctiveness threat negatively, associated with complex multiple ingroup perceptions, whereas respondents with more complex identity structures also reported more favorable outgroup attitudes. Social identity complexity also mediated the effects of contact and distinctiveness threat on attitudes. This research highlights that the extent to which individuals perceive their multiple ingroups in more or less complex and differentiated ways is of central importance to understanding intergroup phenomena. © 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Distinctiveness threat;

Overall, intergroup anxiety and realistic, but not symbolic, threat emerged as proximal predictors of prejudice and partial mediators between the predictor and criterion variables. But these findings were qualified by majority (Hindu) versus minority (Muslim) group membership. As predicted, while symbolic threat was a predictor of prejudice for Hindus, realistic threat was a paramount predictor for Muslims. In-group status was as a significant predictor for low-status minority group only. The results are discussed with reference to their potential implications for future research and interventions aimed at improving intergroup relations. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Group status; India; Integrated threat theory; Intergroup contact; Prejudice","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Ghosh E.S.K., Kumar R., Hindu-Muslim intergroup relations in India: Applying sociopsychological perspectives, New Directions in Indian Psychology, pp. 222-240, (2001); Hasan M., Legacy of a Divided Nation, (1997); Islam M.R., Hewstone M., Dimensions of contact as predictors of intergroup anxiety, perceived out-group variability, and out-group attitude: An integrative model, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 19, pp. 700-710, (1993); Pettigrew T.F., Meertens R.W., Subtle and blatant prejudice in Western Europe, European Journal of Social Psychology, 25, pp. 57-75, (1995); Pettigrew T.F., Tropp L.R., A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 90, pp. 751-783, (2006); Ruback R.B., Singh P., Inequity in Hindu-Muslim riots: A test of two biases, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38, 4, pp. 982-998, (2008); Singh A.K., Intergroup relations and social tensions, Psychology in India: The State of the Art, pp. 159-224, (1988); Stephan W.G., Boniecki K.A., Ybarra O., Bettencourt A., Ervin K.S., Jackson L.A., McNatt P.S., Renfro C.L., The role of threats in the racial attitudes of blacks and whites, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, pp. 1242-1254, (2002); Stephan W.G., Diaz-Loving R., Duran A., Integrated threat theory and intercultural attitudes: Mexico and the United States, Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology, 31, pp. 240-249, (2000); Stephan W.G., Renfro C.L., The role of threat in intergroup relations, From Prejudice to Intergroup Emotions: Differentiated Reactions to Social Groups, pp. 191-207, (2002); Stephan W.G., Renfro C.L., Esses V.M., Stephan C.W., Martin T., The effects of feeling threatened on attitudes toward immigrants, International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 29, pp. 1-19, (2005); Stephan W.G., Stephan C.W., Intergroup anxiety, Journal of Social Issues, 41, pp. 157-175, (1985); Stephan W.G., Stephan C.W., An integrated threat theory of prejudice, Reducing Prejudice and Discrimination, pp. 23-46, (2000); Tausch N., Hewstone M., Kenworthy J.B., Cairns E., Christ O., Cross-community contact, perceived status differences and intergroup attitudes in Northern Ireland: The mediating roles of individual-level vs. group-level threats and the moderating role of social identification, Political Psychology, 28, pp. 53-68, (2007); Tausch N., Kenworthy J.B., Hewstone M., Intergroup contact and the improvement of intergroup relations, Psychological Approaches to Dealing With Conflict and War, pp. 67-108, (2005); Voci A., Hewstone M., Intergroup contact and prejudice toward immigrants in Italy: The mediational role of anxiety and the moderational role of group salience, Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 6, pp. 37-54, (2003)","N.

Both experiments crossed source status (majority versus minority) with message quality (strong versus weak arguments) to determine which source condition is associated with systematic processing. The first experiment showed a reliable difference between strong and weak messages, indicating systematic processing had occurred, for a minority irrespective of message direction (pro- versus counter-attitudinal), but not for a majority. The second experiment showed that message outcome moderates when a majority or a minority leads to systematic processing. When the message argued for a negative personal outcome, there was systematic processing only for the majority source; but when the message did not argue for a negative personal outcome, there was systematic processing only for the minority source. Thus one key moderator of whether a majority or minority source leads to message processing is whether the topic induces defensive processing motivated by self-interest.

The survey aimed to test hypotheses drawn from Realistic Group Conflict, Social Identity and Contact theories using mainly a correlational design. However, an intervention by members of the outgroup (French fishermen blockading a port) also allowed a quasi-experimental test of the effects of a direct experience of intergroup conflict. Results supported the hypotheses since conflict and national identification were associated with more negative and with less positive attitudes toward the outgroup, while contact had the reverse effects. In addition, the salience of group membership in the contact relationship weakly moderated the effect of contact. © 2001, Sage Publications.

Prior to a referendum on the devolution of power from Britain to Wales, Welsh (minority) and English (majority) participants indicated their attitudes towards each other and towards devolution. As expected, there were significant correlations between intergroup attitudes and attitudes towards devolution, and these relations were different for Welsh vs. English participants. English respondents who held more positive attitudes towards Welsh people were significantly more favourable toward devolution, whereas Welsh respondents who held more positive attitudes towards English people were significantly less favourable towards devolution. A subsequent laboratory experiment provided a conceptual replication of this result, using manipulations of majority vs. minority status and of intergroup attitudes towards potentially devolving groups in psychology. These findings demonstrate that intergroup attitudes are highly relevant to understanding attitudes regarding devolution.","","Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; England; Female; Freedom; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Personal Autonomy; Political Systems; Politics; Power (Psychology); Psychology, Social; Public Opinion; Social Identification; Wales; adolescent; adult; article; attitude; behavior; female; freedom; human; male; middle aged; minority group; personal autonomy; political system; politics; psychological aspect; public opinion; social behavior; social psychology; United Kingdom","","","","","","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Bem D.J., Self-perception theory, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 6, pp. 1-62, (1972); Bobocel D.R., Hing L.S.S., Davey L.M., Stanley D.J., Zanna M.P., Justice-based opposition to social policies: It is genuine?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, pp. 653-669, (1998); Buchanan A., Secession: The Morality of Political Divorce from Fort Sumter to Lithuania and Quebec, (1991); Coakley J., The social origins of nationalist movements and explanations of nationalism: A review, The Social Origins of Nationalist Movements: The Contemporary West European Experience, (1992); Dijker A.J., Kok G., Koomen W., Emotional reactions to people with AIDS, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 26, pp. 731-748, (1996); Eagly A.H., Mladinic A., Otto S., Cognitive and affective bases of attitudes toward social groups and social policies, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 30, pp. 113-137, (1994); Esses V.M., Haddock G., Zanna M.P., Values, stereotypes, and emotions as determinants of intergroup attitudes, Affect, Cognition, and Stereotyping: Interactive Processes in Group Perception, pp. 137-166, (1993); Esses V.M., Maio G.R., Expanding the assessment of attitude components and structure: The benefits of open-ended measures, European Review of Social Psychology, 12, pp. 71-102, (2002); Haddock G., Zanna M.P., Esses V.M., Assessing the structure of prejudicial attitudes: The case of attitudes toward homosexuals, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, pp. 1105-1118, (1993); Haslam S.A., Turner J.C., Oakes P.J., McGarty C., Hayes B.K., Context dependent variation in stereotyping. 1.

Recent evidence, however, supports an own-race effect at the level of perceptual encoding in adults. The current study examines the perceptual basis of the own-race effect in secondary students from two racially segregated communities (White and South Asian). The contact hypothesis is investigated, as other-race experience may influence other-race face perception. Face stimuli were generated by morphing together South Asian and White faces along a linear continuum. In a same/different perceptual discrimination task participants judged whether face stimuli were physically identical to, or different from, the original faces. Results revealed a significant own-race effect for the White participants only, wherein they were better at discriminating White relative to South Asian faces. Other-race individuating experience was found to predict the own-race effect, indicating that other-race experience influences other-race face perceptual expertise.

Using a computerized minimal group classification procedure and a 'proofreading' priming task, participants were asked to evaluate different crossed-category groups following either a neutral, an inclusive (in-group), or an exclusive (out-group) prime. The results supported the notion that inclusiveness priming can moderate how perceivers represent and evaluate composite social groups.

This chapter deals with the nature, extent, processes, and consequences of cross-community or intergroup contact that occurs in this setting, despite segregation. The chapter considers six central issues: (a) the historical and social background to the political violence in Northern Ireland; (b) the extent of segregation, its causes and consequences; (c) the theoretical background to the ""contact hypothesis"" and its relevance for, and application in, Northern Ireland; (d) major findings from our research programme; (e) policy implications of our research; and (f ) general conclusions that can be drawn and areas where future work is still needed. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Books, Inc.

An analysis of the headlines of five British newspapers, over a period of five years, revealed that the words 'majority' and 'minority' appeared 658 times. Majority headlines were most frequent (66%), more likely to emphasize the numerical size of the majority, to link majority status with political groups, to be described with positive evaluations, and to cover political issues. By contrast, minority headlines were less frequent (34%), more likely to link minority status with ethnic groups and to other social issues, and less likely to be described with positive evaluations. The implications of examining how real-life majorities and minorities are represented for our understanding of experimental research are discussed.

A recent policy initiative to promote a 'Shared Future' acknowledges that the problems of residential segregation relate, at least in part, to endemic fear and sense of threat in divided communities. The research presented in this article reflects on this 'psychological' analysis of the problem through an exploration of the basis of negative emotional responses in two of Belfast's most segregated areas, and examines potential mediators of more positive responses towards the 'outgroup'. The article concludes with policy recommendations for mitigating fear and anxiety associated with residential segregation. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","ALLPORT G.W., THE NATURE OF PREJUDICE, New York: Addison-Wesley, (1954); BAR-TAL D., From intractable conflict through conflict resolution to reconciliation: Psychological analysis, Political Psychology, 21, pp. 351-365, (2000); BAR-TAL D., Why does fear override hope in societies engulfed by intractable conflict, as it does in the Israeli society?, Political Psychology, 22, 3, pp. 601-627, (2001); BETTELHEIM B., JANOWITZ M., Dynamics of Prejudice: A Psychological and Sociological Study of Veterans, (1950); BLAIR I.V., PARK B., BACHELOR J., Understanding intergroup anxiety: Are some people more anxious than others?, Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 6, 2, pp. 151-169, (2003); CAIRNS E., HEWSTONE M., The impact of peacemaking in Northern Ireland on intergroup behaviour, The Nature and Study of Peace Education, pp. 217-228, (2002); CARVER C.S., SCHEIER M.F., Origins and functions of positive and negative affect: A control-process view, Psychological Review, 97, pp. 19-35, (1990); CLORE G.L., Cognitive phenomenology: Feelings in the construction of judgement, The Construction of Social Judgement, pp. 133-164, (1992); CLORE G.L., SCHWARZ N., CONWAY M., Affective causes and consequences of social information processing, Handbook of Social Cognition, 1, pp. 323-417, (1994); COOK S.W., Cooperative interaction in multiethnic contexts, Groups in Contact: The Psychology of Desegregation, pp. 155-185, (1984); DARBY J., Intimidation and the Control of the Conflict in Northern Ireland, (1986); DARBY J., MURRAY D., BATTS D., DUNN S., FARREN S., HARRIS J., Education and community in Northern Ireland: Schools apart, (1977); DOVIDIO J.F., GAERTNER S.L., KAWAKAMI K., Intergroup contact: The past, present and future, Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 6, 1, pp. 5-21, (2003); The Nature of Emotion: Fundamental Question, (1994); FRIJDA N.H., The Emotions, (1986); FRIJDA N.H., MESQUITA B., The social roles and functions of emotions, Emotion and Culture: Empirical Studies of Mutual Influence, pp. 51-87, (1994); GALLAGHER A.M., Social identity and the Northern Ireland conflict, Human Relations, 42, pp. 917-935, (1989); GALLAGHER D.J., CLORE G.L., Emotion and judgement.

The latter two theories grew out of a critique of social identity theory, but this critique relates more to deficiencies in social identity research than to deficiencies in the theory itself. More balanced and comprehensive social identity research is required in order to allow a fair assessment of the theory's limitations. In addition. Reicher (2004) and Huddy (2004) are correct that only social identity theory offers the potential for explaining social change and social stability.","Ingroup favoritism; Intergroup discrimination; Outgroup favoritism; Social dominance theory; Social identity theory; System justification theory","","","","","","","","Ahrams D., Hogg M.A., Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and intergroup discrimination, European Journal of Social Psychology, 18, pp. 317-334, (1988); Ahrams D., Hogg M.A., Collective identity: Group membership and self-conception, Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Group Processes, pp. 423-460, (2001); Billig M., Remembering the particular background of social identity theory, Social Groups and Identities: Developing the Legacy of Henri Tajfel, pp. 337-357, (1996); Blanz M., Mummendey A., Mielke R., Klink A., Responding to negative social identity: A taxonomy of identity management strategies, European Journal of Social Psychology, 28, pp. 697-729, (1998); Bourhis R.Y., Power, gender and intergroup discrimination: Some minimal group studies, The Psychology of Prejudice: The 7th Ontario Symposium on Personality and Social Psychology, pp. 171-208, (1994); Bourhis R.Y., Hill P., Intergroup perception in British higher education: A field study, Social Identity and Intergroup Relations, pp. 423-468, (1982); Branscombe N.R., Wann D.L., Collective self-esteem consequences of outgroup derogation when a valued social identity is on trial, European Journal of Social Psychology, 24, pp. 641-657, (1994); Brauer M., Intergroup perception in the social context: The effects of social status and group membership on perceived out-group homogeneity and ethnocentrism, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 37, pp. 15-31, (2001); Brauer M., Judd C.M., Defining variables in relationship to other variables: When inter-actions suddenly turn out to be main effects, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 410-423, (2000); Brewer M.B., Ingroup bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive-motivational analysis, Psychological Bulletin, 86, pp. 307-324, (1979); Brown J.D., Collins R.L., Schmidt G.W., Self-esteem and direct versus indirect forms of self-enhancement, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55, pp. 445-453, (1988); Brown R., Divided we fall: An analysis of relations between sections of a factory workforce, Differentiation between Social Groups: Studies in the Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations, pp. 395-429, (1978); Brown R.J., Turner J.C., Interpersonal and intergroup behaviour, Intergroup Behaviour, pp. 33-65, (1981); Caddick B., Perceived illegitimacy and intergroup relations, Social Identify and Intergroup Relations, pp. 137-154, (1982); Crocker J., Blaine B., Luhtanen R., Prejudice, intergroup behaviour and self-esteem: Enhancement and protection motives, Group Motivation: Social Psychological Perspectives, pp. 52-67, (1993); Doosje B., Spears R., Ellemers N., Koomen W., Perceived group variability in intergroup relations: The distinctive role of social identity, European Review of Social Psychology, 10, pp. 41-74, (1999); Farsides T., Why Social Identity Theory's Self-esteem Hypothesis Has Never Been Tested - And How to Test It, (1995); Gagnon A., Bourhis R.Y., Discrimination in the minimal group paradigm: Social identity or self-interest?, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 22, pp. 1289-1301, (1996); Guimond S., Dambrun M., Michinov N., Duarte S., Does social dominance generate prejudice?

The most convincing theoretical account is provided by perspectives that concentrate on the distinct nature of intergroup phenomena (especially social identity theory). Two of the most promising social-psychological interventions to reduce intergroup conflict are also reviewed. The first is based on improving contact between members of previously hostile groups; the second attempts to change the structure of social categorizations (via decategorization, recategorization, and crossed categorization). This social-psychological perspective is proposed as a key part of a necessary, multi-disciplinary approach to intergroup conflict.","","","","","","","","","Bettencourt B.A., Brewer M.B., Rogers-Croak M., Miller N., Cooperation and the reduction of intergroup bias: The role of reward structure and social orientation, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 28, pp. 301-319, (1992);

The novel mediator proposed here, cognitions of rejection, predicted intergroup anxiety, and also predicted the three outcome variables via intergroup anxiety. Over and above its indirect effects via anxiety, cognitions of rejection directly predicted both conversational and active avoidance, suggesting that whilst the cognitive and affective mediators are linked, they predict intergroup outcomes in different ways. The results demonstrate the beneficial impact of cross group friendship in reducing prejudice and avoidance by diminishing cognitions of rejection and intergroup anxiety. We also highlight that individuals without cross-group friends may perceive the outgroup as rejecting, feel anxious about cross-group interaction, and desire both conversational and physical avoidance of the outgroup. © 2009 The British Psychological Society.","","Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Culture; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Friends; Humans; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Prejudice; Queensland; Rejection (Psychology); Social Distance; Social Identification; Social Perception; Verbal Behavior; Young Adult; Aborigine; adolescent; adult; anxiety; article; attitude; Australia; Caucasian; cultural anthropology; decision making; female; friend; human; male; middle aged; perception; psychological aspect; social behavior; social distance; social psychology; verbal behavior","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice, (1954); Barlow F.K., Louis W.R., Terry D.J., Minority report: Social identity, cognitions of rejection and intergroup anxiety predicting prejudice from one racially marginalized group towards another, (2008); Biernat M., Masis M., Kobrynowicz D., Simultaneous assimilation and contrast effects in judgments of self and others, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, pp. 254-569, (1997); Bourgeois K.S., Leary M.R., Coping with rejection: Derogating those who choose us last, Motivation and Emotion, 25, pp. 101-111, (2001); Branscombe N.R., Schmitt M.T., Schiffhauer K., Racial attitudes in response to thoughts of white privilege, European Journal of Social Psychology, 37, pp. 203-215, (2007); Brown R., Hewstone H., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in experimental social psychology, 37, pp. 255-343, (2005); Butz D.A., Plant E.A., Perceiving outgroup members as unresponsive: Implications for approach-related emotions, intentions, and behavior, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 91, pp. 1066-1079, (2006); Campbell D.T., Fiske D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitraitmultimethod matrix, Psychological Bulletin, 56, pp. 81-105, (1959); Corenblum B., Stephan W.G., White fears and native apprehensions: An integrated threat theory approach to intergroup attitudes, Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science, 33, pp. 251-268, (2001); Downey G., Feldman S.I., Implications of rejection sensitivity for intimate relationships, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, pp. 1327-1342, (1996); Harwood J., Hewstone M., Paolini S., Voci A., Grandparen-grandchild contact and attitudes toward older adults: Moderator and mediator effects, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 393-406, (2005); Herek G.M., Capitanio J.P., Some of my best friends: Intergroup contact, concealable stigma, and heterosexuals' attitudes towards gay men and lesbians, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 22, pp. 412-424, (1996); Herek G.M., Capitanio J.P., Sex differences in how heterosexuals think about lesbians and gay men: Evidence from survey context effects, Journal of Sex Research, 36, pp. 348-360, (1999); Hewstone M., Brown R., Contact is not enough: An intergroup perspective on the 'contact hypothesis, Contact and conflict in intergroup encounters, pp. 1-44, (1986); Hu L.-T., Bentler P.M., Evaluating model fit, Structural equation modeling: Concepts, issues, and applications, pp. 76-99, (1995); (2005); Insko C.A., Schopler J., Hoyle R.H., Dardis G.J., Graetz K.A., Individual-group discontinuity as a function of fear and greed, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58, pp. 68-79, (1990); Iyer A., Leach C.W., Crosby F.J., White guilt and racial compensation: The benefits and limits of self-focus, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 29, pp. 117-129, (2003); Keating P., (1992); Little T.D., Cunningham W.A., Shahar G., Widaman K.F., To parcel or not to parcel: Exploring the question, weighing the merits, Structural Equation Modeling, 9, pp. 151-173, (2002); Maner J.K., DeWall C.N., Baumeister R.F., Schaller M., Does social exclusion motivate interpersonal reconnection?

The perceptual processing of own-versus two groups of other-race faces was therefore explored in White and South Asian individuals. Participants completed a computer-based discrimination task of White, South Asian and Black face-morphs. Results showed a generalized own-race effect for White and South Asian participants discriminating own-versus other-race (White/South Asian and Black) faces, such that individuals demonstrated a perceptual discrimination advantage for own-versus other-race faces in general. These findings were linked to implicit racial bias and other-race individuating experience, demonstrating that social variables play an important role in the magnitude of the own-race effect.

Two studies were conducted in different countries, in which participants explained their thoughts and feelings concerning a specific (e.g., ""Indians"" or ""Chinese"") or abstract (e.g., ""Ethnic Minorities"") attitude object, and then rated the importance of each thought or feeling. A coding scheme was used to record the attitude function represented by each thought or feeling. In both studies, symbolic functions were more present for the abstract target than the specific targets. These differences have important implications for interventions and theories that address prejudice.

C. Wright, A. Aron, T. McLaughlin-Volpe, and S. A. Ropp (1997) proposed that the benefits associated with cross-group friendship might also stem from vicarious experiences of friendship. Extended contact was proposed to reduce prejudice by reducing intergroup anxiety, by generating perceptions of positive ingroup and outgroup norms regarding the other group, and through inclusion of the outgroup in the self. This article documents the first test of Wright et al.'s model, which used structural equation modeling among two independent samples in the context of South Asian-White relations in the United Kingdom. Supporting the model, all four variables mediated the relationship between extended contact and outgroup attitude, controlling for the effect of direct contact. A number of alternative models were ruled out, indicating that the four mediators operate concurrently rather than predicting one another. © 2008 American Psychological Association.","extended intergroup contact; inclusion of the outgroup in the self; ingroup norms; intergroup anxiety; outgroup norms","Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Attitude; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Psychological Tests; Psychological Theory; Self Concept; Social Perception; adolescent; adult; anxiety; article; attitude; female; human; human relation; male; perception; psychologic test; psychological aspect; psychological theory; self concept","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The nature of prejudice (25th anniversary ed.), (1979); Amir Y., Katz P., The role of intergroup contact in change of prejudice and race relations, Towards the elimination of racism, pp. 245-308, (1976); Aron A., Aron E.N., Smollan D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612, (1992); Aron A., Aron E.N., Tudor M., Nelson G., Close relationships as including other in the self, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, pp. 241-253, (1991); Batson C.D., Early S., Salvarani G., Perspective taking: Imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, pp. 751-758, (1997); Brown R., Hewstone H., An integrative theory of intergroup contact, Advances in experimental social psychology, 37, pp. 255-343, (2005); Cameron L., Rutland A., Brown R., Douch R., Changing children's intergroup attitudes toward refugees: Testing different models of extended contact, Child Development, 77, pp. 1208-1219, (2006); Casciani D., Analysis: UK at ease with Islam?, (2005); Cialdini R.B., Kallgren C.A., Reno R.R., A focus theory of normative conduct, Advances in experimental social psychology, 24, pp. 201-234, (1991); Cook S.W., Interpersonal and attitudinal outcomes in co-operating interracial groups, Journal of Research in Developmental Education, 12, pp. 97-113, (1978); Cooper J., Hogg M.A., Feeling the anguish of others: A theory of vicarious dissonance, Advances in experimental social psychology, 39, pp. 359-403, (2007); Dittes J.E., Attractiveness of a group as a function of self-esteem and acceptance by group, Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 59, pp. 77-82, (1959); Duckitt J., The social psychology of prejudice, (1992); Eller A., Abrams D., Gringos"" in Mexico: Cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of language school-promoted contact on intergroup bias, Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 6, pp. 55-75, (2003); Fazio R.H., Multiple processes by which attitudes guide behavior: The mode model as an integrative framework, Advances in experimental social psychology, 23, pp. 75-109, (1990); Haddock G., Zanna M.P., Esses V.M., Assessing the structure of prejudicial attitudes: The case of attitudes toward homosexuals, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, pp. 1105-1118, (1993); Hamberger J., Hewstone M., Inter-ethnic contact as a predictor of blatant and subtle prejudice: Tests of a model in four Western European nations, British Journal of Social Psychology, 36, pp. 173-190, (1997); Haslam S.A., McGarty C., Turner J.C., Salient group membership and persuasion: The role of social identity in the validation of beliefs, What is social about social cognition?

There are diverse, overlapping, and interwoven ways in which we can describe ourselves and others: young, British, Asian, woman, Muslim, engineer, and so on. We know that which of these identities is used in person perception depends upon a variety of factors, including context and motivation; but also that identities are not mutually exclusive. We can be, and often are, identified and we identify others according to a combination of group memberships: a disabled athlete, a young Briton, a female engineer. Research on multiple social categorization has found that our many and varied, cross-cutting and convoluted, social identities have significant implications for understanding, and attenuating, prejudice and intergroup discrimination. This chapter reviews our own and others' research on multiple social categorization and discusses when and how different multiple categorization strategies can lead to more positive intergroup attitudes. We develop a model of the processes involved and explain how this work can help policy makers and practitioners in their efforts to promote, encourage, and enhance harmonious intergroup relations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It is observed that researchers have tended to employ measures of global personal trait self-esteem in their investigations of this self-esteem hypothesis, and it is argued that measures of specific social state self-esteem are more consistent with social identity theory's assumptions. Although no convincing evidence is found for the self-esteem hypothesis in its full and unqualified form, it is argued that this is due to a lack of specificity in its formulation and it is suggested that a more qualified and specific version of the hypothesis may be more appropriate.

Results pro vided some support for the ‘conversion’ model (in which stereotypes change in response to salient instances) in the case of a homogeneous group, where stereotypical responding was lower in concentrated than dispersed conditions. In the heterogeneous‐group conditions, there was no effect of pattern. In addition, subjects' estimates of stereotype‐consistent information were higher, and of inconsistent information were lower, and they perceived more members as typical, and fewer as atypical, when the target group was heterogeneous versus homogeneous. There was also support for the ‘subtyping’ model (in which disconfirming individuals are isolated from other group members) in the concentrated conditions. A theoretical account of these findings is given in terms of stereotype change via salience for homogeneous groups, and the need to integrate research on cognitive models of stereotype change and perceived group variability.

In Experiment 1, Muslims (majority) and Hindus (minority) in Bangladesh rated their explanations of in-group and out-group members' positive and negative acts on 4 causal dimensions: locus, stability, controllability by others, and globality. Both groups showed in-group-favoring attributions, but only Muslims were out-group derogating. Causal dimensions predicted affects primarily in in-group-outcome conditions. Experiment 2 showed that this bias for Muslims varied across crossed-categorization conditions. Causal dimensions predicted affect and self-esteem in certain conditions. Experiment 3 showed that this bias for Hindus was accentuated when social categorizations were made salient. These studies increase understanding of the determinants and consequences of the bias.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00223514","","JPSPB","","English","J. Pers. Soc.

A distinction was drawn between â€œopportunities forâ€ and â€œreal uses ofâ€ contact, operationalized using path analysis, and hypotheses were tested concerning the way contact in the neighborhood, at school, and in leisure time is related to prejudice. As predicted, leisure time contact was significantly correlated with reduced prejudice, but only for the German sample (N = 60); for the Turkish sample (N = 50), prejudice was unrelated to any of the measures of contact.

The source of consensus was specified by basing this information on others of the same sex category as the actor, and effects of personal and non‐personal stimuli were also investigated to extend McArthur's classic study. Subjects completed a 16‐item questionnaire in which they were asked to attribute an effect to person, stimulus, circumstance or ‘combination’ causes. The three information variables each significantly affected causal attribution, and consistency accounted for the largest percentage of the total variance. However, consensus information was a much more important determinant of attributions to person and stimulus than has previously been found. These differences were explained in terms of generalization gradients within people and across actors. 1983 The British Psychological Society","","adult; central nervous system; generalization; human; human experiment; information; normal human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","01446665","","","","English","Br.

Different expectancy‐value models— based on manipulations of scoring procedure (bi‐polar vs. uni‐polar scoring of beliefs) and combinatorial rule (multiplication vs. addition of value and expectancy components) ‐were explicitly compared. Although they used different attitudinal items and samples, both studies obtained significantly lower correlations with overall attitude by using the multiplicative/bi‐polar belief model than by using multiplicative/uni‐polar belief and additive models. Linear transformations of the belief component had a dramatic effect on the multiplicative model, but had no impact on the additive model.

The tendency for attributions to favour ingroup over outgroup members is found in three paradigms — explanations for positive and negative outcomes, success and failure, and group differences — and in most of the 19 studies reviewed, but the evidence provides only limited support for Pettigrew's (1979) ‘ultimate attribution error’. The evidence is limited to specific dimensions in a given study, but strongest for three general findings: (1) More internal attribution for positive acts, and less internal attribution for negative acts, by ingroup than outgroup members; (2) More attribution of outgroup than ingroup failure to lack of ability, and ‘explaining away’ outgroup success to good luck, high effort or an easy task; (3) A preference for ingroup‐serving versus outgroup‐serving attributions for group differences. Finally, theoretical issues and methodological shortcomings are discussed with reference to future research.

This programme provides a real‐life application of the ‘conversion’ model of stereotype change (in which stereotypes change radically in response to salient instances of disconfirming information). Study 1 revealed that school police officers were rated significantly more positively than the police in general, but that this view did not generalize to perceptions of the police in general. Stereotypes of the police became less positive over one year, although females were more positive than males, and school police officers were not judged typical of the category. Study 2 revealed that subjects categorized their school police officer separately from the police in general, and perceived him to share features with ‘caring and welfare’ professions, rather than other police officers and authority figures. Both studies converge on the limitations of the conversion model and tend to support the subtyping model (in which extremely disconfirming individuals are isolated from other group members).

This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of the effects of crossed categorization on intergroup evaluations. The present effort was able to contrast and evaluate 11 models previously proposed to account for the effects of crossed categorization. The category differentiation (reduction) model received the most support insofar as (a) it rendered predictions of intergroup evaluations that were significant and of moderate magnitude, and (b) these predictions varied as a significant function of the proposed underlying mechanism for the model (the similarity between the categorization dimensions). We discuss the implications of these results for future research on crossed categorization.","","","","","","","","","Arcuri L., Three patterns of social categorization in attribution memory, European Journal of Social Psychology, 12, pp. 271-282, (1982);

The design was 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 (Ethnic Group × Outgroup Prejudice × Outcome × Stimulus) with repeated measures on the last two factors. Subjects attributed examination performance to ability, effort, luck, and task difficulty. Intergroup bias was limited to German pupils, who attributed failure of an ingroup member or self more to bad luck than they did that of an outgroup member. Turkish pupils acted more in terms of self than ingroup, attributing the success of another Turkish child more to good luck than they did that of self or an outgroup member. They also failed to distinguish clearly between success and failure in their task attributions. Results are discussed in terms of the inventive nature of explanations for ability-linked performance and the motivational consequences of causal attributions. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Achievement;

Stereotype change is generally greater following a dispersed than a concentrated pattern of disconfirming information, over a variety of conditions. Evidence yielded by several cognitive measures supports a prototype version of the subtyping model, whereby change is brought about via typical ‘disconfirmers’ and is inhibited if disconfirmers are extremely atypical and thus easily assigned to a separate subcategory. Subtyping is viewed as a fundamental aspect of group representations, albeit incompletely understood, that seems to insulate stereotypes from change. © 1994, John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

An adapted version of the Kahneman‐Tversky cab problem was used, to provide a social decision in which biases could be measured against some normative standard. Ethnicity of youth (white/West Indian) and nature of base rate (incidental/causal) were manipulated in a 2 × 2 between‐subjects design. A significant interaction effect revealed that subjects took no account of the base rate for a West Indian subject, but used the base rate only when it was causal and the youth was white. This ‘prejudice effect’ against a West Indian youth and ‘exoneration effect’ for a white youth were replicated in a second study, using a microcomputer and chronometric analyses. Results are discussed in terms of heuristic decision‐making, social schemata, and the cognitive versus motivational bases of bias in the use of base rates.

As such, it dealt with group‐level rather than individual‐level attributions, exploring whether bias in making such verbal attributions varied as a function of the interviewer's group identity and the presence of an ingroup audience. Undergraduate men and women at The Chinese University of Hong Kong rated the appropriateness of ingroup‐favouring and outgroup‐favouring explanations for male‐typed and female‐typed behaviors in a face‐to‐face interview. A group‐serving bias was found for female‐typed behaviours, but only when the same‐sex audience was absent. A conceptual replication of the experiment was run in the United States to examine the possible cultural basis for the Chinese moderation of favouritism in the audience condition. The group‐serving bias was more robust for the American undergraduates, extending across male‐ and female‐typed behaviours and also across audience conditions, It was argued that these cultural differences in attributional bias appear to reflect the strength of the movement for women's liberation and norms surrounding the avoidance of conflict in the United States and Hong Kong.

Experiment 2 was an extension of the research, including new measures. Both studies showed additive effects of religion and nationality, as predicted by 3 models, a strong effect of category dominance for religion, and out-group homogeneity only when the religious in-group was the dominant and majority group in its country.

In particular, we investigated the heuristic utility of stereotype application in difficult or demanding information‐processing contexts. Our results supported the prediction that stereotypical effects on memory are contingent upon the characteristics of the task environment. Whereas perceivers displayed preferential recall for stereotype‐inconsistent information under low processing loads, this switched to a preference for consistent information as task demands increased. Likewise, target‐based judgments were most stereotypic under high processing loads. Judgment‐recall correlations supported the contention that, under high‐loads, these inferences are related to the relative memorability of stereotypic information. We consider these findings in the wider context of stereotype‐based effects on social cognition.

To this end, we present theoretical models of how language acts (a) as a dependent variable of people's subjective construals of situations, and (b) as an independent variable creatively defining and redefining situations for those involved. As we view speech and situations as interdependent so too do we consider the aforementioned models as operating simultaneously in social interaction. We feel that our integrative approach may be important not only in promoting the development of an interdisciplinary model of language in its social context but also in attempting to arrive at models of codeshifting that transcend the present focus on taxonomy. © 1982.","","","","","","","Mainson de la Science de l'Homme; Leverhulme Trust","1.

The evaluation is based on the ‘contact hypothesis’ in intergroup relations, and highlights four sets of dependent measures: background perceptions, ingroup and outgroup ratings, knowledge, and judgements about work with outgroup partners and experienced contact. Consistent with the contact hypothesis, both studies revealed an improvement in outgroup attitudes, evidence of mutual intergroup differentiation (acknowledged superiority of ingroup and outgroup on independent dimensions), and increased outgroup knowledge. Greater change in Study 2 is interpreted in terms of its longer duration, and the opportunity it provided for contact with multiple outgroup members, compared with a single outgroup partner in Study 1. These findings from field studies are consistent with results from published laboratory experiments.

The Logical Model specifies precisely how information might be encoded from attributional vignettes and how subjects might consider different causal loci as necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of an effect. Predictions are derived for each of the eight information configurations on the basis of consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency information. The model is tested with data from three published experiments and is preferred over a template model of attribution. The Logical Model's limitations are also acknowledged in that responses deviate systematically from its predictions, leading to an analysis of the notion of causality underlying stimulus, person, and circumstance attributions. © 1987 American Psychological Association.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00223514","","JPSPB","","English","J.

Twenty-seven pairs of Dutch secondary school pupils were assigned at random to work together in triads to solve two word puzzles. The triads consisted of one Turkish pupil, always a confederate, and two Dutch pupils. The three conditions varied according to whether reference was made to the ethnic background of the confederate in both an introductory conversation and in the conversation-break between puzzles (High-High salience); only in the later break (Low-High); or not at all (Low-Low). Results show no differences between conditions in attitudes towards the partner, which were quite positive. However, attitude change only generalized in the two conditions in which ethnic membership was made salient (Low-High and High-High, which did not differ).

Part I studied the shared social beliefs 0f 20 ‘Public’ (PS) and 20 ‘Comprehensive’ (CS) schoolboys (age 16 years) concerning similarities and differences between the two types of schoolboy. Each subject wrote a short essay on the topic and these essays were content‐analysed into 13 differences and 4 similarities between the two types of school. The two groups agreed on a number of points, but consensus within each group on a number of beliefs revealed distinct social representations. Part II studied the effect of group membership and social categorization on causal attributions for success and failure in examinations. Twenty‐four PS and 24 CS boys {age 16–17 years) were used in a 2 (school of subjects) × 2 (school of stimuli) × 2 (success/failure) design, with one between and two within‐subject factors. Each subject read four background descriptions of candidates for university entrance, then made a number of ratings. On the page following each description, subjects attributed the candidate's performance to ability, effort, task difficulty and luck; a confidence rating was also made. Analyses of variance suggested that second‐order interactions between group membership of the subjects, social categorization of the stimuli and achievement outcome were most important. Public schoolboys differentiated themselves from the CS boys by means of ability (p < 0.08 and effort (p < 0.0005) attributions; CS boys differentiated in tern of luck (p < 0.06). Part III studied social identity processes in the same 48 subjects. Each subject read a 20—item questionnaire based on Part I, with 10 traits classified as Public and 10 as Comprehensive; within each set of traits half were autostereotype and half heterostereotype traits. Subjects made group‐ratings, evaluations and self‐ratings on each trait. Analyses of variance [2 (schools) × 2 (items) × 2 (stereotype)] were computed on each dependent measure. For the group ratings a main effect of items (p < 0.0001) revealed that PS and CS items were differentially ascribed to the two groups. In addition, CS boys valued CS‐autostereotype items most highly (p < 0.05) and rated themselves higher on CS items (p < 0.0001). Results are discussed in terms of the influence of social representations on both causal attributions and intergroup differentiation; the existence of intergroup biases in achievement attributions; and the different modes of differentiation chosen by the different status groups. Social Identity Theory is seen as a valuable framework with which to consider these findings.

The first study (N = 64) utilized an experimental paradigm in which the perceived typicality of a target outgroup member and the perceived homogeneity of the outgroup as a whole were manipulated. Consistent with our hypothesis, results indicated that positive attitudinal generalization was facilitated by encounters with typical outgroup members. The effects of membership prototypicality were further examined in a second study (N = 293) where a survey was administered in six European Community countries. Results supported the hypothesis that membership salience moderates the impact of contact on a generalized measure of favourable orientation towards another country.

This was achieved by secondary analysis of survey data (Eurobarometer 30, 1988) from respondents in four West European countries, asked about various ethnic out-groups (West Germany/Turks; France/Asians; France/North Africans; Dutch/Turks; Durch/Surinamese; British/Asians; British/West Indians). We developed and tested a path model in one sample, and then tested it across six others, first for blatant and then for subtle prejudice. Contact-as-friends had a significant negative effect on blatant prejudice in six samples; there were also strong negative effects for education and value orientation, and education was a significant predictor of contact-as-friends. Tests of the goodness-of-fit of models with and without contact showed that prediction was significantly improved by the inclusion of contact-as-friends in four samples. Results were generally parallel for subtle prejudice, but prediction was much weaker. These results are discussed in terms of future interventions to decrease prejudice and some critical questions concerning the 'contact hypothesis'.","","","","","","","","","Abrams D., Hogg M.A., Social Identifications: A Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations and Group Processes, (1990); Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, (1954); Almond G., Verba S., The Civic Culture Revisited, (1980); Amir Y., Contact hypothesis in ethnic relations, Psychological Bulletin, 71, pp. 319-342, (1969); Blank T., Schmidt P., Verletzte oder verletzende Nation?

The reverse holds true for attributions to outgroup members. Methodological shortcomings of this important earlier study were discussed and overcome in the reported studies. In Experiment 1 we tested this hypothesis in Malaysia with groups of Chinese and Malay ethnicity. Subjects of both groups were asked to ascribe to internal or external causes the behavior of ingroup and outgroup members performing socially desirable or undesirable acts. The hypothesis was supported only for the Malays, whereas the Chinese favored the outgroup. These results were consistent with a limited analysis of auto- and heterostereotypes. Explanations in terms of group status, cultural context, and particular characteristics of the Chinese suggested a replication of the study in Singapore, where relationships between the same groups are quite different. Experiment 2 revealed ingroup favoritism for the Malays once again, although the Chinese no longer favored the outgroup. These less extreme results mapped onto the stereotypes and mirrored the more multicultural environment in Singapore. Differences between the studies are discussed in terms of wider sociostructural and cultural influences that indicate that ethnocentric attribution is not a universal tendency. © 1985 American Psychological Association.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00223514","","JPSPB","","English","J.

Trait ratings in all three experiments showed there to be greater stereotype‐change when stereotype‐inconsistent information was dispersed across many group members than when it was concentrated in only a few. A sorting task (Experiment 1) indicated that, in the concentrated conditions the stereotype disconfirmers were more strongly isolated from the rest of the group than in the dispersed conditions. Free recall protocols (Experiment 2) showed greater memory for the target exemplars when subjects anticipated interaction with a group member than when no interaction was anticipated. The questions subject chose to ask target group exemplars were also influenced by anticlpated future interaction. Subjects chose more stereotype‐inconsistent questions when interactian was anticipated than when no interaction was anticipated. Experment 3 showed the impact of stereotype‐inconsistent information to be greater when expectancies for the stereotyped group are weaker A cued‐recall task yielded evidence of spontaneous subtyping. All these studies support the subtyping model, even in the presence of cognitive and motivational factors that might be expected to impede stereotype change.

All three studies presented subjects with a pattern of stereotype-disconfirming information that was either concentrated within a few or dispersed across several group members. Experiment 1 crossed this pattern factor with order of rating and memory tasks and identified a new memory-based measure of subtyping (clustering of items in free recall by subcatgory). Ratings on stereotype-inconsistent traits were lower and clustering scores higher in the concentrated condition, irrespective of order of tasks. Experiment 2 crossed pattern with whether stimulus information was blocked-by-person or unblocked. Ratings on stereotype-inconsistent traits were higher when information was both dispersed and blocked; subtyping was strong only when information was both concentrated and blocked.

Both studies measured accentuation effects (more intra‐ than inter‐race errors) and own‐group bias (fewer confusions between own‐ than other‐group members) in person memory, using the paradigm developed by Taylor, Fiske, Etcoff and Ruderman (1978). Experiment 1 studies the generalization of these effects across ethnic group membership (black/white) and topic (categorization‐relevant/irrelevant) in a 2 × 2 [× 4] between‐subject design, with type of error as a repeated measure. There was a highly significant accentuation effect, which was not affected by either topic or group membership. Experiment 2, using white subjects only, manipulated anticipated future interaction/no interaction, which affected overall accuracy/error rate, but not the strong accentuation effect. Neither study found any support for an own‐group bias. Results are discussed in terms of the automaticity of race as a basis for social categorization.

Twenty‐ four Black (mostly West Indian) and 24 White adolescents (age 16‐19) were assigned in pairs to each cell of a 2 (Race of subject: Black/White) × 2 (Discussion/No Discussion) ‘mixed’ design. Each subject read four items exemplifying types of racial discrimination and attributed each to negative dispositions of Black people and/or discrimination by White authority figures (‘the system’). Subjects in the Discussion condition spent two minutes discussing each item prior to making their judgements. Ratings of ingroup and outgroup on eight attitudinal dimensions were also elicited, followed by a social distance measure. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed effects for racial group membership (p < 0.05) and group discussion (p < 0.05) on attributions. Further examination of the data by means of discriminant analyses indicated which items differentiate between the groups. Data based on the attitudinal ratings were also subjected to multivariate analyses and point to the positive group‐image of the Black respondents and a lack of intergroup discrimination by the White subjects; the social distance scores of the latter subjects are, however, higher. Results are discussed in terms of the literature on group polarization and intergroup differentiation.

All subjects completed a repertory grid and the Zung depression scale on admission to hospital. Depressives were characterized by lower self-esteem, more negative social perception and higher scores on the Zung scale. Both measures were repeated at the time of discharge from hospital. Depressives showed a significant reduction in depressive mood, more positive social perception, and a change in the construing of the self; controls showed no changes. It is argued that the use of a quantitative assessment technique reinforced by a theoretical framework results in a more refined understanding of psychological change.","","central nervous system; depression; major clinical study; neurosis; self esteem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00071250","","BJPYA","7296190","English","BR.

Key features included institutional support for the programme and opportunities to work as equals in pairs and small groups on shared tasks in a co-operative atmosphere. Topics included alcohol abuse, dealing with psychiatric emergencies, deliberate self-harm and community services for people with learning disabilities. A comprehensive evaluation of the effects of the programme on one cohort of 85 participants revealed that overall attitudes towards the other profession had improved and that each saw the other as more professionally competent at the end of the programme. Participants reported increased knowledge of the attitudes, skills, roles and duties of the other profession and of how to work together more effectively.","","","","","","","","","Allport G.W., The Nature of Prejudice, Reading, (1954); Amir Y., Contact hypotheis in ethnic relations, Psychological Bulletin, 71, pp. 319-342, (1969); Arescog N., The need for multiprofessional health education in undergraduate studies, Medical Education, 22, pp. 251-252, (1988); Arescog N., Multi-professional education at the undergraduate level, Inter-professional Relations in Health Care, (1995); Bassof B.Z., Ludwig S., Interdisciplinary education for health care professionals, Health and Social Work, 4, pp. 58-71, (1979); Burgess H., Jackson S., Enquiry and action learning: A new aproach to social work education, Social Work Education, 9, pp. 3-9, (1990); Campbell D.T., Stanley J.C., Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for research, Handbook of Research on Teaching, (1963); Carpenter J., Interprofessional education for medical and nursing students: Evaluation of a programme, Medical Education, 29, pp. 265-272, (1995); Carpenter J., Doctors and nurses: Stereotypes and stereotype change in interprofessional education, Journal of Interprofessional Care, 9, pp. 151-161, (1995); Carpenter J., Onyett S., Smith H., Williams J., Peck E., 'Caring for People' Joint Training Project, (1991); Report of the Inquiry into Child Abuse in Cleveland 1987, (1988); Cook S.W., Campbell D.T., Quasi-experiments: Design and Analysis Issues for Field Settings, (1979); Coulshed V., Adult learning: Implications for teaching in social work education, British Journal of Social Work, 23, pp. 1-13, (1993); Caring for People.

One‐hundred and sixty‐eight French adolescents (age 15 years) were assigned to the eight conditions of a 2 (social categorization: majority/minority) × 2 (strength of influence: strong/weak) × 2 (predisposition to influence: pervious/impervious) design. Influence source was an opinion poll based on pupils from two types of secondary school. Direct influence was exerted from ‘hard‐rock’ to ‘new wave’ music; indirect influence was measured by subjects' preferences for hard‐rock versus ‘contemporary’ music. Ratings of the source were also elicited. Analyses of variance revealed indirect influence to be significantly greater with the minority than the majority source (p < 0.02). Indirect influence was especially high for subjects with a clear predisposition to influence and when the influence was weak (p < 0.0005). Further analyses confirmed the effect to be due to the actual numbers of subjects influenced. The study thus demonstrated the generalizability of the ‘conversion’ notion (minority influence on an indirect level) from numerical to social minorities.

Participants read a (base) problem and one of three solutions (one of which is considered the 'best' solution). They then generated solutions to a second (target) problem which shared similar structural features to the first problem. Due to the similarities between problems, the solution given to the first problem can be used as an analogy in solving the second. In contrast to Nemeth's theory, when the solution to the base problem was endorsed by a numerical majority there was not an increase in analogy-transfer in solving the target problem. However, in support of Nemeth's theory, when the base solution was supported by a numerical minority then the participants were more likely to generate the 'best' solution to the target problem regardless of which base solution they were given.

Prefaced with an historical and socio-political background, this paper examines these macro strategies from a social psychological perspective in terms of assimilation and integration, highlighting the issues of ethnicity, language and intergroup relations. Although available empirical research is scarce, a variety of issues in intergroup relations have received, and deserve further, attention: social identity; ethnic group stereotypes; intergroup attributions; and social distance. The available data are integrated with a focus on the Chinese and Malay ethnic groups in both countries. Limited research on language issues is also reviewed, including work on language policy, attitudes and usage. Comparisons between Malaysia and Singapore should be made with great caution, but the offer of rich contrastive data should inspire a unique social psychological analysis of the consequences of their two different chosen strategies of de-pluralisation. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung","Colleen Ward is lecturer in psychology.

It reports the first, large‐scale, independent evaluation of this social intervention. The evaluation (based on 1245 secondary‐school pupils) compares views of the police in schools with (target) and without (control) a full‐time Schools Liaison Officer (SLO). Although attitudes to the police are marginally positive, they become less so over one year. There is no evidence that Schools Liaison input into the target schools slows or halts this decline, or that it affects perceptions of the seriousness of offences, and the likelihood of identification associated with crime. This weak impact is, at least in part, attributable to the low reported rates of direct contact, and the judged atypicality of the SLO. Target‐school pupils judged their SLO positively, but as distinct from the ‘police in general’. Their view of the SLO had a direct impact on their liking of the police in general, but there was no effect for contact. We conclude that Police‐Schools Liaison has only limited positive effects, as predicted from critiques of the traditional ‘contact hypothesis’. 1992 The British Psychological Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00071269","","","1611408","English","Br.
